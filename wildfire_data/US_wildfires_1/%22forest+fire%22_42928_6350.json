Little is known about the role of dead trees in the global carbon cycle, though. The decomposition of wood and the recycling of the nutrients it contains are among the most important processes to take place in forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How much carbon is released from decaying wood worldwide? What role do insects play in this process? These questions have now been studied in a global research project established by the Bavarian Forest National Park and coordinated by the Julius Maximilian University of Wurzburg (JMU) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p><p>An experiment at 55 different locations provides the basis</p><p>At 55 forest locations on six continents, researchers laid out wood from more than 140 tree species to assess the influence of the climate on the rate of decomposition. Half of the wood was placed in mesh cages. These cages prevented insects from being involved in the decomposition and allowed quantifying their contribution to wood decomposition..</p><p>The collected data demonstrates that the rate of decomposition and the contribution of insects are highly dependent on the climate, and increase as the temperature rises. Higher levels of precipitation accelerate the decomposition in warmer regions and slow it down in regions where the temperatures are lower.</p><p>50 research groups worldwide completed the three year experiment, sometimes under exceptionally difficult conditions. It was necessary to use elaborate measures to protect some areas from elephants. One area was lost to a forest fire and reconstructed, while another area was flooded.</p><p>Global carbon cycling</p><p>\"On the basis of the experiment, we were able to model the role that deadwood plays in the global carbon cycle,\" explains Rupert Seidl, Professor of Ecosystem Dynamics and Forest Management at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).</p><p>\"According to the report, some 10.9 giga-tons of carbon are released from deadwood worldwide every year. In this context, part of the carbon is absorbed into the soil, while another part is released into the atmosphere. The amount of carbon released from deadwood is equivalent to roughly 115 percent of the emissions from fossil fuels,\" adds Dr. Werner Rammer, a scientist at TUM who played the leading role in the global calculations.</p><p>\"At 93 percent, tropical forests contribute disproportionately to this result due to their high wood mass combined with their rapid decomposition processes. Decomposition in temperate and boreal forests is considerably slower indicating that deadwood stores carbon over long time periods in these regions. Insects account for almost one third of wood decomposition, although this is mostly confined to the tropics. In boreal and temperate forests, the contributions made by insects are small, though,\" explains PD Dr. Sebastian Seibold, lead author of the study.</p><p>The effects of global change</p><p>\"The study highlights the role played by deadwood in the global carbon cycle and the functional importance of insects in the decomposition of wood. In this way, we are closing another gap in the global modelling of carbon cycles,\" explains Professor Jorg Muller, Head of Research at the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Ecological Station at JMU Wurzburg.</p><p>\"At a time of global change, we can see some dramatic declines in biodiversity and changes in climate. This study has demonstrated that both climate change and the loss of insects have the potential to alter the decomposition of wood, and therefore, the carbon and nutrient cycles worldwide,\" explains PD Dr. Seibold.</p><p>Research Report: \"The contribution of insects to global forest deadwood decomposition\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202109020635355634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63HC-1K31-JC3D-Y2YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 2, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>deadwood-in-the-global-carbon-cycle</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

If gradual loss of for- est cover is not checked, harsher climate extremes will grip the entire region in coming decades. The 'India State of Forest Report(ISFR)-2021' has revealed that the loss of forest cover in the region is to the extent of 1020 sq. km when the country recorded an increase of 1,540 sq. </p><p>km forest cover at the national level. Climate hotspot projections 2030, 2050 and 2085 in the report indicate that the North-eastern States and Upper Malaba Coast of India are projected to experience the highest increase in rainfall, whereas states like Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are projected to experience least increase or sometimes even decline in rainfall. Worsening climate conditions will prove disastrous for the majority of the population in the region who are primarily dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. According to the report total forest cover of the region is estimated to be 1,69,521 sq. km which is 64.66% of its geographical area. The total forest cover of the country is 21.71 sq. km of total geographical area which is quite less and further decease in forest cover in the region will push the country to a precarious situation and result in difficulty to manage climate extremes. Loss of forest cover in the region is widespread and has been recorded in all north-eastern states. The eight states of the region account for 23.75% of total forest cover of the country and this huge carbon sink play a critical role in climate change mitigation for the entire globe which needs to be recognized and acknowledged. The biennial assessment of forest and tree cover has brought to the fore the most important but unsettled debate for the northeast region over making a choice between development and environment. The rationale approach is to fine balance the two which is easier said than done. In a bid to fulfil development aspirations of people, the States in the region have pushed mega projects of connectivity, hydropower generation, oil, coal, and other mineral extraction. Implementation of these projects is not possible without diversion of forests or tree felling. There are check and balances like compensatory afforestation to compensate for the loss of forest due to implementation of these projects, but the States have failed to ensure. With more mega projects in the pipeline further loss of forest cover in the region is inevitable. Pushing an alternative development that prioritizes environment and forest conservation over development projects is not possible unless the States are provided huge financial assistance in the form of grants by the Central Government to support environment-friendly development projects such eco-tourism development, cane and bamboo-based livelihood projects, textile and handicraft project, organic agriculture and horticulture projects, solar power, and small hydropower projects. Facilitating marketing support, ensuring remunerative prices, subsidising intra-regional passenger travel and goods movement are also critical to sustain these environment-friendly projects. Development of skilled workforce for services sector can create livelihood opportunities for the farm families displaced by extreme climate-driven disaster so that those families can augment their household income and savings for a comfortable life. Worsening flood and erosion problems in Assam have aggravated farmers' woes and mere announcement of livelihood schemes and projects and incentives cannot help them build resilience against climate extremes. Hand-holding support is required to help sustain eco-tourism projects or various entrepreneurial ventures. If other states want the northeast region to conserve the forest cover, they need to create a huge market for unique handicraft products and stop dumping machine-made products in the region. To help farmers in the region double their income the government must ensure procurement of their produce and reverse the movement of thousands of trucks bringing food grains to the region from other states. Regeneration of lost forest cover and ecosystem in the region is also critical to reduce disruption in rainfall pattern but to ensure protection of forests from timber smugglers every state in the region needs to raise huge forest protection force. Current state economies of the states in the region do not have enough revenue surplus to spare a huge allocation for raising the required forest protection force. The states providing financial incentives to forest fringe dwellers to augment household income in lieu of their services in forest protection can be a viable solution but will require required financial support by the Central Government. Rising incidents of man-animal conflict all over the region, rise in number of people displaced by disasters like flood, erosion, forest fire are indicators of loss of forest cover and alarming shrinkage of natural habitats. These problems will get worse if the loss of forest cover in the region continues unabated. It is hoped that the ISFR-2021 will be an eye opener for all states in the Northeast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0057772413</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64JT-7CM1-JB5M-W1CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Omega Printers &amp;

Though they were not broadcasting AIS, amateur ship-spotters recorded their movements. <br/>The voyage has raised concerns as these ships are normally attached to the Baltic Fleet. Though their final destination is unclear, the Ukrainian military believes Russia will launch anamphibious assault[2] at the port city of Odessa in the event of an invasion. The presence of the three Ropuchas would only add beach landing capacity for the Black Sea Fleet. <br/><br/>According to reports, each Ropucha class ship can carry up to 10 main battle tanks and 340 troops, 550 tons of cargo, or equivalent loads. However, it is unclear whether these vessels are currently carrying any cargo. <br/>Ever since the three Northern Fleet vessels had traveled from their home port to the Baltic via the Danish Strait on January 12, they were being monitored by the Swedish Air Force, including byGripen fighter jets[3], and the U.S. forces. <br/>While a U.S. Navy P-8A maritime patrol aircraft was noted operating off the Danish coast and over the Baltic Monday, a Swedish Air Force S 100D Argus airborne early warning and control aircraft has also been active in the region today. <br/>This reflected Sweden's statement that \"there is a risk\" despite such naval transits, including ships to and from Kaliningrad, being common. <br/>\"We have different types of sensors and systems that help us monitor the ships,\" Therese Fagerstedt, a press secretary for the Swedish Armed Forces, was quoted bylocal media[4]. <br/>Meanwhile, the three Baltic Fleet landing ships could also be headed for the Black Sea since the waters around the Crimean peninsula witnessed tensions between the Russian Navy and NATO warships. Since then, the security situation in the region has only worsened, said The Drive. <br/>Also, in case of a Ukraine invasion[5] via the southern route, the vessels would help with amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov. The arrival of two large landing ships would provide a significant addition to the Black Sea Fleet's existing resources, the report added. <br/>There is also a possibility that this is a \"transfer of assets\" as the three Ropuchas from Baltyysk are now sailing to the Kola Peninsula to take the place of the three Northern Fleet landing ships which are currently in the Baltic. <br/> Representation.

Hopefully we won't see that again.\"</p><p>The smoldering fire has not grown much for several days, after erupting last week in a surge that destroyed more than a dozen homes and nearly 60 outbuildings. The fire is just 14% contained on its northwestern edge, according to a daily fire update, meaning that that portion of the fire perimeter has enough cleared and burned-out areas that a fire it is not likely to cross it.</p><p>Many areas lining the blaze have some measure of protection called \"black line,\" which can range from 15 to 300 feet.</p><p>On Monday, work among the 468 crew members, including firefighter teams from across the country, local volunteer fire departments and contract loggers, continued to build deeper containment lines, cut down and remove fallen trees and extinguish hot spots. A heavy focus is on the northeastern and eastern sides of the fire, which is in the direction of the small town of Isabella, operations section chief Pete Glover said in a Monday briefing.</p><p>If conditions are right, Bickel said, crews will \"fight fire with fire\" later this week, starting a controlled burn to push the Greenwood fire back onto itself. An old railroad line, the Stony River Grade Road, will act as a barrier. Crews have been fortifying the length of it for days, along with Hwy. 1.</p><p>Bickel said protection of the northwest and western sides of the fire is \"looking great.\" Homes and other buildings in the town of Isabella, now about 10 miles from the fire, are being assessed for vulnerabilities, but fire officials say Ely, Babbitt, Finland and Brimson aren't in danger. Residents in the Slate Lake area were allowed to return home Saturday, but all other evacuation orders remain.</p><p>Nearly an inch of rain fell over the John Ek and Whelp fires in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and where the Quetico Provincial Park fires burn near the Canadian border and the BWCA. Neither of the uncontained John Ek and Whelp fires has grown since last week.</p><p>The Greenwood fire, which blazed so hot and fast a week ago that it created its own pyrocumulus cloud, has burned for more than two weeks. It now sits between Greenwood Lake and the intersections of county Hwy. 2 and state Hwy. 1.</p><p>A 6 p.m. Tuesday community meeting at Finland's Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center will stream live on Facebook.</p><p>Jana Hollingsworth \u00b7 218-508-2450</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN64143539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H3-D921-JC8F-K3KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 31, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Canoes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZFNUYxOUY5M0I1NEE3NUE1RjY2RjhBNjdDNjU3NkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D20W</classCode><className>DULUTH, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Ever.\"</emphasis> It was 115\u00baF. No, I did not contextualize this with paleoclimatology, because the kids were nonplussed, having recently survived <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kgw.com/article/weather/severe-weather/portland-oregon-power-outage-winter-snow-ice-storm/283-e681ed92-9cfc-45a5-ad59-3b0091518b71\">extended power outages</url>, extensive forest fire smoke, and a pandemic.

This will slow you down. Way down. Barreling your body through errands and appointments like an American is asking for trouble. Try cutting your speed by half or two-thirds. You know you're approaching the right pace when you're hydrated and not sweating outside, which was the case when I took a leisurely walk Saturday night in 91\u00baF heat.

If nighttime air cools to at least 75\u00baF, your daytime strategy becomes maintaining coolish indoor air for eight daytime hours, which is doable by holding the cool air inside with closed windows and doors, running a couple good window-unit air conditioners, and maybe hanging strategically positioned mylar over windows to reflect the sun. (Hang it on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">exterior</emphasis> of the window with paint tape; burning hot window glass doesn't help your cause.)</p><h>Air conditioners are limited</h><p>Most ACs only drop temperatures by 20\u00baF.

This means that if\u00a0 it's 115\u00baF outside and the sun is cooking your place, the indoor temperature is . . . you get the gist. Portable units are even less effective and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-portable-air-conditioner/\">are \"notorious underperformers.\"</url> Hot indoor air sets off other problems: Refrigerators inch up toward 50\u00baF and computers slow down and overheat.</p><h>Outfits matter less than you think</h><p>Many Southeast Asia residents wear long skirts and sleeves year-round. So do farmers and cowboys. It's only civilian Americans who try to cool themselves by removing most of their clothing. Sleeves are not only fine, but may well keep you cooler than sun on skin, especially if your clothing is light colored, breathable, and reasonably lightweight. No need to search for shorts.</p><h>Stop trying to be productive during high heat</h><p>Most of Phnom Penh is awake by 5:30 a.m., and it's socially acceptable to do absolutely nothing through the hottest parts of the day. Compare this to Oregon, where this week businesses slogged through afternoon workdays, causing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2021/06/old-town-voodoo-doughnut-staff-walk-out-amid-record-heat.html\">some employees to walk out.</url> The science here is that in order for your body to efficiently shed heat, skin temperature <url normalizedValue=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaaw1838\">cannot surpass</url> roughly 95\u00baF.

A nearby lake is completely drained from a decades-long drought, and uneven water restrictions have created a patchwork landscape. Most summers, fires have brought with them destruction and dangerous air quality. Just last year, a wildfire[6] forced Healy and his family to evacuate their home. Recalling one fire season in 2018, he said, 'I remember the sky being completely black, and you can't breathe, and I'd be walking home for three or four miles, just casually going, and I'd be like, 'OK, like this is like the most ridiculous thing ever.''  <br/>Now, Healy is one of millions of young people eligible to vote in the upcoming midterm elections (over 8 million of whom are newly eligible voters under 20 years old). As a young person directly affected by climate change, he's not alone. In just this past summer, young people across the country\u2014and the world\u2014have faced record-breaking hurricanes[7] and an intense and lengthy fire season[8]. <br/>The fall 2022 youth poll[9] from the Harvard Public Opinion Project showed that 'climate change is in the top tier of issues for young Americans heading into the midterms,' Alan Zhang, a junior at Harvard University and the chair of HPOP, points out. 'If we're looking at young liberals and young progressives [specifically], there's really four issues tied for first place: There's abortion, inflation, climate, and democracy.' <br/>With the 2022 midterms just around the corner\u2014and new data from the Harvard youth poll suggesting that young people are going to match record-breaking turnout levels from 2018\u2014the question of whether Gen Z will turn to the polls as a solution to the climate crisis remains. The answer, however, is complicated. <br/>'I think electoral politics are quite important,' said Kevin J. Patel, a 22-year-old climate activist and founder of the nonprofit One Up Action. In 2020 as now, Patel believes voter engagement efforts and high voter turnout are necessary priorities for climate organizations, activists, and concerned young people alike. 'If we don't have leaders who are acting on the climate crisis,' said Patel, 'we will never see the bills, we will never see the policies, we will never see the solutions that we as young people want to get passed or even implemented within our communities.' <br/>Sophia Kianni, a fellow climate activist and the founder of the multilingual climate education organization Climate Cardinals, agreed. Though elections and electoral politics are by no means the only solution, they remain 'a viable avenue for making change happen.' <br/>Like Healy, the Washington, D.C., resident has experienced worsening air quality almost comparable to that of her parents' home country of Iran, where Kianni said she 'witnessed the impacts of oil and gas pollution firsthand.' A focus on voting, then, she said, 'is one of the best ways that we can champion individual action instead of telling people to focus on their personal carbon footprint, which is really ineffective and kind of playing into what the fossil fuel industry wants.' Current Issue <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-14-21-2022-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-14-21-2022-issue/</url><br/>Climate organizers across the country are responding to this need by adding voter engagement work to their own climate advocacy. Just last year, Patel dedicated himself to Georgia's runoff elections, where getting out the vote was a priority. 'We actually did, I think, over 5,000 phone banking callswith all of our youth leaders, and that was about 30 or 40 youth leaders.' <br/>He points to statistics from organizations like the Environmental Voter Project[10], which has found that millions of 'environmentalists'\u2014including hundreds of thousands of young people\u2014failed to vote in the 2018 and 2020 elections. The Harvard youth poll, helmed by Zhang, has also found that, despite high turnout rates among Gen Z, there has also been 'an increase in sentiments such as 'politics today isn't meeting the challenges of the moment,' 'politics today is too divided.'' <br/>Kianni took a stance similar to Patel's. 'I do consider things like voter registration climate work, and I actually consider it to be one of the most crucial components of our climate work, because it's one of the biggest ways that we can actually tangibly make an impact,' said Kianni. 'I think most of the organizers and activists that I work with are doing a lot of election work.' And that election work happens across different spaces too, from social media to phone banks. <br/>Others, like Natalia Brown, a recent college graduate and climate justice program manager at Catalyst Miami, engage in electoral work more indirectly. 'We can't advance climate justice without a healthy democracy.'  <br/>Catalyst focuses specifically on economic and racial justice in communities of color, which is why they also have a strong focus on climate justice[11]. Climate change disproportionately affects low-wealth and working-class people in communities of color, said Brown. But these are also the same communities that 'face barriersthat keep them from free and fair participation in elections,' such as rigid work schedules or ballot language barriers. That's why Catalyst works in close partnership with organizations leading electoral work on the ground in Miami. At the core of it is an understanding that engaging and empowering voters leads to better leaders in office\u2014leaders who would address climate and other crises. <br/>Speaking specifically about her work in climate justice, Brown said that she focuses on government accountability year-round. 'If we only focus on building pressure during elections, we miss out on the critical months in between where large corporations lobby for policy that facilitates extractive business practices\u2014protecting outsize profits at the expense of everyday people's lives and livelihoods.'  <br/>Many young people, Gavin Healy included, just aren't convinced voting alone will be enough to avoid the existential crisis that is climate change. While Healy believes in the importance of voter engagement (he has worked on campaigns in the past), he also recognizes that 'a social shift is needed.' The United States, he said, is too hyper-individualistic and shortsighted to be able to fix the problem of our time through institutional means alone. 'Joe Biden will not get us out of this. Kamala Harris will not get us out of this. Donald Trump will really not get us out of this.' <br/>To Healy, voting for pro-climate action Democrats is not nearly enough. 'Americans [are] not really thinking how [the climate crisis] would look five or 10 years down the road, because capitalism forces you to think so narrowly,' said Healy. 'If we just had these higher systems with power that were not focused on extraction and control and imposition of power,' then more meaningful action could be taken. <br/>Ilana Cohen, a fellow organizer with Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, added further nuance. Though not involved in electoral organizing herself, she sees it as a crucial first step, but nothing more than that. 'There is no question that voting is a duty for anyone who cares about climate change, the health of our democracy, furthering social justice, or protecting our most basic rights\u2014these causes are fundamentally intertwined,' said Cohen. 'It is also only a first step. Effective climate activism requires coming together around concerted strategies to move our politics in favor of a rapid just-energy transition every single day, including specifically by continuing to diminish the power of the fossil fuel companies working to undermine this transition.' <br/>At the end of the day, though, progress on climate at the federal\u2014and local[12]\u2014level since the 2020 elections has been slow and frustrating (when it has happened at all), key legislation like the Build Back Better act and the Inflation Reduction Act is progress nonetheless. And given the extremely polarized views on climate change that permeate US politics to the point that most Republicans are anti-climate[13], it is progress that remains at risk should Democrats lose their majorities. It is within this context of US politics that local elections, such as for municipal offices and state supreme court seats, provide more direct and incredibly important focal points around which to organize pro-climate voters. <br/>'It would be really a shame for the momentum to be stalled and for any key wins to be undone,' Kianni said, referring to the meaningful, if limited, climate victories of the past year and a half and their instability in the American political system. 'There's just a lot that's hanging in the balance in terms of different key climate policies and pieces of legislation that are going to be potentially passed.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

She talked about her landscape photos as a part of the Embassy's 'Rethink Tomorrow' conversation series.</p><p>The hour-long conversation was moderated by Helene Larsson Pousette, the cultural counselor of the Swedish Embassy. The discussion addressed how humanity's actions may destroy nature and how Schmitz's photography unintentionally took a political stand.</p><p>\"Dreamland\" is a photo exhibition that focuses on two locations in Sweden: \"Bedrock\" features photos from the Atik mine located outside the municipality of G\u00e4llivare, and \"The Forest\" reveals the aftermath of a forest fire in V\u00e4stmanland County.</p><p>The discussion centered around human-induced actions causing the reduction of natural reserves on Earth and ensured that people reflect on their own habits. The power of Schmitz's photographs rests in the nuanced understanding of art appreciation, and a key theme throughout her photographs is how humans have coexisted with nature.</p><p>\"We have lost our sense of belonging, in that we don't use nature just as a commodity,\" Schmitz said during the Q&amp;A session. \"We are part of a system with all other living species and we need to do things on a smaller scale because we will ruin not only other living species but also ourselves in the end.\"</p><p>With patience and honesty, Schmitz expressed deep gratitude for the opportunity to display her art. Schmitz continued that there needs to be a shift in how people take care of the biodiversity and important industries in Sweden.</p><p>\"It was so obvious to me how we have turned nature into something completely abstract,\" Schmitz said.</p><p>Schmitz stated she is always in complete control of the photo process from start to finish. By narrowing in on two specific scenes, the photographs capture a special moment in time that places the viewer right in the middle of the problem.</p><p>Schmitz's art is able to tackle a complicated topic in her photographs and discuss it, but in a nonpartisan setting; and because her photos do not involve inflammatory or triggering scenes or an obvious political leaning, it seems clear she understands how to deliver her message to people who come from diverse backgrounds and cultural ideologies.</p><p>\"I don't think art or artists should do anything [to influence politics]. As an artist you are free to do whatever you wish to do,\" Schmitz said. \"But for my part, it was a natural process and then I think I have been inspired by news... and what's going on in contemporary society.\"</p><p>Though Schmitz's passion is derived from a personal place, she said she doesn't feel that her photography morphs in tandem with her political views.</p><p>\"I'm not considering myself even now a political artist, and I don't define myself as being that; but on the other hand you could say that any photograph of a landscape is political,\" Schmitz said. \"I mean you deliberately take a political standpoint when you choose how to show a landscape ... This [photo series] is just something that I felt I had to do.\"</p><p>'Dreamland' will be on display at the House of Sweden in D.C. until December 2021.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hlangenfeld@theeagleonline.com\">hlangenfeld@theeagleonline.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5033398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632B-69V1-JBSN-303G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Eagle: American University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 1, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Washington</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>DC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Criminal Law &amp; Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Photo Identifications</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjMzQ0IwQTVGQjEzNDg0Njg5MDUwREY0MjE2RDNFOUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mjk5NDkwMjRGREU3NEZFN0JEODU3ODJGNUMxNThFMkU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002022</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp; CONSULATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002022</classCode><className>PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC326</classCode><className>SWEDEN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.</p><p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call.</p><p>I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional, who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team.</p><p>Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy. And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond.</p><p>During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations. There were four important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Penasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the union representing our workforce in Mexico.</p><p>This dispute is associated with a profit sharing agreement that we made with the union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor.</p><p>At Newmont, Penasquito sits within a strong, balanced, global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important tie for Penasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleon Gomez to cease this strike action and return their members to work.</p><p>The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Eleonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance.</p><p>Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for two weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there. And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the Akyem pit over the next few months.</p><p>As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year and will be driven by higher grade and tons mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tons mined at Cerro Negro as the first wave of our district expansions comes online in the third quarter. Higher tons mined and processed at Tanami where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run of mine ore processed at Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our two non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance.</p><p>We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.</p><p>We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp four years ago as we build out our integration plans. We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, making the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to re-sequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years.</p><p>At Newmont, we recognize that a strong safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable, well-run business, it is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability.</p><p>In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack to the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving values-based decisions. Over the last five years, as our Senior Vice President of Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination.</p><p>I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.</p><p>Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with five additional trucks as we increase the planned waste movement in both the north and the south pits. This investment into the next laybacks at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.</p><p>Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the northern territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation at Tanami.</p><p>Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we worked through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months. As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges.</p><p>At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we accessed the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Combined [Phonetic] with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year. And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation and bulk earthworks continue to progress very well, and with a new mining fleet in place the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year.</p><p>Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June as the fire fronts [Phonetic] approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Eleanor on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was and will always be the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We are now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate, and we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis.</p><p>Moving to Porcupine. We delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year, driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the Pamour pit and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024.</p><p>At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progressed planned development activities that will increase stope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double-lift stope. As a consequence, we expect tons mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter.</p><p>And finally, Cripple Creek &amp; Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities.</p><p>And now, moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance.</p><p>Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tons mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to. And grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of six new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023.</p><p>Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Penasquito on June 7 as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Penasquito.</p><p>And now, I'll wrap up on the next slide with our two non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second halves.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Karyn Ovelmen:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have.</p><p>Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success.</p><p>Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed my initial expectations. Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle.</p><p>Turning to the next slide, let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by draw on receivables. We would expect the draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters, the tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years.</p><p>In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and margins in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest, and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items. Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Penasquito since the strike commenced, and at Eleonore while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires.</p><p>As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last two quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the timeline from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Karyn. Over the last two months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions, whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood.</p><p>Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government.</p><p>Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials, including Prime Minister James Marape, Deputy Prime Minister John Russo and Mining Minister Sir Ano Pala. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Wafi-Golpu project.</p><p>We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio, then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results.</p><p>With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today goes to Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Greg, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thank you very much. Tom, I just wanted to ask about inflationary pressures and how you see them evolving into the second half of '23 and '24, ex any volume improvements you're going to get, which obviously will help on a gold per ounce basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Greg, and good morning. What we're seeing in our direct cost is largely consistent with what we expected as we guided this year, and I'll just step through that in a little bit more detail. About half our cost base is labor, about 50% is labor, made up pretty evenly between employees and contractors. Employees largely stable and expect that to remain largely stable through the rest of this year and into next. Certainly seeing some settling down in Australia, Canada, United States. Contracted services also have stabilized. So still at a higher cost that we saw with the inflation coming through last year, but largely stabilized, maybe a little bit of easing into the second half of this year, but certainly seeing the volatility come out of that, and that's at 50%, that's a pretty important driver.</p><p>30% is materials and consumables. So it's the various reagents, particularly cyanide, explosive, steel for grinding media and the like. We're seeing those largely consistent with what we expected. Natural gas prices have come off, which is then flowing through to the prices that we're seeing for both cyanide and explosives. So, a little bit of relief tailwinds with those consumables and would expect that to flow through the second half of this year. We'll see supply of natural gas may be tighten a bit, which may put a bit more tension on those prices, but certainly expecting to see that stable or a little bit of an improvement and still pretty much holding its own as we look at the grinding median removed around the place.</p><p>And then, the next big category is fuel and energy, 15%, and that's driven by diesel. And we've certainly seen some relief in oil prices relative to what we've assumed. And we would expect to see that carry on through the second half of this year, but a volatile commodity and one that we'll continue to be conservative as we think about our assumptions for that. So, a few tailwinds, Greg, some stability and consistent with what we expected for 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Great. That's very helpful, Tom. And just a follow-on. In the presentation, you talked about the guidance you're going to provide in February. I'm just wondering how detailed do you expect to be in February around Newcrest and your expectations for how that's going to fold into the company in '24?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We're certainly working towards being in a position where we can give you a view of 2024 for the combined portfolio, which would include our view of the five Newcrest assets being folded into our operations. So, if things continue to go to plan in terms of regulatory approvals, shareholder votes and close, integration planning busily being done. We'll receive the keys to the car so to speak in early November, I would hope, and that gives us time to work through those mine plans, apply the Newmont lens on those mine plans and the assumptions we make for some of the key input assumptions and certainly working towards being in a position to provide the 2024 guidance for the combined portfolio in the February time frame.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>And what about the three to five-year guidance beyond that? Will that wait?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We will monitor that and see how those numbers come together. We'll certainly be looking in the 2024 time frame to provide as much information as we think appropriate, certainly for 2024 in that February time frame, and look for a logical time for a Capital Markets Day to share some more information on the combined portfolio and maybe even look to try and include some sort of site visit with that. So that's still work in progress, Greg. But certainly, 2024 is in our side for the February timeframe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Okay. Thank you, Tom. That's it from me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Greg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question goes to Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, Tom and team. My first question with regards to the transaction, could you tell me did the independent adviser or the independent expert for Newcrest reach that conclusion yet?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Anita, and thank you for dialing in. I think that might be a little vacation period for you. So good to hear your voice, and hopefully you can get off this call and back to some better years of time. We're still working through that process. So that's their working -- it's in train [Phonetic] working through, but not finished yet. So it's -- but it's on schedule in terms of when we need that information in order to be able to proceed for the time line we had in the deck.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, the second question, and then I'll go back into the queue. I'm just trying to get some of the grades that Rob quickly went through in terms of -- so let's start with Musselwhite. I think they said 30% improvement in tons mined and then grades by 40%. Is that Q3 or Q4? If I do that in Q3, I get well above your guide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We're certainly starting to see a step-up in grade in both Q3 and Q4 -- pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4 for Musselwhite. Anita, we're opening up with a nice double lift stope coming on, which is going to give us both some improvement in grade and volume. And then, we've got some stopes and some high-grade material also coming on as a result of the work in the first half. So, pretty consistent grade brought through the second half and certainly seeing a step-up in volume coming out. That will ramp up over the third and fourth quarter. So, the highest volume through the mill in the fourth quarter rate pretty consistent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, just in terms of -- I think at Ahafo where you were talking -- or maybe it was achieved a 35% uptick in grades in Q3. Is that correct?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Anita. So, in Akyem, we stepped out into stockpiles, got the -- I mean, if those of you who know Akyem, it's a long narrow pit and so as we're getting the last of the ore from the bottom of the pit and the current layback and wanting to bring down the next layback, we want to make sure that we maximize that also. We stepped out of the pit, made sure catch benches and the like rolling good shape, and swung into the stockpiles we would have been in, in the fourth quarter. And now, we're back in that ore. And so, we basically got right of mine -- high grade ore from the bottom of the pit coming through. You'll see most of that through the -- actually now you see a good portion of that through the -- build through the third and fourth quarter now. It's the highest grades in the fourth quarter building up through the third.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then lastly, at Cerro Negro, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So, 30% increase in tons mined and 50% increase in grade, but I don't think Rob said which quarter it was. Is that -- does that start in Q3 or is it Q4 weighted?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We see the step-up in grade at Cerro Negro pretty consistent through the third and fourth quarter at Cerro Negro. And then, you'll actually see -- you see quite a step-up in tons mined as we've got more ability to access ore particularly as we start to extract ore from San Marcos for the first time. So, pretty consistent second half across Q3 and Q4 in terms of material coming through the mill and the grades looking pretty consistent through those two quarters. Rob?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>That's correct. [Indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Anita, probably one other on Ahafo. We've got the stars really lining up in terms of the real sweet spot in the Subika open pit as well as now having the third level of Subika Underground open -- more than 20 draw points open. So, we've got both the combination of high grades and tons coming out of open pit and underground at Ahafo. So, it's another important one to be thinking about as you think about second half of the year. But that's certainly fourth quarter weighted as that comes through -- building through the third or the fourth quarter is a strong one at Ahafo with the stars lining up in both open pit and underground with mine sequences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Mike Parkin of National Bank. Mike, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Can you just give a bit more color in terms of the background on pausing at Cerro Negro in mining and does it have -- with what you've kind of investigated and decided on a go-forward basis, does it have any material impact on the cost structure of that asset going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Mike. Certainly, absolutely no impact on cost structure going forward. It was from time to time, certainly my experience and Rob's experience, you'll get an event, and we had a significant potential event in the underground mine and involved a loader that we weren't happy that we had the control environment in to be managing at the standard that we'd expect around -- basically, it was a piece of equipment involved in an incident.</p><p>It's a remote mine. As you know, Cerro Negro is in a very remote part of Argentina in Patagonia. And we wanted to ensure that the standards that we expect, we're clear across the four crews that were there and that we went through the underground mine and did the appropriate inspections to make sure that equipment and conditions underground were well understood. You're obviously working underground in a remote location. So, it's briefly important that we can be satisfied that the expectations are well understood and the conditions underground are well understood.</p><p>We're also entering into a second half, which is a step-up in both grade and tons. So we're moving into a period of time where we're going to be asking the team to step up and be working more fronts. So, we took the time to ensure that conditions were clear and expectations were set. There's nothing in terms of additional cost base, it's more about just ensuring that the leaders at all levels and their mining teams are understanding the standards that we expect and that we can confidently move forward with mining what will be a strong second half at Cerro Negro.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Great. So pretty much to sum up, it's more kind of ensuring operational best practices of Newmont being executed at that site.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Mike. We will do that from time to time in my experience. There are times when you must always maintain a chronic unease with safety, and there will be events that come from time to time and part of maintaining solid safety performance is recognizing when you may need to just pause and ensure everyone's got their mind on the game, understand what's expected and then move forward with confidence. And so, that's something we do from time to time. Certainly, Cerro Negro we cited that this needed a couple of weeks down.</p><p>I'd expect, as we do our integration planning for Newcrest and think about five new operations coming into our portfolio, think about the work we might do through November and December, that's certainly one of the debates we're having in terms of how do we ensure that the standards that we expect at Newmont are there in place in day one of those new crystal operations. So, it's something that certainly both Rob and I have done in our careers from time to time when we see a need to reset expectations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Excellent. And just one question on Penasquito. With respect to the stream, is there any minimum delivery of silver that you're tied to or are you fully free to shut down and not deliver silver when you're not producing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's correct. That's my understanding, Mike. We'll get the team to just run that to ground. And it's different from that, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's it from me guys. Thanks so much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Michael.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Tanya, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my question. Wanted to ask about Penasquito, just to get some clarification just from so many news articles that keep coming out. I'm just trying to understand with the union being on June 8, I just want to make sure that I understood some of the articles that came out. Has the union gone to paying the workers, because my understanding was the workers aren't being paid being on strike, that the union has gone in to pay the workers? Do we know if that's a correct statement from some of the papers I was reading?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Tanya, that's correct. The members -- the union members who are on strike are not being paid by the union that they're members of. And as part of our position at the negotiating table, we're not paying back pay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So the union is not paying and you're not paying. So they haven't been paid since June 8.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. So, workforce of some 2,000 people are being paid. You've got a much bigger contractor workforce that aren't being paid. You've got an extended community. There's some 28,000 people that rely upon those wages to receive some benefits. They're not being paid. We're the biggest taxpayer in the state of Zacatecas. They're not getting taxes. And our contributions are close to $2 billion a year to the Mexican government through both taxes and royalties are not currently being paid. So, our message to the union leadership is, we have a fair and equitable agreement. We paid in accordance with that, and we strongly encourage them to get their members back to work so that we can start paying wages again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's just there was an article, Tom, that's saying that the union leader -- the union was taking money from their coffers and paying the workers, I just wanted to clarify that. And just how should we think about the cost of the -- on a monthly basis, being on care and maintenance as we go into July, how should I think, number one, what sort of cost should I be thinking about you incurring on care and maintenance? And number two, would that be coming through the operating costs or would you take that out and put it under other? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Anita [Phonetic]. So, you'll see -- and I'll get Daniel to catch up with you after the call, but we've got something in our earnings release. If you think about those costs through the month of June, at Penasquito, we incurred $23 million of operating costs, another $15 million in depreciation due to the suspension of operations. So, it's down for most of June. That's a pretty good indicator of what that's going to look like.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And I would run that through the cost, you're not going to take it out separately. Sometimes you've taken it out and excluded it out of operating costs into other items.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>No, we don't plan to do that, Tanya. So what you described is how best to model it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you for that. And then, if I could just go back to Anita's question on just the second half performance with some of the mines that I think Cerro Negro would be evenly distributed, Ahafo and Mussel are going to get higher Q4. Is there any other operation that's going to have a higher Q4 because when I look at the numbers, you're looking at a production profile of Q4 being significantly stronger than Q3. Is that how I should think about it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. Tanya, we're building towards a strong fourth quarter, you've got -- you'll have across some of the parts of the world in which we operate, you tend to get a bit more wet weather in the third quarter. So you typically see us have those drier locations that really bring it home in the fourth quarter. Pueblo Viejo ramping up with 40% of Pueblo Viejo, that's an important part of H2, Nevada Gold Mines guiding to a strong second half. That's an important part of our H2. Tanami, we have got pretty consistent tons through the mill in the second half, but we move into our highest grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So that's an important story. And I think we probably covered the -- most of the Merian certainly got a stronger second -- pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4. So I think we've covered the sort of the key drivers of H1 versus H2 and where the higher fourth quarter would come from.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. No, I appreciate that. Just when you look at the production profile, excluding Penasquito depending on what happens there, it is looking at the fourth quarter is the one that is going to carry quite a bit of weight for your -- in order to get your guidance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Tanya. [Speech Overlap]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>And if I could just do one final question -- sorry?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Go forward, Tanya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Sorry, I cut you out to say something else. Just another follow-up on Greg's questions on the inflationary release that you were seeing. I just wanted to confirm because some companies are not seeing exactly the same thing. Would be also fair to say that you are seeing cyanide pricing coming down relative to what you have. And I just kind of wonder in your agreement, do we stock your inventories on these lower level prices that are out there. Some contracts -- some come up in three months, six months. I'm just wondering how -- when we are expecting you to renegotiate at these lower levels, so we can see when those would go through your cost structure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>So, Tanya, we -- our supply chain strategy, particularly with our key commodities is to have strategic contracts that are long-term based upon the size of our portfolio, and we built into those rise in full calculations. So, we pretty much then become a price taker but at a competitive price. And then, we -- and then we'll have flowed through the -- as you see, prices go up and down, we have some relief in terms of the volatility about price increases or price decreases. And then, with the inventories we have at sites, it takes a little while for that to flow through.</p><p>So, we are -- on the back of natural gas prices coming off, we are seeing ammonia prices down, caustic soda prices are also down and where we are seeing improvement in both cyanide cost and explosive costs. So that is flowing through and it's linked to click back to that key commodity price, and it's flowing through our contracts. It will wash through our inventories, and we just continue to -- through those contracts, take the prices as we have agreed in those contracts, and that then takes normally a month or two or three to flow through our inventories.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And so, those you could [Phonetic] see them coming in Q3 and into Q4?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, we'll see some of that benefit in Q3 and Q4, absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thank you. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Tanya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Brian MacArthur of Raymond James. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning. Can I just follow up on Penasquito. Tanya covered the ongoing cost, but where is the concentrate situation? Is there concentrate in transit that's off-site that's provisionally priced and you're going to have some sales in Q3 if nothing happens? I was looking at your sales versus your production, and I know it varies quarter-by-quarter and lead versus zinc. Where are we on that? Is there actually a cash inflow to you from concentrator? Is it all stuck at site or where is that situation at the moment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Brian. So there's nothing left to put in all the sales being recognized in the second quarter. So there's nothing in the supply chain from the mine site to the smelters that hasn't been sold and recognized. And then, we have a small amount of concentrate stockpile on site but not much. Sites have [Phonetic] been put into care and maintenance in very good neck and everything is safe and secure onsite. So, the expectation that common sense prevails and we've got a workforce back at work, we can ramp up very quickly with a lot of experience in being able to ramp up from the pandemic days. So we know how to get that big mine back up and running and producing concentrate very quickly. So, it's pretty clean in terms of where we sit with the concentrates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks very much, Tom.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brian.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, a few more questions in terms of the details. At Tanami, could you just go over what you're looking for in terms of grades and tons in Q4, Q3?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>No problems, Tanya. The Q3...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Did I call you -- sorry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>I live in the flow. My apologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>And you called Tanya, Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>I think I did. That's when Daniel was writing me notes. Tanya, if you're still listening, my apologies, and I needed my apologies. Obviously, I need a holiday. Sorry, I'm embarrassed. The high grades are in the fourth quarter. You'll actually see a little bit of a step up in the third quarter from what we were able to see in the second, and then we get into some nice high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So, pretty consistent through the mill and a step-up in the third and fourth quarter as they're free and clear of some of the disruption from the weather in the first half. So, you see a step-up in volumes through the mill, but the real grades flow in the fourth quarter. Nothing outrageous. Certainly well within the grades that we've seen historically.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, in terms of the project, I was noticing the spend at the different projects. And Tanami looks -- I mean, I don't really -- we don't really have sort of like the -- or maybe I've lost track of the amount of time that it's going to take to build out these projects. We are in the process like a percentage just from a time standpoint. But Ahafo North, it seems like the spend is not -- it's got the same start-up as Tanami expansion and I only see about 30% of the spend and where Tanami is about half the spend. So, could you just give us a little color on the time frames and the cadence of spending at both Tanami and Ahafo North?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I'll start off, Anita, and Rob might want to build on this. But Ahafo North has really been a first half or a quarter of just getting the work fronts opened up. So, a lot of clearing of land, bringing equipment in, and so gearing up with positioning ourselves to really get stuck into doing the pre-strip work and then the civil works will then start constructing the processing plant and other infrastructure. So, it's in a process of gearing up and then be able to accelerate up in terms of an open pit mine with a processing plant.</p><p>Tanami, where is probably -- we're in that serious process of stepping through the shaft, doing the concrete lining and then bringing in the various facilities that get attached to that concrete wall. So that's now starting to get a pretty steady state for that critical path item. The other thing that's largely -- the surface work in terms of most infrastructure is largely done. So clearly there's a whole bunch of winding equipment to install at the appropriate time on surface and not completely done. But at Tanami, we've got the underground excavation, it's all done, but you're really in that process now mobilizing those construction crews underground to start building out the conveyors and the crushers and all the supporting infrastructure for that. So, gearing up to get that work front really going ahead. So, quite different projects in terms of infrastructure underground, shaft lining and then building an open pit mine and the associated infrastructure.</p><p>Rob, anything you add on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Anita, I would just emphasize what Tom said, a number of fronts that we're actively working on at Tanami is far larger than Ahafo North. So, every part of that project is getting worked on. And as Tom said, Ahafo North and seeing it just a month or so ago, the civil works is progressing very, very well. And in the coming months, that's when we will see significant spend, whether it be the contractors coming in, it's the steel getting erected, it's the hiring of cranes, it's the digging of tranches, etc, it's the construction of the tailings dams. So, as the next few months passes, the number of fronts that we start working on at Ahafo North significantly increases. And as such, we'll see that increase in spend as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>And then, in terms of that work, how much has been sort of like, I guess, committed or how much of that work in the next -- in the back half of this year and early next year, do you have a visibility on the cost level?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>In terms of, Anita...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>I guess I'm just trying to understand that if you haven't -- what I was trying to understand is, if you haven't really started getting into the guts of it, how certain are you that the capex guidance range is still good?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>The key thing, which I'd certainly see, Anita, is that on the procurement side of things that we have basically secured just about all the supplies for both the projects, and I think that protects us enormously. The engineering that we've also done on both projects is at a significant level as well. So, we've got a large degree of confidence. The biggest thing is always is with shaft building. We progressed down there. And at the moment, we're aligning that very well. We've got patches of overbreak, which we'll deal with. But at the moment, because of the engineering, the procurement, we're still very much on track.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you. That's it for my questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, operator. Just a quick one for Mike Parkin's question. Just confirm there's no minimum payment on the silver stream, Mike, if you're still listening on the call. Thank you all for making the time for the call this quarter, and please enjoy the rest of your day, and thank you for your time. Thanks, everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-ecc8ebfce7b959579cc15d8b701733c3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-WWW3-RTMS-H2R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.</p><p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call.</p><p>I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional, who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team.</p><p>Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy. And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond.</p><p>During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations. There were four important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Penasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the union representing our workforce in Mexico.</p><p>This dispute is associated with a profit sharing agreement that we made with the union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor.</p><p>At Newmont, Penasquito sits within a strong, balanced, global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important tie for Penasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleon Gomez to cease this strike action and return their members to work.</p><p>The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Eleonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance.</p><p>Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for two weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there. And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the Akyem pit over the next few months.</p><p>As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year and will be driven by higher grade and tons mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tons mined at Cerro Negro as the first wave of our district expansions comes online in the third quarter. Higher tons mined and processed at Tanami where we will mine the highest grades for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run of mine ore processed at Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our two non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance.</p><p>We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.</p><p>We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp four years ago as we build out our integration plans. We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, making the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to re-sequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years.</p><p>At Newmont, we recognize that a strong safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable, well-run business, it is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability.</p><p>In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack to the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving values-based decisions. Over the last five years, as our Senior Vice President of Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance, in particular in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination.</p><p>I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.</p><p>Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with five additional trucks as we increase the planned waste movement in both the north and the south pits. This investment into the next laybacks at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.</p><p>Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the northern territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation at Tanami.</p><p>Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we worked through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months. As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges.</p><p>At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we accessed the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Combined [Phonetic] with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year. And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation and bulk earthworks continue to progress very well, and with a new mining fleet in place the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year.</p><p>Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June as the fire fronts [Phonetic] approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Eleanor on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was and will always be the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We are now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate, and we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis.</p><p>Moving to Porcupine. We delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year, driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the Pamour pit and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024.</p><p>At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progressed planned development activities that will increase stope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double-lift stope. As a consequence, we expect tons mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter.</p><p>And finally, Cripple Creek &amp; Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities.</p><p>And now, moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance.</p><p>Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tons mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to. And grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of six new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023.</p><p>Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Penasquito on June 7 as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Penasquito.</p><p>And now, I'll wrap up on the next slide with our two non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second halves.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Karyn Ovelmen:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have.</p><p>Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success.</p><p>Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed my initial expectations. Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle.</p><p>Turning to the next slide, let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by draw on receivables. We would expect the draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters, the tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years.</p><p>In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and margins in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest, and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items. Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Penasquito since the strike commenced, and at Eleonore while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires.</p><p>As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last two quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the timeline from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Karyn. Over the last two months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions, whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood.</p><p>Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government.</p><p>Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials, including Prime Minister James Marape, Deputy Prime Minister John Russo and Mining Minister Sir Ano Pala. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Wafi-Golpu project.</p><p>We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio, then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results.</p><p>With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today goes to Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Greg, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Thank you very much. Tom, I just wanted to ask about inflationary pressures and how you see them evolving into the second half of '23 and '24, ex any volume improvements you're going to get, which obviously will help on a gold per ounce basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Greg, and good morning. What we're seeing in our direct cost is largely consistent with what we expected as we guided this year, and I'll just step through that in a little bit more detail. About half our cost base is labor, about 50% is labor, made up pretty evenly between employees and contractors. Employees largely stable and expect that to remain largely stable through the rest of this year and into next. Certainly seeing some settling down in Australia, Canada, United States. Contracted services also have stabilized. So still at a higher cost that we saw with the inflation coming through last year, but largely stabilized, maybe a little bit of easing into the second half of this year, but certainly seeing the volatility come out of that, and that's at 50%, that's a pretty important driver.</p><p>30% is materials and consumables. So it's the various reagents, particularly cyanide, explosive, steel for grinding media and the like. We're seeing those largely consistent with what we expected. Natural gas prices have come off, which is then flowing through to the prices that we're seeing for both cyanide and explosives. So, a little bit of relief tailwinds with those consumables and would expect that to flow through the second half of this year. We'll see supply of natural gas may be tighten a bit, which may put a bit more tension on those prices, but certainly expecting to see that stable or a little bit of an improvement and still pretty much holding its own as we look at the grinding median removed around the place.</p><p>And then, the next big category is fuel and energy, 15%, and that's driven by diesel. And we've certainly seen some relief in oil prices relative to what we've assumed. And we would expect to see that carry on through the second half of this year, but a volatile commodity and one that we'll continue to be conservative as we think about our assumptions for that. So, a few tailwinds, Greg, some stability and consistent with what we expected for 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Great. That's very helpful, Tom. And just a follow-on. In the presentation, you talked about the guidance you're going to provide in February. I'm just wondering how detailed do you expect to be in February around Newcrest and your expectations for how that's going to fold into the company in '24?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We're certainly working towards being in a position where we can give you a view of 2024 for the combined portfolio, which would include our view of the five Newcrest assets being folded into our operations. So, if things continue to go to plan in terms of regulatory approvals, shareholder votes and close, integration planning busily being done. We'll receive the keys to the car so to speak in early November, I would hope, and that gives us time to work through those mine plans, apply the Newmont lens on those mine plans and the assumptions we make for some of the key input assumptions and certainly working towards being in a position to provide the 2024 guidance for the combined portfolio in the February time frame.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>And what about the three to five-year guidance beyond that? Will that wait?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We will monitor that and see how those numbers come together. We'll certainly be looking in the 2024 time frame to provide as much information as we think appropriate, certainly for 2024 in that February time frame, and look for a logical time for a Capital Markets Day to share some more information on the combined portfolio and maybe even look to try and include some sort of site visit with that. So that's still work in progress, Greg. But certainly, 2024 is in our side for the February timeframe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Barnes:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Okay. Thank you, Tom. That's it from me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Greg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question goes to Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, Tom and team. My first question with regards to the transaction, could you tell me did the independent adviser or the independent expert for Newcrest reach that conclusion yet?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Anita, and thank you for dialing in. I think that might be a little vacation period for you. So good to hear your voice, and hopefully you can get off this call and back to some better years of time. We're still working through that process. So that's their working -- it's in train [Phonetic] working through, but not finished yet. So it's -- but it's on schedule in terms of when we need that information in order to be able to proceed for the time line we had in the deck.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, the second question, and then I'll go back into the queue. I'm just trying to get some of the grades that Rob quickly went through in terms of -- so let's start with Musselwhite. I think they said 30% improvement in tons mined and then grades by 40%. Is that Q3 or Q4? If I do that in Q3, I get well above your guide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We're certainly starting to see a step-up in grade in both Q3 and Q4 -- pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4 for Musselwhite. Anita, we're opening up with a nice double lift stope coming on, which is going to give us both some improvement in grade and volume. And then, we've got some stopes and some high-grade material also coming on as a result of the work in the first half. So, pretty consistent grade brought through the second half and certainly seeing a step-up in volume coming out. That will ramp up over the third and fourth quarter. So, the highest volume through the mill in the fourth quarter rate pretty consistent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, just in terms of -- I think at Ahafo where you were talking -- or maybe it was achieved a 35% uptick in grades in Q3. Is that correct?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Anita. So, in Akyem, we stepped out into stockpiles, got the -- I mean, if those of you who know Akyem, it's a long narrow pit and so as we're getting the last of the ore from the bottom of the pit and the current layback and wanting to bring down the next layback, we want to make sure that we maximize that also. We stepped out of the pit, made sure catch benches and the like rolling good shape, and swung into the stockpiles we would have been in, in the fourth quarter. And now, we're back in that ore. And so, we basically got right of mine -- high grade ore from the bottom of the pit coming through. You'll see most of that through the -- actually now you see a good portion of that through the -- build through the third and fourth quarter now. It's the highest grades in the fourth quarter building up through the third.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then lastly, at Cerro Negro, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So, 30% increase in tons mined and 50% increase in grade, but I don't think Rob said which quarter it was. Is that -- does that start in Q3 or is it Q4 weighted?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>We see the step-up in grade at Cerro Negro pretty consistent through the third and fourth quarter at Cerro Negro. And then, you'll actually see -- you see quite a step-up in tons mined as we've got more ability to access ore particularly as we start to extract ore from San Marcos for the first time. So, pretty consistent second half across Q3 and Q4 in terms of material coming through the mill and the grades looking pretty consistent through those two quarters. Rob?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>That's correct. [Indecipherable]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Anita, probably one other on Ahafo. We've got the stars really lining up in terms of the real sweet spot in the Subika open pit as well as now having the third level of Subika Underground open -- more than 20 draw points open. So, we've got both the combination of high grades and tons coming out of open pit and underground at Ahafo. So, it's another important one to be thinking about as you think about second half of the year. But that's certainly fourth quarter weighted as that comes through -- building through the third or the fourth quarter is a strong one at Ahafo with the stars lining up in both open pit and underground with mine sequences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Mike Parkin of National Bank. Mike, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Can you just give a bit more color in terms of the background on pausing at Cerro Negro in mining and does it have -- with what you've kind of investigated and decided on a go-forward basis, does it have any material impact on the cost structure of that asset going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Mike. Certainly, absolutely no impact on cost structure going forward. It was from time to time, certainly my experience and Rob's experience, you'll get an event, and we had a significant potential event in the underground mine and involved a loader that we weren't happy that we had the control environment in to be managing at the standard that we'd expect around -- basically, it was a piece of equipment involved in an incident.</p><p>It's a remote mine. As you know, Cerro Negro is in a very remote part of Argentina in Patagonia. And we wanted to ensure that the standards that we expect, we're clear across the four crews that were there and that we went through the underground mine and did the appropriate inspections to make sure that equipment and conditions underground were well understood. You're obviously working underground in a remote location. So, it's briefly important that we can be satisfied that the expectations are well understood and the conditions underground are well understood.</p><p>We're also entering into a second half, which is a step-up in both grade and tons. So we're moving into a period of time where we're going to be asking the team to step up and be working more fronts. So, we took the time to ensure that conditions were clear and expectations were set. There's nothing in terms of additional cost base, it's more about just ensuring that the leaders at all levels and their mining teams are understanding the standards that we expect and that we can confidently move forward with mining what will be a strong second half at Cerro Negro.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Great. So pretty much to sum up, it's more kind of ensuring operational best practices of Newmont being executed at that site.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Mike. We will do that from time to time in my experience. There are times when you must always maintain a chronic unease with safety, and there will be events that come from time to time and part of maintaining solid safety performance is recognizing when you may need to just pause and ensure everyone's got their mind on the game, understand what's expected and then move forward with confidence. And so, that's something we do from time to time. Certainly, Cerro Negro we cited that this needed a couple of weeks down.</p><p>I'd expect, as we do our integration planning for Newcrest and think about five new operations coming into our portfolio, think about the work we might do through November and December, that's certainly one of the debates we're having in terms of how do we ensure that the standards that we expect at Newmont are there in place in day one of those new crystal operations. So, it's something that certainly both Rob and I have done in our careers from time to time when we see a need to reset expectations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Excellent. And just one question on Penasquito. With respect to the stream, is there any minimum delivery of silver that you're tied to or are you fully free to shut down and not deliver silver when you're not producing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's correct. That's my understanding, Mike. We'll get the team to just run that to ground. And it's different from that, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's it from me guys. Thanks so much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Michael.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Tanya, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my question. Wanted to ask about Penasquito, just to get some clarification just from so many news articles that keep coming out. I'm just trying to understand with the union being on June 8, I just want to make sure that I understood some of the articles that came out. Has the union gone to paying the workers, because my understanding was the workers aren't being paid being on strike, that the union has gone in to pay the workers? Do we know if that's a correct statement from some of the papers I was reading?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Tanya, that's correct. The members -- the union members who are on strike are not being paid by the union that they're members of. And as part of our position at the negotiating table, we're not paying back pay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So the union is not paying and you're not paying. So they haven't been paid since June 8.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. So, workforce of some 2,000 people are being paid. You've got a much bigger contractor workforce that aren't being paid. You've got an extended community. There's some 28,000 people that rely upon those wages to receive some benefits. They're not being paid. We're the biggest taxpayer in the state of Zacatecas. They're not getting taxes. And our contributions are close to $2 billion a year to the Mexican government through both taxes and royalties are not currently being paid. So, our message to the union leadership is, we have a fair and equitable agreement. We paid in accordance with that, and we strongly encourage them to get their members back to work so that we can start paying wages again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's just there was an article, Tom, that's saying that the union leader -- the union was taking money from their coffers and paying the workers, I just wanted to clarify that. And just how should we think about the cost of the -- on a monthly basis, being on care and maintenance as we go into July, how should I think, number one, what sort of cost should I be thinking about you incurring on care and maintenance? And number two, would that be coming through the operating costs or would you take that out and put it under other? Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Thanks, Anita [Phonetic]. So, you'll see -- and I'll get Daniel to catch up with you after the call, but we've got something in our earnings release. If you think about those costs through the month of June, at Penasquito, we incurred $23 million of operating costs, another $15 million in depreciation due to the suspension of operations. So, it's down for most of June. That's a pretty good indicator of what that's going to look like.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And I would run that through the cost, you're not going to take it out separately. Sometimes you've taken it out and excluded it out of operating costs into other items.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>No, we don't plan to do that, Tanya. So what you described is how best to model it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you for that. And then, if I could just go back to Anita's question on just the second half performance with some of the mines that I think Cerro Negro would be evenly distributed, Ahafo and Mussel are going to get higher Q4. Is there any other operation that's going to have a higher Q4 because when I look at the numbers, you're looking at a production profile of Q4 being significantly stronger than Q3. Is that how I should think about it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right. Tanya, we're building towards a strong fourth quarter, you've got -- you'll have across some of the parts of the world in which we operate, you tend to get a bit more wet weather in the third quarter. So you typically see us have those drier locations that really bring it home in the fourth quarter. Pueblo Viejo ramping up with 40% of Pueblo Viejo, that's an important part of H2, Nevada Gold Mines guiding to a strong second half. That's an important part of our H2. Tanami, we have got pretty consistent tons through the mill in the second half, but we move into our highest grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So that's an important story. And I think we probably covered the -- most of the Merian certainly got a stronger second -- pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4. So I think we've covered the sort of the key drivers of H1 versus H2 and where the higher fourth quarter would come from.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. No, I appreciate that. Just when you look at the production profile, excluding Penasquito depending on what happens there, it is looking at the fourth quarter is the one that is going to carry quite a bit of weight for your -- in order to get your guidance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>That's right, Tanya. [Speech Overlap]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>And if I could just do one final question -- sorry?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Go forward, Tanya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Sorry, I cut you out to say something else. Just another follow-up on Greg's questions on the inflationary release that you were seeing. I just wanted to confirm because some companies are not seeing exactly the same thing. Would be also fair to say that you are seeing cyanide pricing coming down relative to what you have. And I just kind of wonder in your agreement, do we stock your inventories on these lower level prices that are out there. Some contracts -- some come up in three months, six months. I'm just wondering how -- when we are expecting you to renegotiate at these lower levels, so we can see when those would go through your cost structure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>So, Tanya, we -- our supply chain strategy, particularly with our key commodities is to have strategic contracts that are long-term based upon the size of our portfolio, and we built into those rise in full calculations. So, we pretty much then become a price taker but at a competitive price. And then, we -- and then we'll have flowed through the -- as you see, prices go up and down, we have some relief in terms of the volatility about price increases or price decreases. And then, with the inventories we have at sites, it takes a little while for that to flow through.</p><p>So, we are -- on the back of natural gas prices coming off, we are seeing ammonia prices down, caustic soda prices are also down and where we are seeing improvement in both cyanide cost and explosive costs. So that is flowing through and it's linked to click back to that key commodity price, and it's flowing through our contracts. It will wash through our inventories, and we just continue to -- through those contracts, take the prices as we have agreed in those contracts, and that then takes normally a month or two or three to flow through our inventories.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And so, those you could [Phonetic] see them coming in Q3 and into Q4?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, we'll see some of that benefit in Q3 and Q4, absolutely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tanya Jakusconek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thank you. I will get back in the queue. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Tanya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. The next question goes to Brian MacArthur of Raymond James. Brian, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning. Can I just follow up on Penasquito. Tanya covered the ongoing cost, but where is the concentrate situation? Is there concentrate in transit that's off-site that's provisionally priced and you're going to have some sales in Q3 if nothing happens? I was looking at your sales versus your production, and I know it varies quarter-by-quarter and lead versus zinc. Where are we on that? Is there actually a cash inflow to you from concentrator? Is it all stuck at site or where is that situation at the moment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Brian. So there's nothing left to put in all the sales being recognized in the second quarter. So there's nothing in the supply chain from the mine site to the smelters that hasn't been sold and recognized. And then, we have a small amount of concentrate stockpile on site but not much. Sites have [Phonetic] been put into care and maintenance in very good neck and everything is safe and secure onsite. So, the expectation that common sense prevails and we've got a workforce back at work, we can ramp up very quickly with a lot of experience in being able to ramp up from the pandemic days. So we know how to get that big mine back up and running and producing concentrate very quickly. So, it's pretty clean in terms of where we sit with the concentrates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thanks very much, Tom.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brian.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC Markets. Anita, please go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, a few more questions in terms of the details. At Tanami, could you just go over what you're looking for in terms of grades and tons in Q4, Q3?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>No problems, Tanya. The Q3...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Did I call you -- sorry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>I live in the flow. My apologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>And you called Tanya, Anita.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>I think I did. That's when Daniel was writing me notes. Tanya, if you're still listening, my apologies, and I needed my apologies. Obviously, I need a holiday. Sorry, I'm embarrassed. The high grades are in the fourth quarter. You'll actually see a little bit of a step up in the third quarter from what we were able to see in the second, and then we get into some nice high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So, pretty consistent through the mill and a step-up in the third and fourth quarter as they're free and clear of some of the disruption from the weather in the first half. So, you see a step-up in volumes through the mill, but the real grades flow in the fourth quarter. Nothing outrageous. Certainly well within the grades that we've seen historically.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And then, in terms of the project, I was noticing the spend at the different projects. And Tanami looks -- I mean, I don't really -- we don't really have sort of like the -- or maybe I've lost track of the amount of time that it's going to take to build out these projects. We are in the process like a percentage just from a time standpoint. But Ahafo North, it seems like the spend is not -- it's got the same start-up as Tanami expansion and I only see about 30% of the spend and where Tanami is about half the spend. So, could you just give us a little color on the time frames and the cadence of spending at both Tanami and Ahafo North?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tom Palmer:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I'll start off, Anita, and Rob might want to build on this. But Ahafo North has really been a first half or a quarter of just getting the work fronts opened up. So, a lot of clearing of land, bringing equipment in, and so gearing up with positioning ourselves to really get stuck into doing the pre-strip work and then the civil works will then start constructing the processing plant and other infrastructure. So, it's in a process of gearing up and then be able to accelerate up in terms of an open pit mine with a processing plant.</p><p>Tanami, where is probably -- we're in that serious process of stepping through the shaft, doing the concrete lining and then bringing in the various facilities that get attached to that concrete wall. So that's now starting to get a pretty steady state for that critical path item. The other thing that's largely -- the surface work in terms of most infrastructure is largely done. So clearly there's a whole bunch of winding equipment to install at the appropriate time on surface and not completely done. But at Tanami, we've got the underground excavation, it's all done, but you're really in that process now mobilizing those construction crews underground to start building out the conveyors and the crushers and all the supporting infrastructure for that. So, gearing up to get that work front really going ahead. So, quite different projects in terms of infrastructure underground, shaft lining and then building an open pit mine and the associated infrastructure.</p><p>Rob, anything you add on that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Anita, I would just emphasize what Tom said, a number of fronts that we're actively working on at Tanami is far larger than Ahafo North. So, every part of that project is getting worked on. And as Tom said, Ahafo North and seeing it just a month or so ago, the civil works is progressing very, very well. And in the coming months, that's when we will see significant spend, whether it be the contractors coming in, it's the steel getting erected, it's the hiring of cranes, it's the digging of tranches, etc, it's the construction of the tailings dams. So, as the next few months passes, the number of fronts that we start working on at Ahafo North significantly increases. And as such, we'll see that increase in spend as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>And then, in terms of that work, how much has been sort of like, I guess, committed or how much of that work in the next -- in the back half of this year and early next year, do you have a visibility on the cost level?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>In terms of, Anita...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>I guess I'm just trying to understand that if you haven't -- what I was trying to understand is, if you haven't really started getting into the guts of it, how certain are you that the capex guidance range is still good?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rob Atkinson:</emphasis></p><p>The key thing, which I'd certainly see, Anita, is that on the procurement side of things that we have basically secured just about all the supplies for both the projects, and I think that protects us enormously. The engineering that we've also done on both projects is at a significant level as well. So, we've got a large degree of confidence. The biggest thing is always is with shaft building. We progressed down there. And at the moment, we're aligning that very well. We've got patches of overbreak, which we'll deal with. But at the moment, because of the engineering, the procurement, we're still very much on track.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.</p><p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, NEWMONT CORPORATION: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team.</p><p>Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.</p><p>Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy.</p><p>And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond.</p><p>During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations.</p><p>There were 4 important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor.</p><p>At Newmont, Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important time for Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleon Gomez to cease this strike action and return their members to work.</p><p>The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at \u00c3\u2030l\u00c3\u00a9onore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance.</p><p>Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for 2 weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there.</p><p>And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower-grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months.</p><p>As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tons mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tons mined at Cerro Negro as the first wave of our district expansion comes online in the third quarter. Higher tons mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grade for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed in the Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our 2 non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance.</p><p>We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.</p><p>We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp 4 years ago as we build out our integration plans.</p><p>We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, backing the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years.</p><p>At Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business. It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability.</p><p>In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last 5 years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance. In particular, in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination.</p><p>I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.</p><p>ROBERT D. ATKINSON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; COO, NEWMONT CORPORATION: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with 5 additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.</p><p>Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter.</p><p>In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami.</p><p>Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months.</p><p>As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges.</p><p>At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter, and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year.</p><p>And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well. And with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year.</p><p>Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place \u00c3\u2030l\u00c3\u00a9onore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was and will always be the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis.</p><p>Moving to Porcupine. We delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the Pamour pit and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024.</p><p>At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase stope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift stope. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter.</p><p>And finally, Cripple Creek &amp; Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities.</p><p>And now moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance.</p><p>Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tons mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of 6 new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023.</p><p>Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito on June 7 as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito.</p><p>And now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our 2 non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.</p><p>KARYN OVELMEN, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, NEWMONT CORPORATION: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have.</p><p>Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success.</p><p>Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed my initial expectations.</p><p>Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle.</p><p>Turning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million. Cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables. We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years.</p><p>In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and merchants in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs.</p><p>Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items.</p><p>Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito since the strike commenced and at \u00c3\u2030l\u00c3\u00a9onore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires.</p><p>As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last 2 quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.</p><p>With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Thanks, Karyn. Over the last 2 months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood.</p><p>Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government.</p><p>Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister James Marape, Deputy Prime Minister John Russo and Mining Minister Sir Ano Pala. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project.</p><p>We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results.</p><p>With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And the first question today goes to Greg Barnes of TD Securities.</p><p>GREG BARNES, MD AND HEAD OF MINING RESEARCH, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: Tom, I just wanted to ask about inflationary pressures and how you see them evolving into the second half of '23 and '24 ex any volume improvements you're going to get, which obviously will help on a gold per ounce basis.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Yes. Thanks, Greg. What we're seeing in our direct cost is largely consistent with what we expected as we guided this year, and I just step through that in a little bit more detail. About half our cost base is labor, about 50% is labor made up pretty evenly between employees and contractors. Employees largely stable and expect that to remain largely stable through the rest of this year and into next. Certainly seeing some settling down in Australia, Canada, United States.</p><p>Contracted services also have stabilized. So still at a higher cost that we saw with the inflation coming through last year but largely stabilized, maybe a little bit of easing into the second half of this year, but certainly seeing the volatility come out of that, and that's at 50%, that's a pretty important driver.</p><p>30% materials and consumables. So it's the various reagents, particularly cyanide, explosive, steel for grinding media and the like. We're seeing those largely consistent with what we expected. Natural gas prices have come off, which is then flowing through to the prices that we're seeing for both cyanide and explosives. So a little bit of relief tailwinds with those consumables and would expect that to flow through the second half of this year. We'll see supply of natural gas may be tighten a bit, which may put a bit more tension on those prices, but certainly expecting to see that stable or a little bit of an improvement and still pretty much holding its own as we look at the grinding [median to] remove around the place.</p><p>And then the next big category is fuel and energy, 15%, and that's driven by diesel. And we've certainly seen some relief in oil prices relative to what we've assumed. And we would expect to see that carry on through the second half of this year, but a volatile commodity and one that we'll continue to be conservative as we think about our assumptions for that. So a few tailwinds, Greg, some stability and consistent with what we expected for 2023.</p><p>GREG BARNES: Great. That's very helpful, Tom. And just a follow-on. In the presentation, you talked about the guidance you're going to provide in February. I'm just wondering how detailed do you expect to be in February around Newcrest and your expectations for how that's going to fold into the company in '24?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: We're certainly working towards being in a position where we can give you a view of 2024 for the combined portfolio, which would include our view of the 5 Newcrest assets being folded into our operations. So if things continue to go to plan in terms of regulatory approvals, shareholder votes and close, integration planning busily being done. We'll receive the keys to the car so to speak in early November, I would hope, and that gives us time to work through those mine plans, apply the Newmont lens on those mine plans and the assumptions we make for some of the key input assumptions and certainly working towards being in a position to provide the 2024 guidance for the combined portfolio in the February time frame.</p><p>GREG BARNES: And what about the 3- to 5-year guidance beyond that, will that wait?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: We will monitor that. And see how those numbers come together. We'll certainly be looking in the 2024 time frame to provide as much information as we think appropriate, certainly for 2024 in that February time frame and then -- and look for a logical time for a Capital Markets Day to share some more information on the combined portfolio and maybe even look to try and include some sort of site visit with that. So that's still work in progress, Greg. But certainly, 2024 is in our side for that February timeframe.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our next question goes to Anita Soni of CIBC Markets.</p><p>ANITA SONI, RESEARCH ANALYST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question with regards to the transaction, could you tell me, did the independent adviser or the independent expert for Newcrest reach that conclusion yet?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Anita, thank you for dialing in. I think that might be a little vacation period for you. So good to hear your voice, and hopefully, you can get off this call and back to some better years of time.</p><p>They're still working through that process. So that's their working -- it's in train working through, but not finished yet. So it's -- but it's on schedule in terms of when we need that information in order to be able to proceed for the time line we had in the deck.</p><p>ANITA SONI: Okay. And then the second question, and then I'll go back into the queue. I'm just trying to get some of the grades that Rob quickly went through in terms of -- so let's start with Musselwhite. I think they said 30% improvement in tons mined and then grades by 40%. Is that a Q3 or Q4? If I do that in Q3, I get well above your guide.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: We're certainly starting to see a step-up in grade in both Q3 and Q4, pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4 for Musselwhite, Anita. We're opening up with a nice double lift stope coming on, which is going to give us both some improvement in grade and volume. And then we've got some stopes and some high-grade material also coming on as a result of the work in the first half. So pretty consistent grade, Rob, through the second half and certainly seeing a step-up in volume coming out. That will ramp up over the third and fourth quarter. So the highest volume through the mill in the fourth quarter rate pretty consistent.</p><p>ANITA SONI: Okay. And then just in terms of -- I think at Ahafo where you were talking -- or maybe it was Akyem, 35% uptick in grades in Q3. Is that correct?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's right, Anita. So in Akyem, we stepped out into stockpiles, got the -- I mean, if those of you who know Akyem, it's a long narrow pit and so is where as we're getting the last of the ore from the bottom of the pit and the current layback and wanting to bring down the next layback, we want to make sure that we maximize that also. We stepped out of the pit, made sure catch benches and the like rolling good shape. And swung into the stock -- the stockpiles we would have been in, in the fourth quarter. And now we're back in that ore. And so we basically got right of mine high-grade ore from the bottom of the pit coming through. You'll see most of that through the -- now you see a good portion of that through the build through the third and fourth quarter now. It's the highest grades in the fourth quarter, building up through the third.</p><p>ANITA SONI: Okay. And then lastly, at Cerro Negro. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So 30% increase in tons mined and 50% increase in grade. But I don't think Rob said which quarter it was. Is that -- does that start in Q3? Or is it Q4 weighted?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: We see the step-up in grade at Cerro Negro pretty consistent through the third and fourth quarter at Cerro Negro. And then you'll actually see -- you see quite a step-up in tons mined as we've got more ability to access ore particularly as we start to extract ore from San Marcos for the first time. So pretty consistent second half across Q3 and Q4 in terms of material coming through the mill and the grades looking pretty consistent through those 2 quarters.</p><p>Anita, probably one other on Ahafo. We've got the -- we've got the stars really lining up in terms of the real sweet spot in the Subika open pit as well as now having the third level of Subika underground open more than 20 draw points open. So we've got both the combination of high grades and tons coming out of open pit and underground at Ahafo. So it's another important one to be thinking about as you think about second half of the year. But that's certainly fourth quarter weighted as that comes through building through the third or the fourth quarter is a strong one at Ahafo with the stars lining up in both open pit and underground with mine sequences.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question goes to Mike Parkin of National Bank.</p><p>MICHAEL PARKIN, MINING ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you just give a bit more color in terms of the background on pausing at Cerro Negro in mining? And does it have with what you've kind of investigated and decided on a go-forward basis? Does it have any material impact on the cost structure of that asset going forward?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Mike, certainly, absolutely no impact on cost structure going forward. It was from time to time, certainly, my experience and Rob's experience you'll get an event, and we had a significant potential event in the underground mine and involved a loader that we weren't happy that we had the control environment in to be managing as the standard that we'd expect around -- basically, it was a piece of equipment involved in an incident. It's a remote mine.</p><p>As you know, Cerro Negro is in a very remote part of Argentina and Patagonia. And we wanted to ensure that the standards that we expect, we're clear across the 4 crews that were there and that we went through the underground mine and did the appropriate inspections to make sure that equipment and conditions underground were well understood. You're obviously working underground in a remote location. So it's briefly important that we can be satisfied that the expectations are well understood and the conditions underground are well understood.</p><p>We're also entering into a second half, which is a step-up in both grade and tons. So we're moving into a period of time where we're going to be asking the team to step up and be working more fronts. So we took the time to ensure that conditions were clear and expectations were set. There's nothing in terms of additional cost base. It's more about just ensuring that the leaders at all levels and their mining teams are understanding the standards that we expect and that we can confidently move forward with mining what will be a strong second half at Cerro Negro.</p><p>MICHAEL PARKIN: Okay. Great. So pretty much to sum up, it's more kind of ensuring operational best practices of Newmont being executed at that site.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's right, Mike. We will do that from time to time, in my experience there are times when you must always maintain a chronic needs with safety, and there will be events that come from time to time and part of maintaining solid safety performance is recognizing when you may need to just pause and ensure everyone's got their mind on the game, understand what's expected and then move forward with confidence. And so that's something we do from time to time. Certainly, Cerro Negro we cited that this needed a couple of weeks down.</p><p>I'd expect as we do our integration planning for Newcrest and think about 5 new operations coming into our portfolio, think about the work we might do through November and December. That's certainly one of the debates we're having in terms of how do we ensure that the standards that we expect at Newmont are there in place in Day 1 of those new crystal operations. So it's something that certainly both Rob and I have done in our careers from time to time when we see a need to reset expectations.</p><p>MICHAEL PARKIN: Okay. Excellent. And just one question on Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito. With respect to the stream, is there any minimum delivery of silver that you're tied to? Or are you fully free to shut down and not deliver silver when you're not producing?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's correct. That's my understanding, Mike, we'll get the team to just run that to ground. And it's different from that, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question goes to Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK, SENIOR GOLD RESEARCH ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: I wanted to ask about Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito, just to get some clarification just from so many news articles that keep coming out. I'm just trying to understand with the union being on June 8, I just want to make sure that I understood some of the articles that came out. Has the union gone to paying the workers? Because my understanding was the workers aren't being paid being on strike, that the union has gone in to pay the workers. Do we know if that's a correct statement from some of the papers I was reading?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Tanya, that's correct. The members, the union members who are on strike are not being paid by the union that they're members of. And as part of our position at the negotiating table, we're not paying back pay.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. So the union is not paying and you're not paying. So they haven't been paid since June 8.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's right. So workforce of some 2,000 people aren't being paid. You've got a much bigger contractor workforce that aren't being paid. You've got an extended community. There's some 28,000 people that rely upon those wages to see some benefits. They're not being paid. We're the biggest taxpayer in the state of Zacatecas. They're not getting taxes. And our contributions are close to $2 billion a year to the Mexican government through both taxes and royalties are not currently being paid. So our message to the union leadership is we have a fair and equitable agreement. We paid in accordance with that, and we strongly encourage them to get their members back to work so that we can start paying wages again.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. Yes, it's just there was an article, Tom, that's saying that the union leader -- the union was taking money from their coffers and paying the workers. I just wanted to clarify that.</p><p>And just how should we think about the cost of the -- on a monthly basis, being on care and maintenance as we go into July, how should I think, number one, what sort of cost should I be thinking about you incurring on care and maintenance? And number two, would that be coming through the operating costs? Or would you take that out and put it under other?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Yes. So we -- you'll see -- and I'll get Daniel to catch up with you after the call, but we've got something in our earnings release. If you think about those costs through the month of June, at Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito, we incurred $23 million of operating costs, another $15 million in depreciation due to the suspension of operations. So it's down for most of June. That's...</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Is it out of operating costs into other items?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: No, we don't plan to do that, Tanya. So what you described is how best to model it.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. And then if I could just go back to Anita's question on just the second half performance with some of the mines that I think Cerro Negro would be evenly distributed Ahafo and Mussel are going to get higher Q4. Is there any other operation that going to have a higher Q4 because when I look at the numbers, you're looking at a production profile of Q4 being significantly stronger than Q3. Is that how I should think about it?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's right, Tanya. We're building towards a strong fourth quarter. You've got -- you'll have across some of the parts of the world in which we operate, you tend to get a bit more wet weather in the third quarter. So you typically see us have those drier locations that really bring it home in the fourth quarter. Pueblo Viejo ramping up with 40% of Pueblo Viejo. That's an important part of H2, Nevada Gold Mines guiding to a strong second half. That's an important part of our H2. Tanami, we have got pretty consistent tons through the mill in the second half, but we move into our highest grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So that's an important story. And I think we probably covered the -- most of the Merian certainly got a stronger second pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4. So I think we've covered the sort of the key drivers of H1 versus H2 and where the higher fourth quarter would come from.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. No, I appreciate that. It's just when you look at the production profile, excluding Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito depending on what happens there, it is looking at the fourth quarter is the one that is going to carry quite a bit of weight for your -- in order to get your guidance.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: That's right, Tanya.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: If I could just do one final question. Sorry?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Go ahead, Tanya.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. Sorry, I cut you to say something else. Just another follow-up on Greg's questions on the inflationary release that you are seeing. I just wanted to confirm because some companies are not seeing exactly the same thing. Would be also fair to say that you are seeing cyanide pricing coming down relative to what you have. And I just kind of wonder in your agreement to restock your inventories on these lower level prices that are out there. Some contracts for some come up in 3 months, 6 months. I'm just wondering how -- when we are expecting you to renegotiate at these lower levels, so we can see when those would go through your cost structure.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: So Tanya, we -- our supply chain strategy, particularly with our key commodities is to have strategic contracts that are long term based upon the size of our portfolio, and we built into those rise in full calculations. So we pretty much then become a price taker but at a competitive price. And then we -- and then we'll have flowed through the -- as you see prices go up and down, we have some relief in terms of the volatility about price increases or price decreases. And then with the inventories we have at sites, and it takes a little while for that to flow through.</p><p>So we are -- on the back of natural gas prices coming off, we are seeing ammonia prices down, caustic soda prices are also down and where we are seeing improvement in both cyanide cost and explosive costs. So that is flowing through and it's linked to click back to that key commodity price, and it's flowing through our contracts. It will wash through our inventories, and we just continue to, through those contracts, take the prices as we have agreed in those contracts, and that then takes normally a month or 2 or 3 to flow through our inventories.</p><p>TANYA M. JAKUSCONEK: Okay. And so those you could see them coming in, in Q3 and into Q4?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Yes, yes, we'll see some of that benefit in Q3 and Q4, absolutely.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question goes to Brian MacArthur of Raymond James.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR, MD &amp; HEAD OF MINING RESEARCH, RAYMOND JAMES LTD., RESEARCH DIVISION: Can I just follow up on Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito. Tanya covered the ongoing cost, but where is the concentrate situation? Is there concentrate in transit that's off-site that's provisionally priced and you're going to have some sales in Q3 if nothing happens or I was looking at your sales versus your production, and I know it varies quarter-by-quarter and lead versus zinc. Where are we on that? Is there actually a cash inflow to you from concentrator? Is it all stuck at side? Or where is that situation at the moment?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Brian, so there's nothing left to put and all the sales being recognized in the second quarter. So there's nothing in the supply chain from the mine site to the smelters that hasn't been sold and recognized. And then we have a small amount of concentrate stockpile on site but not much. Sites been put into care and maintenance in very good neck and everything is safe and secure onsite. So the expectation that common sense prevails and we've got a workforce back at work. We can ramp up very quickly with a lot of experience in being able to ramp up from the pandemic days. So we know how to get that big mine back up and running and producing concentrate very quickly. So it's pretty clean in terms of where we sit with the concentrates.</p><p>OPERATOR: We have a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC Markets.</p><p>ANITA SONI: So a few more questions in terms of the details. At Tanami, could you just go over what you're looking for in terms of grades and tons in the Q4, Q3?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: No problems, Tanya. The Q3...</p><p>ANITA SONI: Anita.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Sorry. Sorry. That lives in the flow. Anita, yes. Daniel was writing me notes, Tanya, if you're still listening, my apologies, and I needed my apologies. Obviously, I need a holiday, sorry. The high grades are in the fourth quarter. You'll actually see a little bit of a step up in the third quarter from what we are able to see in the second -- and then we get into some nice high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So pretty consistent through the mill and a step-up in the third and fourth quarter as they're free and clear of some of the disruption from the weather in the first half. So you see a step-up in volumes through the mill but the real grades flow in the fourth quarter. Nothing outrageous. Certainly well within the grades that we've seen historically.</p><p>ANITA SONI: Okay. And then in terms of the project, I was noticing the spend at the different projects. And Tanami looks -- I mean I don't really -- we don't really have sort of like the -- or maybe I've lost track of the amount of time that it's going to take to build out these projects, we are in the process like a percentage just from a time standpoint. But Ahafo North, it seems like the spend is not -- it's got the same start-up at Tanami expansion and I only see about 30% of the spend and where Tanami's about has to spend. So could you just give us a little color on the time frame and the cadence of spending at both Tanami and Ahafo North?</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Sure. I'll start off Anita and Rob might want to build on this. But Ahafo North has really been a first half or a quarter of just getting the work fronts opened up. So a lot of clearing of land, bringing equipment in. And so gearing up with positioning ourselves to really get stuck into doing the pre-strip work and then the civil works will then start constructing the process plant and other infrastructure. So it's in a process of gearing up and then be able to accelerate up in terms of an open pit mine with a processing plant. Tanami, where is probably -- we're in that serious process of stepping through the shaft, doing those -- doing the concrete line and then bringing in the various facilities that get attached to that concrete wall. So that's in now starting to get a pretty steady state for that critical path item.</p><p>The other thing that's largely the surface work in terms of most infrastructure is largely done. So clearly, there's a whole bunch of winding equipment to install at the appropriate time on surface and not completely done. But at Tanami, we've got the underground excavation, it's all done, but you're really in that process now mobilizing those construction crews underground to start building out the conveyors and the crushers and all the supporting infrastructure for that.</p><p>So gearing up to get that work front really going ahead. So quite different projects in terms of infrastructure underground, shaft lining and then building an open pit mine and the associated infrastructure.</p><p>Rob, anything you add on that?</p><p>ROBERT D. ATKINSON: Anita, I would just emphasize what Tom said, a number of fronts that we're actively working on at Tanami is far larger than Ahafo North. So every part of that project is getting worked on. And as Tom said, Ahafo North and seeing it just a month or so ago, the civil works is progressing very, very well. And in the coming months, that's when we will see significant spend, whether it be the contractors coming in. It's the steel getting erected. It's the hiring of cranes, it's the digging of tranches, et cetera, it's the construction of the tailings dams.</p><p>So as the next few months passes, the number of fronts that we start working on at Ahafo North significantly increases. And as such, we'll see that increase in spend as well.</p><p>ANITA SONI: And then in terms of that work, how much has been sort of like, I guess, committed or how much of that work in the next -- in the back half of this year and early next year, do you have a visibility on the cost level?</p><p>ROBERT D. ATKINSON: In terms of, Anita...</p><p>ANITA SONI: I guess I'm just trying to understand that if you haven't -- what I was trying to understand is if you haven't really started getting into the guts of it, how certain are you that the CapEx guidance range is still good?</p><p>ROBERT D. ATKINSON: The key thing, which I'd certainly see, Anita, is that on the procurement side of things that we have basically secured just about all the supplies for both the projects. And I think that protects us enormously. The engineering that we've also done on both projects is at a significant level as well. So we've got a large degree of confidence.</p><p>The biggest thing is always is with shaft building. We progressed down there. And at the moment, we're aligning that very well. We've got patches of overbreak, which we'll deal with. But at the moment, because of the engineering, the procurement, we're still very much on track.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.</p><p>THOMAS RONALD PALMER: Thanks, operator. Just a quick one for Mike Parkin's question. Just confirm there's no minimum payment on the silver stream, Mike, if you're still listing on the call.</p><p>Thank you all for making the time for the call this quarter, and please enjoy the rest of your day, and thank you for your time. Thanks, everyone.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

The Georgia grand jury's findings have been presented, to the Fulton County Judge, in the Trump election case. \"I'm anxious to see the indictment,\" says Geoff Duncan, (R) former Georgia Lieutenant Governor, amid GA grand jury returning 10 indictments, and awaiting unsealing.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[21:00:00]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROBERT MCBURNEY, SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE AT FULTON COUNTY GOVERNMENT: One second. Just making sure (inaudible).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Royals (ph), everything went, as it should have, in front of the grand jury?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, sir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCBURNEY: All right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms. Alexandria (ph), you're prepared to take this? And I guess I'm delivering it to the clerk. You'll maintain custody of it from here?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, sir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCBURNEY: All right. This one's for you.</p><p>Can you take the certification? Or does it go with Madam Clerk (ph)? All right. Thank you all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you.</p><p>MCBURNEY: Yes, you too.</p><p>Want you (ph) guys make way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stand back, please.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: So, Elie Honig, she's now bringing that document, which the judge has now looked at, to the clerk?</p><p>ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Correct, Anderson. And what we just saw was the judge reviewing that indictment.</p><p>And to be clear, that is not a substantive review. That indictment appeared to be quite long. The judge does not read through it, and have to sign off on it. That's the grand jury's province. That's already happened.</p><p>The judge is just making sure that there's no procedural irregularities. That's why you heard that quick questioning. \"Did everything go as expected in the grand jury room, or were there any problems?\" And the individual said, \"No problems.\"</p><p>So, now it's being sent to the clerk's office, where the next step is it will be docketed, meaning it will become part of the official record. It will be available to all of us, in the public and the media, assuming it's not under seal. All indications are here that it's not going to be under seal. And if that's the case, if it's not sealed, then we will have access to that document momentarily.</p><p>COOPER: And Michael Moore, this is how it always occurs in courts, in Georgia, at this level?</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes, that was a pretty standard return of an indictment in court.</p><p>I mean, frankly, you usually see this about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and the prosecutor comes in, and there's a stack of indictments, and they range everything from carjackings, to drug cases, to sometimes, child support, you just never know what may be in there. And then, there's a stack that is returned into court.</p><p>In this case, obviously, the grand jury was doing a pretty targeted session. And they obviously considered the allegations. We'll see how many defendants they indicted. By all accounts, we're expecting a dozen or so, which now sets the stage for the battle. And so, this is the beginning of the race, from the prosecutor's standpoint. Getting the indictment is fairly simple. You know that from seeing this grand jury meet today.</p><p>And so now, we'll be offered -- we'll see a flurry of pretrial motions, after we see if those tasked (ph) with the former President, or whoever is charged, to come in, and has to appear before the court. There'll be a question of some bond and how that works. And by all accounts, there'll be no real issue with that. It'll just be a formality.</p><p>And then, it's off to the races, for everybody, from the prosecutor, to the defense attorneys, and ultimate to the appellate courts.</p><p>COOPER: And, Michael, in terms of the grand jury, how long has this particular grand jury -- I mean, Fani Willis has been doing this investigation, for more than two years. How long has this grand jury been focused on it? And at what stage does she present the charges that she wants to the grand jury?</p><p>MOORE: Yes, there have been a couple of grand juries meeting in the recent weeks. And so, I don't know how long this particular one has actually had their hands, on the indictment, and have been presented with the evidence. You can receive evidence, from other grand juries.</p><p>The former grand jury, the Special Purpose Grand Jury, which met for about eight months, remember, did not have the power, to return an indictment. That grand jury just simply had the power to investigate, to issue subpoenas, to look at the evidence, to have the witnesses come before them.</p><p>A grand jury in Georgia, a regular criminal grand jury, does not have investigative powers. Typically, that grand jury has to be confronted and presented, what we call laying the indictment on the table. And that is that -- there's the prosecutor comes in and says, \"We intend to seek an indictment for charges A through Z. And we want to present evidence about that.\"</p><p>And then, there'll be an introduction of some prosecution witness. It can be done by summary witnesses. It's oftentimes done by some investigator, some law enforcement official, who comes in. And of course, the grand jury has a chance, then, to ask questions about the indictment, but is not investigating.</p><p>So the accurate return or the decision, by a grand jury, to criminal process to give an indictment can be fairly quick. And, I think, here you can tell, we had eight months of investigation and, really, a relatively short time of consideration, for the return of the indictment.</p><p>COOPER: And Elie, just do you have a sense of, from now that it's heading to the clerk, what is the process, for it being released?</p><p>[21:05:00]</p><p>HONIG: So, the clerk, really, at this point just, has to add it to the docket. They'll open up a new docket entry, which is all online now. It'll be titled State of Georgia versus whoever the defendants are. And then, presumably the indictment will be docketed. There won't be typically some sort of formal announcement, by a clerk.</p><p>Now, the D.A., Fani Willis, may choose to come down, and make an announcement, at any moment. In fact, prosecutors tend to do things that way. As soon as the document hits the docket and becomes public, the D.A. will want to come down and make a basic statement, to inform us of what's in there.</p><p>But there's not going to be a judge taking the bench again, in the ordinary course, to say that this indictment has come back.</p><p>So, it does look like the documents that were signed, reviewed quickly, and properly, by the judge, and sent back to the clerk, had been walked back into the clerk's area. And that does look like the clerk's office that we're seeing, right now. And so, now it's just a question of, really, the sort of formality, of docketing it, and making this document official, and available to the public.</p><p>COOPER: And Kaitlan Collins, I mean, this is something that the team, around the former President, has been expecting, certainly on this night.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: Yes, he has two different attorneys, than most people would probably recognize representing him, specifically in Georgia. I mean, there are so many different indictments that he kind of has a different legal team, for each of them.</p><p>And we're waiting to see what they're hearing, themselves. I mean, we're watching this process happen, as the paperwork is being delivered, to the judge, those findings there. We don't actually have confirmation that it was the indictment we believe it was.</p><p>But Trump's team is waiting, just as we are. I mean, they kind of have an expectation of what to do, once he is informed that he is indicted, if that is what happens here. They certainly believe that he is going to be one of those names, potentially indicted. But his legal team has obviously, just been watching this as closely as anyone else has, as we are, to see when this actually happens, when they are actually notified of it.</p><p>I will say one thing that I do believe is going to be different here. Beyond the fact that we were just able to watch that moment there, which in and of itself, we have not seen with the other indictments, is that we do believe there's an expectation, we would likely hear, from the District Attorney here. That is the same District Attorney that Trump has been attacking.</p><p>And what I have heard is from seeing these other indictments happen, where Trump has kind of been the first person, to come out and present his side of it? It seems like that time span is getting shorter and shorter with each indictment. And instead, we are hearing from the prosecutors, earlier on. We certainly did with Jack Smith, in the last indictment.</p><p>There is certainly a potential that we would hear something, from Fani Willis, here, someone who I should note, in recent days, had to email her staff and say, \"Ignore the attacks, focus on the work, keep your head down,\" because there have been these persistent and repeated attacks, from Trump.</p><p>But as for his team itself, and how they're preparing for this, I mean, this isn't their first indictment, and they were expecting this. And so, they do have surrogates and allies ready to go.</p><p>But I do think it is notable that his legal troubles are certainly piling up. I'm told it's something that is very clear, when you're around Trump, and his inner circle. He's been out in public recently, at Iowa, at the LIV Golf tournament that he had, at his course. But so many people around him are --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Hey, Kaitlan. I'm sorry. I just have to interrupt. I got to go to Sara Murray.</p><p>Sara, what's happening?</p><p>SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: So, we are learning that the grand jury has returned multiple indictments. We're learning that there were 10 indictments. Again, this is based on the paperwork that has been returned, and has made its way, into the clerk's office.</p><p>We are still waiting for the official release of these indictments. And we're still waiting, essentially, for the names, who are unnamed here.</p><p>We know obviously, that Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, went into this, intending to seek charges, against former President Donald Trump, and a number of his allies. We don't yet know, who is named, in these indictments, what the details are, of these indictments. But we do know, from the paperwork that the grand jury returned 10 indictments, guys.</p><p>COOPER: And do you have a sense of when we will get more details? Will those come anything from Fani Willis, if she chooses to speak tonight, as would make perhaps seem likely? Or will that be will more become clearer, as the document is seen online?</p><p>MURRAY: Well, I think two things need to happen. I mean, first of all, these indictments need to be processed. They need to be stamped, by the clerk, potentially, in order, for Fani Willis, to speak freely, about what the grand jury has actually returned today. And it's a little unclear how long that will take.</p><p>Again, we're past 9 PM. So, we're well past when most of the clerk's office staff would be here, to assist them, in processing that. So, we don't know exactly how long it's going to take for these full indictments to be made public. And then, it's possible that we could hear remarks, from Fani Willis, on this case.</p><p>Again, she spent two-and-a-half years investigating this. This is clearly something that they felt like they could do, in one day, before the grand jury. And they obviously got some bang for their buck, today, because the grand jury approved 10 indictments. And now, we're sort of waiting to see what the timing is going to be like for us to actually see the meat of what is in those.</p><p>COOPER: Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, what do you make? 10 indictments, what do you read into that?</p><p>[21:10:00]</p><p>HONIG: Important piece of news there, Anderson, because anytime you have a case, with multiple defendants, like this one, there's a key strategic decision, you have to make, as a prosecutor, which is are we going to indict everyone, all together, on one indictment? Or are we going to break it up either into individual indictments or smaller groups? And the fact that we are now hearing that it's 10 different indictments, tells me they've gone, for the latter approach.</p><p>One of the strategic benefits of sort of stripping out your defendants into individual or separate indictments, is it does enable you to get any one of those indictments, to trial, more quickly. Because, if you have 10 people together, on one indictment, that's a huge undertaking, that's going to take quite a while to get to trial.</p><p>If you have one person charged individually, that's much quicker, to get to trial. So, I think there's a streamlining consideration, happening here.</p><p>COOPER: So, 10 indictments, does that mean 10 individuals, or could there be multiple indictments per individual?</p><p>HONIG: So, the way I understand that is there are 10 separate charging instruments, 10 separate documents. You could see one person, in each indictment. You could see two, three, four people, in each indictment.</p><p>But the way I understand Sara's reporting, if there's 10 different indictments, that means you have a minimum of 10 people. But you could have more. You could have, for example, one indictment, with one person, another one with three. They might have chopped it up into sort of substantive blocks here.</p><p>Could you see multiple -- the same person, charged in more than one of those indictments? Yes, theoretically. But that would be a very confusing way to charge this. I don't expect that's how the D.A. has done it.</p><p>COOPER: Hey, Charlie (ph), would you just repeat that, please?</p><p>I'm told the paperwork indicates that the grand jury did not vote against any of the indictments, presented to it, on Monday.</p><p>HONIG: OK.</p><p>So, that's as expected, Anderson. In other words, the grand jury will either vote yes or no, on each indictment, by a majority vote. That's all that's required, in the grand jury, 12 out of 23.</p><p>And to build off that reporting, that tells us that the grand jury voted yes, on all of the indictments that were presented to it. Sometimes very rarely, but sometimes a grand jury will vote what we call no true bill, meaning, \"We are not indicting.\"</p><p>But it sounds like the reporting that you just repeated is that the grand jury voted yes, to indict everyone, who was presented to it.</p><p>COOPER: Yes. We're joined now by Jake Tapper, in Washington. Let's go to him.</p><p>Jake?</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Thanks, Anderson. Appreciate it.</p><p>So, I am here with my panel, which includes Abby Phillip, Gloria Borger, Jamie Gangel, Laura Coates, and Andy McCabe.</p><p>And, right now, let's start with the Legal Analyst, we have, on the panel.</p><p>Right now, we're waiting to hear who got indicted. Is it your assumption that these are 10 indictments, for 10 different individuals? Or are you not going to say? You don't know?</p><p>LAURA COATES, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it's not entirely clear. But if it was, let's play both out. If it is 10 different individuals, then you're going to have 10 separate potential trials, which of course means that you're going to have issues with the efficiency.</p><p>If the underlying factual predicate for everything, means that it could all be tried together, you're going to have delays that otherwise would not be there. If it's all together, you have the delay, of every single duck, trying to get in a row. And every different defense attorney assigned each particular person, trying to figure out, who getting advantage and who does not.</p><p>What's so significant here, though, is the way this has happened. People have expected this, for quite some time. The fact that it's taken place, in a day, might confuse some people, towards the voting.</p><p>What happens is a presentation of a closing argument, if you will. As the prosecutor, you go in, and you say, \"Here's all the evidence I have before you.\" You essentially say to them, \"Here are the potential charges I'd like you to consider.\" You're going to line up the facts, the data, the testimony that you've already come in, and you're going to align it next to each individual element of a particular crime.</p><p>And you're going to say to them, \"I'd like you to vote on these charges.\" And you do it in such a concise and methodical way, as to leave no room for error that they can have a finding of probable cause. That's all this is. It is not beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>But it is very difficult to have the breadth of information, over multi years, to have a grand jury, who has been meeting, for months and months, if not longer, to try to keep their own individual notebooks of everything. You're going to present it to the jury. And you're going to say, \"Here's what I'm asking for you to do.\"</p><p>The fact that there was not a single indictment that was voted against, leads me to believe that there was substantial evidence, to support the probable cause finding. It was done in a clear and compelling way. They had the proverbial horse's mouths, to actually testify to different things.</p><p>And this is, of course, not in a vacuum, is it? Georgia and the magnifying glass over Georgia has been there, for quite a long time.</p><p>TAPPER: Well, and a lot of this just played out, in front of the cameras, or by the press, for example.</p><p>COATES: It is, yes.</p><p>TAPPER: What I would imagine, Jamie Gangel, is one of the main exhibits, is the complete audio tape, of Trump, calling the Secretary of State, and telling him to find, I think, it's 11,780 votes. I think that's the number. Is it?</p><p>COATES: Yes.</p><p>JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: That is correct.</p><p>TAPPER: OK, thank you so much.</p><p>GANGEL: And most important, only one more --</p><p>TAPPER: One more than was needed.</p><p>GANGEL: -- than he needed.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Correct.</p><p>[21:15:00]</p><p>TAPPER: But that's something that we learned, because somebody, in Raffensperger's office, presumably, gave the recording, to the Washington Post. And we learned that almost two years ago.</p><p>GANGEL: And every time we hear that recording, it's as if it's the first time again.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes, it's shocking, every time.</p><p>GANGEL: I mean it is stunning.</p><p>Look, to Laura's point about we expected this? I think it was about a week or 10 days ago that Fani Willis said \"We're ready to go.\" Clearly, she was ready to go.</p><p>We don't know all the names of the people, who were indicted. But certainly, Donald Trump, and people around him think he is one of the people.</p><p>Look, in addition to that recording, I just think it's worth knowing that reminding people that Georgia, there were -- Donald Trump, and his allies, put pressure, on a lot of States.</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>GANGEL: But nowhere, the way he did in Georgia.</p><p>And when you look at the evidence, we're told, there're the recordings, texts, emails, documents, and there're the false electors. What don't we know yet? We don't know who cooperated.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>GANGEL: We don't know whether Mark Meadows or others cooperated.</p><p>TAPPER: Let's go to the Fulton County Courthouse, right now, if we can, just to check in, with our reporter, on the ground, there, Sara Murray.</p><p>Sara, do we have any idea, when we're actually going to see these indictments?</p><p>MURRAY: Well, Jake, we're waiting to see.</p><p>We're told, from our colleagues, who are in the clerk's office, right now, that again, the clerk has confirmed that the grand jury returned 10 indictments, would not say who was indicted. And when asked, about the timeline, for getting copies of this indictment, said worst-case scenario, three hours.</p><p>So, we're hoping that truly is the worst-case scenario that we're not waiting here for three hours, to see the guts, of what is in this indictment. And they can move a little speedily than that.</p><p>I think my sense is the District Attorney's Office would certainly like to move quicker than this being made public, in the next three hours.</p><p>But again, it takes a little bit for them to actually be able to process this document, to stamp it. It's clear they do want to be able to make it widely public. But it's not clear, at this point, how long that's going to take.</p><p>TAPPER: Right, although they are working through the night, right? I mean, that was one of the things that was interesting about this evening is that normally the grand jury, at 5 o'clock, like the whistle, at the beginning of the Flintstones, they run out -- that's an old-dated reference. I apologize for the younger viewers.</p><p>But the idea that the workday is done at 5 o'clock and you go home. But today, they did not do that. And that was unusual, right?</p><p>MURRAY: Oh, that was absolutely unusual. I mean, we've been, at this courthouse, I can't tell you how many times, and it's a no man's land, when you get past 5 o'clock. Not only, have the judges just left for the day, but the clerk and the clerk's staff has left for the day. This was a very clearly concerted effort, to keep staff around, in order to be able to do this, this evening.</p><p>Judge Robert McBurney, who is the presiding judge, this week, gave reporters, who spent all day, in his courtroom, a number of updates, essentially saying, \"I'm still sticking around. The courthouse closes at 5. I'm still going to be here.\"</p><p>It was very clear in the clerk's office that while a number of people were leaving today that there was still some staff that was staying behind, in anticipation, of the grand jury, handing up these indictments. So, this is a very different feel, and certainly a very different timeline, from what we're used to seeing out of this courthouse.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Sara Murray, you let us know when to come back to you.</p><p>Let's continue with my panel.</p><p>I want to go to Andy McCabe, if I can, just because you're somebody, who is more familiar, with the grand jury process than all of us, except for Laura Coates, of course.</p><p>What are you thinking, right now? Do you think these are 10 indictments of 10 different people, or 10 indictments of one person? Or you're not going to guess?</p><p>ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: It's tough to make a guess. I think it's --</p><p>TAPPER: OK. MCCABE: -- I think it's -- and I wouldn't rule out seeing some indictments with multiple folks on them. So if, for instance, a particular activity, let's say the fake electors, is condensed into one indictment, and you have multiple fake electors, all --</p><p>TAPPER: Oh, so it might be 10 indictments for -- the number is the crimes?</p><p>MCCABE: You could organize them by content. You could organize them by individual. If you have three individuals, who are involved in the exact same conduct, it would make sense, to put them together on for instance, on one indictment. So, I don't think we can automatically assume it's exactly 10 people, at this point.</p><p>BORGER: Yes, we've been told that nearly 20 people were informed that they could face some kind of charges. So, that's 20, there.</p><p>And then, we also know, for example, there was this meeting, of these pro-Trump Republicans, 16 of them, who had this discussion, about casting the fake electoral votes, for him. So, that's 16 people, there.</p><p>[21:20:00]</p><p>So, false statements made by the President, the former President's lawyers, of which there are many. So again, it's hard to kind of guess how this was organized. It's like writing a story, which is the --</p><p>PHILLIP: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: -- which is the best way to organize the story. We know the lead. But kind of which is the best way to make it clearer to people that there are multiple charges that perhaps multiple people participated in?</p><p>PHILLIP: And this is with all of these indictments, the most important part for the public, which is what kind of story, to your point, do they actually tell?</p><p>In Georgia, as Jamie was saying, this was probably the State, where there was the most concerted effort, at all levels of government, from the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, all the way down to individual election workers, who were targeted, with intimidation. And --</p><p>TAPPER: It was the slimmest margin of victory also, is it not?</p><p>PHILLIP: It was, I mean?</p><p>TAPPER: Of the battleground states?</p><p>PHILLIP: It depends -- of the battleground States, yes, it was.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>COATES: Yes. PHILLIP: But the reason I hesitated to even respond to that is because we're talking about over 10,000 votes. That's a lot --</p><p>TAPPER: Right.</p><p>PHILLIP: That's actually a lot of votes that Trump was down by. And yet, they still pursued this strategy, of trying to basically fraudulently overturn an election, in that State.</p><p>But as it relate to the story, in the indictment, they really do have to show what is the connection, between all of these different storylines that have been playing out that we know a little bit about. And if that connection goes all the way up to the White House, and to former President Trump? That's the crux of the matter.</p><p>That is why Georgia matters so much, because it is kind of unlike the January 6 case, which is sort of centered on the broad scope of things, this is almost like a case study, of how to try to steal an election, and luckily, how they failed.</p><p>But the indictment needs to show kind of what that connection is, between all of these different schemes that were out there that we do know something about.</p><p>COATES: And by the way, the viewing and consuming public has seen an indictment, recently, about election-related interference.</p><p>PHILLIP: Right.</p><p>COATES: And although there is absolutely no requirement there be any coordination, or even conversation, between Fani Willis, and of course Jack Smith, the public has already seen one.</p><p>And so, there might be a temptation to think this has got to be different from that. Otherwise, why would you have a separate jurisdiction, other than Jack Smith's overseeing of the investigation? Well, simple matter is that's a federal case that Jack Smith has. This is a State-level case.</p><p>Why is that, so significant? Well, State cases?</p><p>PHILLIP: Right.</p><p>COATES: One can't pardon one from everyone -- in the White House.</p><p>TAPPER: Were he to become president, again, yes.</p><p>COATES: Were he to become president, or actually, if some of the candidates, who've already vowed that they would indeed pardon him, if they were to become the RNC nominee, and eventual president, that also would not immediately apply to any of that as well. And so, you've got this overarching thing.</p><p>And then, one more point, politically, Georgia is significant, because these weren't like Democrats that he was trying to convince, otherwise, to say, I want to find one more than a Democratic candidate.</p><p>GANGEL: Right.</p><p>COATES: This is Brad Raffensperger. This is the General Counsel as well. What was his name? Ryan Germany, the former GC of the Secretary of State. This was the actual Republican governor as well, Brian Kemp. All of who rejected the actual pressure campaign, which is really the crux of the entirety of it.</p><p>And so, the arguments that would suggest, \"Oh, I couldn't get a fair jury here,\" like the ones they're talking about in D.C., might not apply for different reasons.</p><p>TAPPER: So, Jamie, one of the other things that's interesting about this, obviously, is we can't ignore the political ramifications of it, which is the fact that Donald Trump is far and away likely to be the Republican presidential candidate, based on -- nominee, based on today's facts, anyway.</p><p>GANGEL: Right.</p><p>TAPPER: And, right now, is polling it 43 percent against Joe Biden's 43 percent, in the latest New York Times poll.</p><p>I asked Marc Short, Vice President Pence's Chief of Staff, earlier today, do you think the fourth indictment of Donald Trump is going to have an impact? And what he said is that there is a difference. He acknowledged that the indictments have had a rallying effect, to help Trump, in the Republican primaries.</p><p>But he said there is a difference, between this period, and of this jurisprudence, and the period, where there is actual information, presented, in a court of law, where Donald Trump is a defendant, and day after day after day damning testimony is presented against him.</p><p>Now, that might be wishful thinking. But they are two different things.</p><p>[21:25:00]</p><p>GANGEL: So, one thing that may not be wishful thinking? And we don't know when these trials are going to happen. Donald Trump has not yet been named in this one. But in addition to, in Georgia, you couldn't pardon yourself. There are cameras, in the courtroom, in Georgia.</p><p>MCCABE: That's right.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>MCCABE: That's right.</p><p>GANGEL: And I think that has a very different effect.</p><p>Think back to the New York indictment, where we just had the still photographs, of Donald Trump, sitting there, at the table. It had a different feel. We have not seen that in D.C. We didn't see it in Florida.</p><p>That said, the Republican base, the pro-Trump Republican base, has not seemed swayed thus far. And this Georgia case could go, after the election.</p><p>PHILLIP: Well, look, voters are going to have to make up their mind. They're probably not going to get conclusive verdicts, in all of these cases, certainly.</p><p>But in a case like this, with a scope, a State-level case, you could be looking at a long period of time. They're going to have to make up their minds based on the allegations, contained in this document, which is why the indictment itself is so important.</p><p>Obviously, the process when it plays out, from a legal perspective, is critically important, what happens to Donald Trump. But for the voters, they may not have the benefit, of a verdict, and a conclusion, before they have to decide, whether he's going to be the Republican nominee, or he's going to be potentially the next President of the United States.</p><p>BORGER: And --</p><p>TAPPER: Right. I mean, the Iowa caucus votes are January 15th.</p><p>PHILLIP: In January, yes.</p><p>TAPPER: January 15th, which is certainly well before this trial would start.</p><p>PHILLIP: And so far, the earliest hearing is May.</p><p>BORGER: Can I just say?</p><p>PHILLIP: Not this one.</p><p>BORGER: The other candidates have to make up their minds too.</p><p>PHILLIP: Yes, well, yes.</p><p>BORGER: About how they're going to treat this. It's not just the voters out there.</p><p>And, by the way, I believe it's up to the discretion of the judge, about whether you televise. You can televise in Georgia. But let's see what the presiding judge would want to do.</p><p>But the other candidates have to kind of fish or cut bait at some point. And if this is going to be televised, and some of the candidates have been tiptoeing around Donald Trump, et cetera, they have to decide what tack they take against him.</p><p>TAPPER: All right. I want to throw to Kaitlan Collins, right now.</p><p>Kaitlan?</p><p>COLLINS: Jake.</p><p>And joining us now is CNN Contributor, Geoff Duncan, who is the former Republican Lieutenant Governor, of the State of Georgia. And tonight, a witness before that grand jury today.</p><p>Geoff, what do you think, what role, do you think, your testimony played, in these 10 indictments that we're learning about now?</p><p>GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I certainly answered the questions that they gave me with -- and supply them with the facts, and details that I knew existed.</p><p>And that's what this is all about, is just getting the facts to the surface. I mean, finally, it's taken two-and-a-half years, to move past all of this misinformation, and all of these conspiracy theories. The facts will rise to the top. And thankfully, it's taken us to this point here, now.</p><p>COLLINS: What was it like, I mean, to even be in that room today? Was it intense? I mean, how would you describe it?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, it certainly felt like the center of the universe. I mean, there was no doubt, in my mind it was a very serious tone, a very prepared tone. Everybody in the room knew why they were there, to weigh the facts and present the facts. And of course, my job was to answer the questions. It was very, very serious. No doubt.</p><p>COLLINS: We saw several other witnesses, also going in and out, today, to presumably testify. Can you just give us a ballpark of how many other witnesses were waiting to go in, when you were there?</p><p>DUNCAN: I prefer to let the District Attorney answer that question. That just -- it's probably not the right time for me to answer that.</p><p>COLLINS: From the questions they asked, did you get a sense that they have a real understanding, of the entire scheme of everything that was happening here?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, there was certainly a firm grasp, of what the details were, right? And just wanting to confirm information, connections, all of that stuff, around all the different scenarios, you know?</p><p>And this isn't specifically speaking about my testimony, today. But I've been, I've literally, like I told you the other night, I've written a book about this, right?</p><p>So, connecting these dots, on all these wild, far-fetched conspiracy theories, connecting the dots on how you get to a point, that Brad Raffensperger's, the phone call happens with him, how you get fake electors, how you have mock hearings that are presented, as though they're real, and serious?</p><p>There's a whole trail of information that I think America is going to get to see. And quite honestly, as a Republican that wants to see us win going forward, we need to use this as a pivot point, right? Look, we have to take this moment serious. This can't just be about the case. This can't just be about a trial. As a Republican Party, we need to take this as an opportunity to move on.</p><p>And look, it's going to take a team effort here. All these candidates that are out there running, can't just kind of stick their toes, in the water, and kind of call Donald Trump out for lying. They can't just kind of call him out for the election wasn't really rigged. They need to fully jump into it and say, \"You know what? This is wrong.\"</p><p>We need senators, we need governors, we need everybody, to get on board, and not only say that Donald Trump's wrong, but Donald Trump needs to get out of this race. It's best for the Republican Party and ultimately, it's best for this country if he's not in this race in 2024.</p><p>[21:30:00]</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I mean, speaking of Donald Trump, he posted about you, today, saying that you shouldn't go and testify. He talked about how you refused his demands, to call a Special Session. I mean, beyond the fact he also spelled your name wrong, I mean, did you see that, as an effort, for -- to witness-tamper? Or how did you view that post from him?</p><p>DUNCAN: Well, I've faced much tougher opponents in my life than Donald Trump. I'm certain of that. And secondly, you spell Geoff with a G, not a J. I got there on time. I was ready to testify. Nothing he was going to say was going to deter me.</p><p>And quite honestly, I've been playing this game, for two and a half plus years. This isn't the first time he's tweeted at me. This isn't the first time he's spoken down to me or many others, right? It's just his game. He's a small man, in a big job. And he just gets to put that on display every minute of every day.</p><p>COLLINS: But what kind of effect do you think that has, on other witnesses? I mean, you're going into that room today. You're the former Lieutenant Governor of the State. You're someone, who is used to the public eye. I mean, there are other witnesses that we know that have gone that certainly aren't in that same position that you are. I mean, do you believe that he's trying to pressure witnesses here?</p><p>DUNCAN: Well, I don't know what Donald Trump's game is. I've stopped guessing what his game is. Look, it certainly was uncalled for. If I was one of his attorneys, I can't imagine they would have enjoyed waking up to watching him send what he sent in my direction, today. I mean, it doesn't make the situation any easier.</p><p>And Kaitlan, by the way, this makes the math continuing to be impossible, if you want to win, as a Republican, right? I mean, you can throw red meat to the crowd, and get 35 percent, 40 percent, maybe 50 percent of Republicans, to kind of sort of support you.</p><p>But you lose the game, when you try to jump in and try to beat a Democrat, like Joe Biden. This should be the easiest election, for us, to win in decades, maybe in a century. But yet, we can't even break the strings of gravity, because Donald Trump is the wrong candidate, just like Herschel Walker was the wrong candidate. I mean, this is so easy to see coming. We can't just try to win primaries. We got to win generals.</p><p>COLLINS: But do you believe that this is -- I mean, this would be the fourth indictment, if Trump's name is on that list of 10 indictments? Do you believe this is a moment that crystallizes that for your party? Because it doesn't seem like the others have? At least not for the Republican primary voters.</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, this one feels different, right? I think, I'm anxious to see the indictment. It sounds like there's 10-plus folks that are going to be mentioned, in this indictment.</p><p>I think there's going to be a lot of story behind that, right? Who got indicted? Who didn't get indicted? Who may be cut a deal? Which elements they indicted? What crimes? I mean, there's going to be a lot to have here.</p><p>But this is -- this feels different. You know what? Donald Trump did his most damage in Georgia. He sucked the soul out of the Republican Party here. He's sucked the morality out of the Republican Party, the fiscal responsibility out of the Republican Party. He sucked our winning percentage, out of the Republican Party.</p><p>He's taken everything from us. And it is our turn to take it back, right? It's our turn to win elections based on the policies that we think we're better on.</p><p>This is the prime spot for us to take Joe Biden to the woodshed, and call him out for not running the border, right, not protecting our communities, not putting our best foot forward, internationally. These are our moments in time. But if we make this about the three-ring circus of Donald Trump, we will lose, lose and lose again.</p><p>COLLINS: You make a good point that this isn't just about Trump. I mean, there are several other names that we expect to be in here, including, I mean, some pretty prominent members, of your party, in that State, potentially.</p><p>Do you expect to see some Georgia Republicans that you're used to working with potentially in this list of indictments when we find out the names?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, I mean, certainly wait and see the names. But all along, I've certainly, anticipated seeing several folks. I mean, look, this list of fake electors is members of the Republican Party, some elected folks, some successful business owners. I mean, this is just a wide swath of who the Republican Party should have looked like. And they got sucked in.</p><p>And I think it's going to be interesting to watch this case play out. Some folks showed up into those -- into that fake elector room, because the sitting president, or some official told them, it was the right thing to do. And some folks showed up, because it was a sinister plot. It'll take time to unpack who is who.</p><p>But then, look, even these fake hearings, in the Senate, right? I mean, this was just -- this was all about creating enough theater, to take a little grass fire, and turn it into a forest fire. That's what this was about, each and every day, was taking these little notions, these little tweets, these little kind of blips, on the radar, and turning them into something that was supposed to be reality.</p><p>It's taken two-and-a-half years. But I'm starting to tell you that's going to unwind and change directions.</p><p>COLLINS: You weren't actually even supposed to testify, until tomorrow morning, you said. And then, something changed. You were asked to come in earlier. I mean, what does that say to you, about how quickly, the District Attorney was moving here?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, I wasn't behind the scenes. I just answered the -- answered the call, and reported, on a shorter timeline.</p><p>Could not be any more grateful for the respect of the law enforcement officers. I mean, there's just heavy, heavy security. Everybody was doing their job. And also the District Attorney's office was very kind, and cordial, and navigated us through what was certainly a difficult day.</p><p>[21:35:00]</p><p>COLLINS: Do you think the former President sees the difference, in what could potentially be this indictment, with the federal indictments he's facing? I mean we've talked to sources, in his world, who have said, he sees the 2024 run, as legal installation for that.</p><p>But Georgia would be a very different case. He wouldn't be able to presumably pardon himself, for example, if he got reelected.</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, the one tool Donald Trump doesn't have with him anymore, for the most part, is that most folks aren't attracted to wanting to be in his cool kids club anymore, right?</p><p>If I looked at kind of the shrapnel flying around, in the post-2020 election, there was a lot of these elected state senators, and local county officials, missing (ph) an opportunity to buddy up with the President of the United States, whether it was calling them, or texting them, or somebody in his inner circle. So, they gravitated towards the cool kids club?</p><p>Well, I've got to imagine a number of those folks aren't very attracted by that anymore, right? \"Am I going to go spend time in jail, or tell the truth?\" My guess is they're going to gravitate towards the truth. And so, that's certainly going to work against him.</p><p>And look, there's no doubt about, where I've been on this. Two things we're certain on all of this stuff. It felt so coordinated, right? But it also felt sloppy. And to me, that's probably a bad recipe, for somebody that's in this position. COLLINS: When you look at this, and the bigger picture of this, and what you've just said about what you believe, elected Republicans, and high-ranking Republicans, you feel need to say specifically about this. I mean, what does it say, if they don't? If this indictment does happen, and Trump's name is on that, and he's does still become your party's nominee for 2024? What does that say about your party?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, it says they're weak. I think any candidate, at this point in the game, that doesn't call somebody out for having multiple state and federal indictments, against them, and all of the other shrapnel that's flown, around Donald Trump, all the losing records, that's gravitated towards Donald Trump? They're weak, right?</p><p>Every single candidate with an R next to their name running for president ought to, right now, step out and say, \"You know what? Donald Trump, it's time for him to step down. For the good of the country, the best thing for you to do is to step out of this race and let somebody else step up to the plate.\"</p><p>I think we ought to have U.S. Senators ought to do that. Republican governors ought to do that. Influential folks, the biggest donors in the country ought to do that. We need to hold this man accountable, so we not only can get our party back, but so we can get our country back, right?</p><p>If we make this about the issues? If we go into 2024, and make this specifically about the issues? We make it about the border? We make it about the Military? We make it about education? We make it about the economy? Republicans will win up and down the ballots from coast to coast.</p><p>If we make it about the three-ring circus called Donald Trump, we will lose, lose and lose again, and continue losing.</p><p>COLLINS: Geoff Duncan, you testified, for over an hour, today. Thanks for joining us, tonight.</p><p>Anderson, back to you.</p><p>COOPER: Kaitlan, thanks so much.</p><p>CNN's Sara Murray is outside the courthouse, in Atlanta, with more on what the rest of the night might look like.</p><p>Sara, what are you hearing?</p><p>MURRAY: Well, look, we obviously want to know when we are going to know what is in these indictments, and if we could hear from Fulton County District Attorney. We are learning that she is still expected to make public statements, this evening. She's likely to hold a press conference, but that that is not going to happen, until these indictments are processed.</p><p>We're told that that could take one to three hours. So, we're still in this waiting game, to see how long it's actually going to take, the clerk's office, to process these indictments, to make them available, publicly. And then, after that happens, again, one to three hours from now, we're expecting the Fulton County District Attorney, to make public statements.</p><p>We should note the one to three hour clock, we're told, did start when the clerk left Judge McBurney's courtroom, and started heading down to the clerk's office. Your producers tell me that that was that I believe 9 o'clock and 38 seconds. So, we're already a little bit into that countdown. We'll see how quickly that they can actually process this through the clerk's office, and when we may hear something publicly.</p><p>Anderson?</p><p>COOPER: Sara, you want to get out of there? Don't you?</p><p>MURRAY: Yes.</p><p>No, I want to stay here all night. It's finally not 95 degrees.</p><p>COOPER: Uh-huh?</p><p>MURRAY: It's actually very nice out here.</p><p>COOPER: It's a pretty broad range of time, though, one to three hours. Any reason for such a huge window?</p><p>MURRAY: It's a little unclear to me, why there would be such a large window, other than obviously, they want to make sure that they do this by the book.</p><p>I think you talked a little bit earlier, about a document that Reuters had reported, was posted erroneously, potentially related to this case that the clerk's office disavowed is not an official document, earlier today.</p><p>So, I think that they want to be very painstaking, in how they process this to make sure it's done correctly, stamped officially, especially after all we've seen earlier today.</p><p>COOPER: All right, well, let us know when you hear something from the courthouse.</p><p>MURRAY: Yes.</p><p>COOPER: I'm joined by CNN Political Commentator, Alyssa Farah Griffin, a White House Communications Director, for the former President.</p><p>Back with us also, Senior Political Commentator, and former Republican Congressman, Adam Kinzinger; Political Commentator, Van Jones, former Special Adviser to President Obama; Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig; and former U.S. Attorney Michael Moore.</p><p>[21:40:00]</p><p>So Michael, you hear the worst-case scenario. I mean, it's that it'll take three hours, until the documents are made public. Why would it take so long?</p><p>MOORE: Well it normally would not. I mean I think this is just the belt-and-suspenders approach, given especially that there was sort of this misfiling that appeared, on the clerk's side, earlier today. So, they're just making sure they've got everything done that there are no technical errors, no clerical errors, out there that need to be corrected.</p><p>They can't do anything to change the vote of the grand jury, at this point. But this is just about making sure that the administrative process is done properly. And they know that there'll be a litany of folks that want a copy of this. And I imagine they're expecting that as well.</p><p>So, nothing particularly unusual, except this is an unusual case. It should not typically take this long and would not. But again, I think they're just making sure they've got it.</p><p>COOPER: Do you have any read on, given Fani Willis' history, what kind of -- how specific these indictments may be? Are they speaking indictments? I mean, what are you -- what are you expecting?</p><p>MOORE: I think she'll try to tell the story in the indictment. She gave a press interview, one time, when she really said, \"Well, the people want to know what happened.\" So, it wouldn't surprise me to see that.</p><p>And I wouldn't be surprised either to see that this is a single indictment with a lot of defendants named in the document, maybe 10 defendants, so, 10 people were indicted. That's very possible.</p><p>Because again, especially, if you're talking about a RICO case, where she's naming several people, she's talking about this scheme?</p><p>And remember that RICO really is just being able to talk about everybody's dirty laundry, and not just one defendant's problems, and the allegations against that one defendant. I mean, you get to get sold out by everybody, that you know, who was part of your corrupt organization.</p><p>And so, that's why I think there'll be much detail here. She probably remembers that Alvin Bragg was criticized, for the New York case, when it first came out that it was not detailed enough.</p><p>And certainly, she's had the time, to prepare, and to give a very detailed indictment, given the time she spent, both with a Special Purpose grand jury, in the intervening time, as she's led up to this very short and abbreviated presentment, to a regular criminal grand jury.</p><p>COOPER: Elie, do you agree with that?</p><p>HONIG: I do. I think we should expect to see quite a bit of detail out of Fani Willis.</p><p>Let's remember, this investigation was opened up two-and-a-half years ago. She has heard from dozens of witnesses, in the grand jury, including Geoff Duncan. And I think she has said, quite a bit, publicly, about what her intentions are. She has been careful to toe the line to not step over.</p><p>But yes, I'd be stunned, if we just saw what we call bare-bones indictments that just sort of list the name of the person indicted, the date of the crime and the statutory sight to the crime.</p><p>I think what we're going to see here is a detailed narrative. Part of that is because you want to get the public ready for what's to come. And also, there's a story to tell here. I think, Fani Willis clearly understands that. Yes, she's doing the normal job here. But he's also speaking to the general public, enter the history books. So, I do expect to see a lot of detail.</p><p>COOPER: And Elie, how are the defendants notified that they've been indictment? I mean, would they learn about it by watching TV? Are they formally notified by the District Attorney's office before the indictments are released to the public?</p><p>HONIG: Yes, let's hope they don't learn about it from us.</p><p>The way it should work? There's not a rule requiring this. But any practice, any good, courteous practice from the prosecutor, is you call up the defense lawyer, and you notify them, directly. You may tell them, \"We're going to send you the indictment now.\"</p><p>But I think what Fani Willis is going to do here is she's not going to want to give potentially Donald Trump, or anyone else, who may have been indicted, any sort of head-start here.</p><p>So, if I'm in Fani Willis' shoes here, what I'm going to do is, wait until these indictments get fully stamped, and scanned, and docketed by the clerk. And then, before they become public, I would come downstairs. I would make my public comments. And right at that moment, I would have them sent to the defense lawyers, essentially, as I took the podium.</p><p>And I think we can expect to see some strategic thought, into how that goes, tonight, because she does not want to have her first words, to us, sort of preempted by a Truth Social tweet.</p><p>COOPER: Alyssa, this is the first time we're hearing from you tonight. What are you anticipating on the eve, literally, on the cusp of hearing what the indictments are?</p><p>ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, listen, I've long said that I think this is the investigation that Donald Trump's most afraid of.</p><p>And Kaitlan alluded to this point. But of course, as it's a State case, he does not have the potential, if reelected, to grant himself a pardon, or to wrap up a DOJ investigation.</p><p>And going even further than that, even if he weren't to win reelection, I think that there are some within his camp, who think that they could potentially appeal a federal case, up into a Supreme Court.</p><p>This is very different. He doesn't have that sort of jurisdiction, in Georgia, if he in fact was indicted, and then charged. So, he's been very afraid of it. And I mean, there -- the facts of this case are -- is clear as day. We all heard the phone call. We heard the pressure campaign.</p><p>And I'm just reminded I was actually with the former President, on his last stop, in Georgia. I believe we were in Macon County, right before the election was called for Joe Biden. And I remember him saying like this, \"There's no way we could lose Georgia,\" because he did have such a massive audience turned out for him.</p><p>[21:45:00]</p><p>But his team was just wrong. It was a State that they were not predicting well enough, where, how close it was? We were paying more attention to Pennsylvania, to North Carolina, and other States.</p><p>So, I think he was genuinely caught off-guard, when he lost. And then, he just kind of got into this survival mode. And I mean, the crimes, the offenses just followed from there.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman Kinzinger, I mean, given that the former President was the only person indicted, by Jack Smith, in conjunction with the 2020 election, at least so far, would it be satisfying to you, if others, who were involved or prosecuted, in Georgia?</p><p>ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, it's tough. I don't want to say satisfying, because, you know, it's a -- but yes.</p><p>I mean, after what we saw on the January 6 committee, after, you've seen people out not just carrying the President's water, because they can carry his water, but out there really just destroying democracy?</p><p>I think seeing this, what I call the second tier level of people being indicted, it'll be -- I think it will be essential for democracy. I think it'll be essential for justice. It'll be essential for the defense of this kind of self-governance thing that we've tried to do as this country.</p><p>Because it's saying, yes, if you attack the Capitol, as an example, you're going to go to jail. We've done that. We've seen that. But if you instigate that? If you destroy faith in elections, and you do it an illegal way? You'll be held accountable as well.</p><p>I just continue though, today -- I mean, I saw I think Vivek Ramaswamy's tweet or something, going after this.</p><p>I have no idea Anderson, why anybody, but Donald Trump is running for President of the United States, unless you're somebody like Chris Christie, Will Hurd, or Asa Hutchinson.</p><p>Because all these other candidates are doing nothing but defending Donald Trump, for his absolute utter law-breaking, because they're too scared to say the truth. I don't get it. Drop out and endorse Donald Trump, if you're unwilling to go after him. He's the front-runner.</p><p>But I just, to this day, and I think once we read this indictment, we're going to be even more shocked at what's in there. And I will be even more shocked, to see some of my former colleagues, and candidates for President, continue to defend him.</p><p>COOPER: Van, what are your expectations?</p><p>VAN JONES, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I just think it was really moving, to see regular people, everyday people, doing their job, of walking those documents, up to that judge.</p><p>You think about it. We live in a country where that happens every day. It's just the regular kind of majesty of the wheels turning of justice. But in a lot of countries, someone like Donald Trump would be untouchable, absolutely untouchable.</p><p>And certainly, just everyday working people would have no shot at all, to say, \"Hey, there's a line here and you've crossed it, and you've got to come in this court, and answer.\" But in our country, that's what happens. And that's what happened today.</p><p>And so, I just felt it was moving. Those are just regular working folks. And they put their time in, and they saw information, they got evidence. And they could have said, \"Hey, listen. We don't want any of this. He's too big. He's too powerful.\" They didn't do that.</p><p>And so, my expectation is that we're going to hear from this prosecutor. I am hopeful that after two-and-a-half year wait, what's on the papers, will be strong, will be powerful, will give us more insight that maybe we don't have already. And I'm very much looking forward to hearing what she has to say.</p><p>COOPER: What do you expect? I mean, do you have an expectation of what these indictments might contain?</p><p>JONES: Well, I mean, in order for this to make sense, from just a historical point of view, you already have Jack Smith. I mean, he's put a lot of energy toward this case. Georgia is a part of the federal indictment.</p><p>So, I think what you're going to see is a deeper assessment, and more people named. I think you're going to have a better sense of all the different players in the different parts. That's my hope anyway, because this was a straight-up conspiracy.</p><p>This is not just Donald Trump making one phone call. That's what we all think about this, what we all know about, which is so outrageous. This is an absolute on-the-ground multi-party conspiracy, to overthrow an election, in Georgia, and to make sure that the voters in Georgia?</p><p>And we all know the history of Georgia, and how hard it was, to win the right to vote, in Georgia, how many martyrs we put in the ground in Georgia. You think about a John Lewis. You think about all the things that have gone on, in Georgia. For that State to be the place where Donald Trump says \"I'm going to put those votes in the garbage can, because I don't want to leave office,\" and for an African American, let's just say an African American District Attorney, to stand up, and say, \"No buddy. That's not how it works here,\" I think it's powerful.</p><p>COOPER: It's also extraordinary when you just for a moment, reflect on the fact that there was a sitting president, going after two election workers, two Black women, who were doing a job, which they have done before. And a patriotic job, a really important job, that they took pride in, and really went after them, and destroyed their lives.</p><p>JONES: Ruined their lives.</p><p>[21:50:00]</p><p>COOPER: I mean, they had to go into try to hide. And they're not people, who have a lot of resources, and security teams.</p><p>JONES: Right. And I think that's what sometimes gets lost in this whole sense of what's going on here. That's what democracy is, Anderson. It's everyday people, it's working people deciding, hey, I'm going to sit here in front of a little cardboard table --</p><p>COOPER: Yes.</p><p>JONES: -- a little card table, and I'm going to help my neighbors vote.</p><p>COOPER: Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, they were.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>COOPER: Yes.</p><p>JONES: Yes. \"And I'm going to help my neighbors vote. And I'm going to make sure that all these little documents get done, and things get signed off on, so that everybody matters, everybody's vote counts,\" and you don't think your life is going to be destroyed for doing that.</p><p>COOPER: Yes. And you had Rudy Giuliani sweating hair dye, calling them, like alleging they were drug dealers.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>COOPER: And just it's stunning that they were -- these powerful people, reached down, and picked these two Black women, and just destroyed their lives?</p><p>JONES: And today, some people, who were also may be considered powerless, in the ordinary course of things, also, African Americans, and others, reached back up, and grabbed Donald Trump, by the lapel and said, \"Buddy, that doesn't work in America.\" And that's the power of today. That's what you just saw.</p><p>COOPER: Yes. Let's get back to Jake, at D.C.</p><p>Jake?</p><p>TAPPER: Thanks, Anderson.</p><p>I'm still here with CNN correspondents, and analysts, Andrew McCabe, Gloria Borger, Abby Phillip, Jamie Gangel, and Laura Coates.</p><p>And something interesting that Jamie Gangel reminded us of is that it was just a few months ago, that Judge David Carter, who was ordering Trump attorney, John Eastman, who is thought to be one of the co- conspirators in the federal charge?</p><p>Judge Carter ruled that Donald Trump had handed in information that he had sworn, under oath was true, in a Georgia lawsuit, even though John Eastman, according to emails, had told Donald Trump, this information is not true. You cannot swear that it -- you cannot swear that it's accurate. And he did it anyway.</p><p>That's a crime, I would think?</p><p>MCCABE: Of course. Of course, right?</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>MCCABE: Signing an affidavit in support of a lawsuit?</p><p>TAPPER: Would that be a Georgia crime?</p><p>MCCABE: That would be -- that would be a Georgia crime. Could be perjury, false statement, to court officials. So yes, absolutely. You can't deliberately make a false representation to the court, and of course of a civil lawsuit.</p><p>TAPPER: It's interesting, because I've wondered why it is that Georgia has been doing this, when we know that the pressure campaign took place, in Arizona, in Michigan --</p><p>BORGER: Right, right.</p><p>TAPPER: -- in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in Georgia, obviously. Why Georgia?</p><p>BORGER: It is (ph).</p><p>TAPPER: And it really does seem that he left a lot of fingerprints, on the glass, in Georgia.</p><p>BORGER: Right. Right. Yes. And I was just reminded that it wasn't only Raffensperger, he spoke to, in the tape-recorded phone call.</p><p>But he also called the Chief Investigator for the State for elections, for the State of Georgia. And what he said to her, apparently, on the phone, is that, \"If you don't do the right thing, you're going to be in trouble. I'm not the one who's going to be in trouble. You're the one who's going to be in trouble.\" So, it was quite threatening to her.</p><p>And what she said back to him, apparently, was \"We're going to get to the truth, Mr. President. That's our job to get to the truth.\"</p><p>So, was this a tape-recorded conversation? Did Raffensperger tell all his people, \"If you ever get these calls, tape-record them?\" So they're -- you know, I've got to think that there's a lot of stuff, just like in the federal indictments, that there's a lot of stuff that we don't know, and a lot of conversations that were had, that we don't know about yet, that could really incriminate Donald Trump, because he was not shy --</p><p>PHILLIP: Yes. And --</p><p>BORGER: -- about calling people.</p><p>PHILLIP: And I think that that is why Georgia, right?</p><p>BORGER: Right. And it is.</p><p>PHILLIP: The \"Why Georgia\" is because Trump himself was the one making the calls, and doing a lot of the pressuring. And --</p><p>TAPPER: -- he was making calls to like --</p><p>PHILLIP: That's, yes --</p><p>TAPPER: -- county clerks, in Michigan.</p><p>PHILLIP: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: I mean?</p><p>PHILLIP: That's true. But I think that, I mean, I think that just as at a minimum, the minimum bar is that Trump needs to have been deeply involved, in a lot of this. That was true in Georgia. It was true in Michigan. It was true in Arizona.</p><p>And then, the other part of it is Fani Willis. Van just alluded to this. She has decided that she's going to take this on. She's going to take on a former President. Not every prosecutor wants to do that, whether or not the law is clear or not.</p><p>So, I do think that the conflict between Trump and these prosecutors, or particularly the Black women, that he is always at loggerheads with, is part of the narrative here, too. She's determined to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>[21:55:00]</p><p>And Trump is, I think, particularly incensed by that, and describes all of these people, as not just the Black women, but even the Black man, as in New York, he describes all these people as political operatives going after him, for political reasons.</p><p>But that's part of the narrative and the conflict of why I think we're seeing this case, unfolding with the scope that it is.</p><p>TAPPER: Yes.</p><p>PHILLIP: Precisely.</p><p>COATES: And that's why it's so scary, in some respects. The second I saw, the activity inside the courtroom, a part of me obviously, somebody who wants to know what's going on, inside the courtroom, wants to figure out wants to see it live, doesn't want to rely on the sketches. Somebody who wants to be in the courtroom is obviously leaning in.</p><p>But then when you see the fact that this now opens up each of the people within that courtroom, to the exposure of the wrath of somebody, who's not afraid, to use the court of public opinion, and bend it at its will, in a way that undermines the safety at times with people?</p><p>You already heard Judge Chutkan, in the Washington, D.C. case, leading to the culmination of January 6th, saying \"Listen, the more you play in this court of public opinion, the likelihood increases that I may move that trial date up.\" Now, I wonder if this judge will have a similar notion here.</p><p>But for the very reasons you articulated Abby, we just saw, although she is a -- was a clerk, it seemed, we saw a Black woman walk across that screen, next to a Black man.</p><p>You've already heard Fani Willis be called \"Racist\" by Donald Trump. You've heard accusations that she has been somehow in an intimate experience, a relationship, with a gangbanger, for some reason, because it helps his narrative. And so, her security has had to increase.</p><p>All of this, the idea of courtroom drama and antics, presents opportunities to become a spectacle. And it really cannot be. It has to be following the notion that we are watching it all unfold that a former President of the United States, chose Georgia at all different levels, to try to, allegedly, go forward with this plan.</p><p>That's why the RICO charge would be something so interesting to see, if it happens. That is the quintessential charge, you use, when you want to punish, not just the ringleader, or the minions, but all of the parties involved.</p><p>TAPPER: And one of the things, Jamie, I asked a high-ranking government official, in one of these other States that has not brought an investigation forward.</p><p>GANGEL: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: And I said, \"Well, how come Michigan is charging its fake electors, and your State is not?\"</p><p>And the top official said, \"They had enough.\" I'm not telling you this. \"They had enough\" -- GANGEL: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: -- \"They had enough caveats, in his State,\" in the phony electoral language --</p><p>GANGEL: Right.</p><p>TAPPER: -- unlike in Michigan, where that State didn't feel like they could make out State charges.</p><p>GANGEL: Right.</p><p>TAPPER: So, I think one of the other variables here is what are the State laws, and how ham-handed were these schemers, in that State? It seems as though in some States the people doing this, at least according to this government official, doing the fake electors scheme, were a little bit more clever than the ones in Michigan.</p><p>BORGER: I mean, who was involved?</p><p>GANGEL: Right.</p><p>BORGER: I mean, was it not just a bunch of fake electors? Was it the President's former Chief of Staff, who went to Atlanta with him? Was it the former President of the United States?</p><p>Nobody had a position low enough for the President to say \"Well, I'm not going to talk to that person.\" I mean, he talked to everybody. So, I think Georgia, the evidence just mounted and mounted and mounted. And Raffensperger tape-recorded him.</p><p>PHILLIP: Yes, I would like to see what the State cross (ph) has as well.</p><p>GANGEL: There is no question --</p><p>BORGER: Yes, yes.</p><p>GANGEL: There is no question that Georgia was extremely -- Trump and his allies were extremely aggressive, in Georgia. We see it over and over again. It's --</p><p>TAPPER: He's the first Republican to lose that State, since 1996?</p><p>GANGEL: And also, to your point earlier --</p><p>BORGER: Two Senate seats.</p><p>GANGEL: -- these were Republicans. You had a Republican governor. You had Geoff Duncan with a G, Republican lieutenant governor, Brad Raffensperger, Gabriel Sterling. These were all Republicans.</p><p>TAPPER: And not squishes either --</p><p>GANGEL: No.</p><p>TAPPER: -- as conservatives refer to moderates.</p><p>GANGEL: No, no.</p><p>TAPPER: These are diehard conservative Republicans.</p><p>PHILLIP: Right. And can I just say?</p><p>GANGEL: But could I just underscore one last thing? Abby, you said earlier the point that Trump was, quote, \"Deeply involved.\" And I think that's what we have to go back to here. He was at the center of all of this. This all happened, for one reason. He refused to accept the outcome of the election.</p><p>PHILLIP: My only point? We should not forget. This is the State of Georgia. Trump targeted Georgia, and the parts of Georgia, where people of color lived, to try to disenfranchise them. People like Rudy Giuliani spread racist lies, about election workers, in order to try to disenfranchise voters.</p><p>[22:00:00]</p><p>You cannot disentangle that from Fani Willis' will, and her view, that this is necessary and important, to prosecute that, in this particular State, heart of the voting rights movement in this country. Voters' (ph) motivation matters. And I think that's part of it for her as well.</p><p>TAPPER: We are at just about 10 PM Eastern Time, seven seconds away, with Donald Trump, seemingly on the cusp of indictment number four.</p><p>Jake Tapper, here in Washington, along with Anderson Cooper, and Kaitlan Collins.</p><p>COOPER: Jake, a little more than an hour ago, grand jury, in Atlanta, handed up 10 indictments, in Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis' investigation, of the former President's attempt to over his 2020 Georgia defeat.</p><p>COLLINS: And Anderson, those indictments are sealed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSWKCN-2023081401CNV51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSWKCN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C22-0R31-F072-X17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11258\"/><timeReceived>09:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network, Inc.

'This fire quickly erupted by sundown,' Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia told reporters on Thursday. </p><p>'This will be a major fire for several days.' It's not immediately clear what started the fire, which was first reported on Wednesday afternoon and has since destroyed several structures and continues to threaten thousands more. L.A. County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the areas where the fire has blazed have 'not burned in decades' and that firefighters were 'expecting significant temperatures' later on Thursday and into this weekend, adding to the difficulty in containing the blaze. Temporary shelters have been set up behind the Highland High School in Palmdale and the Castaic Sports Complex. Road closures[1] include Lake Hughes Road from Castaic to Pine Canyon, 3 Points Road to Pine Canyon Road, Ridge Route to Lake Hughes Road and San Francisquito Canyon Road, Stator Lane, to Elizabeth Lake. Those living northwest of Lake Hughes Road and Lake Elizabeth Road, on the West Trail Mountain View Road in the Lake Hughes Community, and everyone south of Highway 138, including the Pine Canyon community, are under a mandatory evacuation. No injuries have been reported as of Thursday morning. #LakeFire[2] 9:00 AM Press Conference <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/CdYxvEcQPn\">https://t.co/CdYxvEcQPn</url>[3] \u2014 L.A.

Crews plan to burn up to 285 acres. Timeframes for the burn depend on Lake County Air Quality Management District approval and the appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature, wind, fuel moisture, ventilation and humidity.</p><p>Fire personnel plan to begin ignitions Tuesday, Feb. 11 and continue through Thursday, Feb. 13. Crews will patrol the burned area through the weekend and into next week. On Tuesday, the forecast shows sunny skies, temperatures around 70 degrees and a light northeast wind. Conditions are expected to be cooler and cloudier Wednesday.</p><p>The objectives for the project include forest health improvement, hazardous fuels reduction near Lake Pillsbury communities and wildlife habitat protection.

The flight was traveling from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast, it added.</p><p>China Eastern flight 5735 had been traveling 455 knots (523 mph) at around 30,000 feet when it entered a steep dive around 2:20p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds later.</p><p>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board.</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \"all-out effort\" by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.</p><p>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patrolling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave.</p><p>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.</p><p>State media reported all 737-800s in China Eastern's fleet were ordered grounded. Aviation experts said it is unusual to ground an entire fleet of planes unless there is evidence of a problem with the model. China has more 737-800s than any other country - nearly 1,200 of the planes, and if other Chinese airlines ground the plane, it \"could have a significant impact on domestic travel,\" said aviation consultant IBA.</p><p>Boeing 737-800s have been flying since 1998, and Boeing has sold more than 5,100 of them. They have been involved in 22 accidents that totaled the planes and killed 612 people, according to data compiled by the Aviation Safety Network, an arm of the Flight Safety Foundation.</p><p>\"There are thousands of them around the world. It's certainly had an excellent safety record,\" the foundation's president, Hassan Shahidi, said of the 737-800.</p><p>China's air-safety record has improved since the 1990s as air travel has grown dramatically with the rise of a burgeoning middle class. Before Monday, the last fatal crash of a Chinese airliner occurred in August 2010, when an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines hit the ground short of the runway in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. All 44 people on board were killed. Investigators blamed pilot error.</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board tweeted Monday that it had picked a senior investigator to help with the crash investigation. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the 737-800 in the 1990s, said it was ready to help in the investigation if asked.</p><p>Chicago-based Boeing Co. said it was in contact with the U.S. safety board \"and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\" Boeing shares fell more than 4% in afternoon trading in New York.</p><p>Crash investigations are usually led by officials in the country where the crash occurred, but they typically include the airplane's manufacturer and the investigator or regulator in the manufacturer's home country.</p><p>Shahidi said he expects investigators to comb through the maintenance history of the plane and its engines, the training and records of the pilots, air traffic control discussions and other topics.</p><p>Headquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern is one of the country's top three airlines, operating scores of domestic and international routes serving 248 destinations.</p><p>The aircraft was delivered to the airliner from Boeing in June 2015 and had been flying for more than six years. China Eastern Airlines uses the Boeing 737-800 as a workhorse of its fleet - the airline has more than 600 planes, and 109 are Boeing 737-800s.</p><p>Broadcaster CCTV said China Eastern set up nine teams to deal with aircraft disposal, accident investigation, family assistance and other pressing matters.</p><p>The CAAC and China Eastern both said they had sent officials to the crash site in accordance with emergency measures.</p><p>China Eastern online made its website have a black-and-white homepage after the crash.</p><p>The accident quickly became a leading topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, with 1.34 billion views and 690,000 discussions. Many posts expressed condolences to the families of victims, while others questioned the planes' safety.</p><p>The twin-engine, single-aisle Boeing 737 in various versions has been flying for more than 50 years and is one of the world's most popular planes for short and medium-haul flights.</p><p>The 737 Max, a later version, was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people. China's aviation regulator cleared the Max to return to service late last year, making the country the last major market to do so.</p><p>The deadliest crash involving a Boeing 737-800 came in January 2020, when Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard accidentally shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight, killing all 176 people on board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4862894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652C-VBV1-JCDM-J201-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Undetermined Undetermined revenues = $ 15.0 billion</p><p>PRESENTATION</p><p>Presentation 1. For those who just quick guess [little bit] on Tractor Supply at 2,200 stores, 49 states, approximately $15 billion in revenues this year, our guidance, so a little above.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL, MD &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. And we also have like Kurt Barton, as CFO, too. So this will be structured as an informal fireside chat. I'll be asking questions and then Tractor Supply team will be answering those questions. To the extent there are questions from the audience, I shoot them through the chat, and I'll be happy to work them into our conversation.</p><p>So gentlemen, look, I think at least I'm going to start just the conversation. One of the questions I get a lot from our clients, and that is going to sound pretty basic to those who know Tractor Supply, but more for the benefit of those who are maybe less familiar to the story. And Hal, you've mentioned this a bit in your opening there, but who is your customer? Who does Tractor Supply serve? And we want to understand how this -- how you serve well a very differentiated consumer? And then to what extent has that consumer base expanded here either through the pandemic or over in length of time?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY: Yes. Great place to start. I'd add, we serve Life Out Here, as I mentioned earlier. And our business has been around for 85 years. And we've spent those 85 years year after year, carefully curating 1 piece at a time the right business model to serve Life Out Here.</p><p>That starts with an 18,000 square foot selling space store. So not so large like a big box where you kind of lose productivity, not so small, let's say, like the equivalent of like 3,000 or 4,000 square foot as hardware where you're going to unable to really scale.</p><p>So the right kind of 15,000 to 20,000 square foot selling square foot box, provides convenience in and out, easy parking, but big enough where you can scale your productivity, then the assortment inside of carefully over time, curated the space allocated to that assortment, the type of assortment, the categories, but all really to serve Life Out Here.</p><p>So if you live in kind of country suburbia, rural America, you're a farmer, if you're a rancher or like we are, in many ways, your grocery store, we're your one-stop shop. Over 85% of our customers have pets and animals. So we have -- in animals, we have over 20% market share in animal feed in America.</p><p>And so far and away, the largest animal feed seller likely in the United -- the world from a [bad feed] perspective. And so poultry to chicken and equine and horse and cattle and just livestock feed in general, pet food, we're talking big 40-, 50-pound bags, not 5-pound bags, 10-pound bags because these -- our average customer has more than 2 pets, multiple animals, right?</p><p>When they're coming into our stores, they're stocking up on these large bags. And then we -- that's the kind of main traffic drivers. And then you've got apparel, which is mostly a workwear-type thing. So think Ariat boots, muck boots, work boots, work gloves, denim jeans, Carhartt, Columbia, things you need for Life Out Here, whether you're working out in your field, your pasture, on your farm or going to the local Applebee's for dinner on a Friday night.</p><p>Then we also sell a ton of truck tool and hardware. Majority of our sales there in things like trailers and truck boxes. Certainly, we sell power tools and hardware that are used for thing -- activities like fencing and welding, just about all of our customers have a welder somewhere in their home.</p><p>And then certainly, garden, riding lawn mowers because all of our customers have large lawns. And so we're the, if not one of the largest riding lawn mowers sellers in the United States, but also things like fertilizer and grass seed and certainly, those sorts of things that people need for multiple acres of land. But all carefully curated. And the origins of our business really came up out of the farm and ranch industry sector.</p><p>And what we've done is really expand the concept to a broader set of consumers that had historically been the kind of more narrow farm and ranch. We don't have a large national competitor that we compete with head to head. It's really more local market based. It might be a local co-op or it could be a farm mom-and-pop or a regional or a local player.</p><p>We certainly, at a national level, compete against category-specific retailers depending on the category, pet specialty and pad or grocery or maybe mass and pet and apparel, certainly, a whole variety of players. But no one at a national level competes kind of head-to-head with us on format as it relates to the format.</p><p>And then to your point, Brian is we started serving a more narrow and niche on farm and ranch. We've expanded our footprint, the categories we serve, the types of products. We've upgraded our store experience, particularly through our Fusion remodels and we've invited a whole another set of customers out who want to experience Life Out Here particularly the millennial generation.</p><p>And to that end, we've had significant customer growth over the last 4 years that's really expanded the base of Tractor Supply and been a large part of what's driven our -- on a 4-year basis in Q1 '19 to Q1 '23, 80% revenue growth.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Well, that's a great opening. Hal, I think it's a great flavor for your unique business. There's 1 topic I want to address before we really jump into the heart of everything that went on Tractor Supply. I know it's on the minds of investors, and it's unfortunately the weather. Last week, we heard from Tractor Supply when you report your first quarter results back in April.</p><p>And look, those of us who stayed your business for a long time, we know that you are susceptible, so to say, to weather variations through is particularly as a season chain. So that was a topic then. So I guess the question I want to ask is, how are you thinking about the weather now? When I look outside how the window does see more spring-like and how the Tractor Supply is basically performing against this weather backdrop?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I'll start out by kind of breaking our business into 3 buckets for the sake of the group on today's call and provide a little perspective there, then get into maybe a more near-term perspective. So one way to think about our business is in 3 buckets of kind of merchandising categories are consumable, usable and edible products.</p><p>And we aggregate products from across the business and lump them into this group. But think about them as almost like the grocery store products in our stores, animal feed, pet food, things like propane, wood pellets. These are things that are consumable. Our customers need them on a day in, day out basis.</p><p>That is well over the majority of our business and is a very stable business. And it's one we've grown over the last 5 to 10 years in an outsized way to lessen our reliance on weather-related products. And that business has been outperforming our total comp sales by 3 and 4x for the last probably 5, 6 quarters now and continues to do so.</p><p>We're gaining share in pet food. We're gaining share in animal feed. Those are very consistent products. People have to feed their pets and animals. And if we've learned anything in past downturns, they typically feed their pets and animals and take care of their kids before they do anything else.</p><p>The second piece of our business, which is only of around 15% is discretionary. So it's a small piece of our business. Things like gun safes, riding lawn mowers, trailers, these are bigger ticket items. There is a repair -- there is a replaced component to it, but there's also a discretionary component to it.</p><p>Those have been running kind of negative low double digits for the last 4 quarters, counting the 1 we're in, we'd already indicated that, that was our expectation here for Q2. And the big swing in our business is always the seasonal. It's less than half of our business. It varies anywhere from 30% to 40% depending on the quarter that we're in.</p><p>And like if you look at last year, Q2 and Q3 were okay. And so we were kind of at the lower is middle end of our comp range. Q4 was outstanding, and we ended up with over an 8% comp because we had really strong weather in Q4 last year. Q2 was -- I mean, Q1 of this year was difficult weather. And so we're kind of on the low side of our comp expectations, in fact, a little bit lower than that.</p><p>So just the swing on our comp from quarter-to-quarter is really the seasonal business with the Q business driving very sustained footsteps and comp transactions into our stores. And so there's a few weeks left here in the quarter, so I'm hesitant to say too much. But what I'd say is that if you look at the weather patterns, it was fine -- good in April.</p><p>The first couple of weeks in May, so the last couple of weeks of May, good. We had a Canadian forest fire that blanketed half of east of the Mississippi last week that kept some people from going outside. It was this back half of this week is looking very nice. So we'll see how it plays out. But the thing is that I think is the great thing about our business is we're demand-driven, we're needs-based. The vast majority of our business is consumable, usable product.</p><p>It's what's driving to sustain footsteps into our stores. It's what's driving our growth as a company and it's a very consistent, reliable component of our business. And it's why we continue to have positive comps when a lot of retail has gone negative, we've had positive comp continue to -- we're having positive comp transactions even in the context of where we are now, which most retailers are not having. So even in spite of the ebbs and flows of seasonality, this is a very attractive business, I would assert.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Very helpful, Hal. So let's jump, you mentioned in one of your comments about Fusion is we talked a lot about some of the internal initiatives that are happening within the existing capacity of Tractor Supply, so Fusion be one, what you're doing in your side lots and Kurt, I'd love to get you in the conversation as well. But so maybe just update the audience on these internal efforts, kind of where we are and the benefits we're starting to see.</p><p>The other thing I know, Kurt, you and I have had this conversation, but as you think about the near-term, intermediate-term comp algorithm, how much of the comps of Tractor Supply are coming from these internal initiatives as they're enhancing the productivity of your stores?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY: Yes. Good morning, everybody, and thanks, Brian, for the question. We've said that Fusion and our Side Lot Garden Centers are a key part of our opportunity to continue to grow our market share in this large $180 billion TAM. And it's the 1 area in live goods and Garden Centers that our customers told us that I engage in this hobby, it's a need or a part of our lifestyle that you modestly serve or underserved me.</p><p>And so it's from the beginning of launching it and our Life Out Here strategy, it was a key aspect of it. And today, we're roughly at 30% of our chain today has the Fusion reset remodel, and we're on a 5-, 6-year path of converting the entire chain.</p><p>Our goal of converting and renovating the Side Lot to have Garden Centers, feed rooms, drive-through and just turning that previous storage space for large ag equipment into a true shopping experience, we believe we've got the opportunity for roughly 2/3 of our chain to have that.</p><p>The biggest inhibitor for 100% is that if you've shopped our stores, we've got some great legacy stores that either don't have an attached Side Lot, don't have the space to be able to put that in, but it's a tremendous opportunity to be able to put that additional selling space and meet an area of our customers' needs. And so we're moving in that pace. We're roughly 15% of the chain with Garden Centers and Side Lot. We'll be reaching over 20% by the end of the year on that.</p><p>And again, on our path, we've said and seen through the results of 2022 and first half of 2023, the [smart] continue to prove the early indications that a Fusion-only store against an existing control group sees in the first 12 months, a mid-single-digit incremental lever.</p><p>If it's a combined combo store of both Fusion and Side Lot, high single-digit growth on incremental comp sales over its control group. The Fusion stores, in particular, would have most of their lift, say, in the first 12, 24 months for Garden Centers as you -- it draws in new customers. It allows customers to come in and then see the other 4 corners of the store.</p><p>Early indications, our belief, our model is that those combo stores have a maturity curve on their growth cycle. Yes, it's high single digits in the first year of the store, but there's still an outpaced growth as customers mature in the other categories for Tractor Supply. So our models, our belief is there's at least like a 3-year maturation curve on incremental sales.</p><p>And what that basically does if you -- we look at it as a 10-year investment and a 10-year return on invested capital, and the growth that we got on the investments we've got in both Fusion and the Garden Centers, are really giving us a return on investment consistent with the chain return on invested capital and a very productive at or above what investment you get in the first few years of a new store.</p><p>So you can see our excitement of take this additional capital and gain incremental sales while opening new stores and making the existing stores more productive.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. Kurt, if I can just follow up. So just from a consumer's perspective, when a store goes Fusion or when the Fusion update is, what do I see? What are the changes in that store?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON: Yes. For us, on Fusion, it's principally inside the store when you refer to Fusion. But the customer is going to see a significant change, especially like right when you walk in the store, the legacy store had cash registers, your old style cash registers right there. You're going to have a team member there, but you're going to have a lot of the help desk in the service and a lot of the offerings in the back of the store.</p><p>We converted free up a help desk space. And now we have pallet drops of high-volume product that we're selling there and converted the front into that hub space where it's basically a very convenient checkout, but also all of the help desk right there in the front of the store, engaging your customer.</p><p>You're going to have wider aisles. You're going to have brighter signage in indicating all the areas of lawn and garden, et cetera. So for our new customer that wants that better, more open, bright shopping experience, they're getting that with the new Fusion.</p><p>We've seen that we are moving pet and animal feed at paces that the existing stores weren't able to handle efficiently. So now it's created pallet drop spaces. So we can internally move and handle product more efficiently, and it's more efficient customer experience.</p><p>Lastly, it gives us more space for the growing pet industry. We've definitely made a statement that we are here in outdoor power equipment and power tools. So it's given us now a whole extended tool corral with Makita and many other brands besides DEWALT and others that we've had. We're certainly making sure that the growing consumer, those that are even more of a professional and want the Makita that Tractor Supply is everything from basic to best in regards to power tools.</p><p>It's hundreds of different changes across the different categories that we believe takes existing and new customers and give them a more efficient and better shopping experience.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. So I recently visited -- I guess it was earlier this year, I was with Tractor Supply team now in your headquarters, we walked your store. So I took note of the tool craft. I mean, the power tools what's always amazing is how good job you do, whatever merchandising tailoring specifically to the customer you're going after. So I guess how -- what else are we seeing from a merchandising perspective? Are there other -- as you continue to understand your consumer better, and you made the comment coming out of pandemic, now you have a bigger consumer base. What are your key merchandising changes that are allowing you to capture more share of wallet from this core consumer?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. It's -- I'd say for merchants, it's an exciting time because the last 3 years, you've really just been navigating macroeconomic environment between supply chain disruption and cost inflation. And now that we're getting back to a steady state on those as a merchant, it's a great time because you can really start line reviews back up, innovation, bringing in new products, new brands and really start to get back to like the core and the fund is on merchandising.</p><p>And the team is doing a great job on that. If you look in the last, call it, 12 months in our apparel area, we've really broadened our assortment with brands like Columbia, starting to bring them in and expanded in pet. We brought in a new brand called Victor for us. That's become a significant brand in animal. In horse feed we brought in a couple of years ago, Triple Crown.</p><p>And really now we carry every horse brand out there. And we're the only player that has all the top 5 equine feeds out there. And power tools, to your point, over the last couple of years, we'll be able to bring in Makita. We've been able to bring in Bosch and Dremel, tailoring the products we carry for them to Life Out Here, doing things like cutting things cutting metal and steel and welding and working on fences and stuff.</p><p>We've been bringing in a battery-powered product both in power tools more and more but also in outdoor power. One of the ones we're really excited about is a great partner of ours is Bad Boy Mowers. They're one of the top riding lawn mower brands out there. We worked with them over the last 12 months, introduced a battery power lineup, outdoor power with them. We're carrying that exclusively this year.</p><p>It's doing fantastic. So just a lot of fun -- a lot of great stuff coming in innovation across the business. Another 1 that I'm very excited about is poultry is folks may not be aware, we are -- we sell live birds for about 6 months out of the year, dominantly chickens, but also ducks and turkeys and pheasants and other things, but dominantly chickens.</p><p>We sell them for like $3 a piece, $4 a piece. We sell $11 million of them in a year. So on a revenue just attributable to chickens, it's a small dollar amount and immaterial, but it's everything that we sell around the project that becomes a large driver of our sales and we brought in a lot of new organic chicken feeds this year and those things, even in spite of them being more expensive than mid and opening price point product.</p><p>It's our highest performing area of growth in chicken feed right now. It's an organic chicken feed, and that's a brand-new product that we work with Purina on this year. So really excited about all the new innovation that's coming into our stores and also just the opportunity to continue to ramp that up now that we've gotten back to a more normalized supply chain and kind of vendor relationships.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Great. I do want to shift because another key real, I think, in my mind, a real key attribute, if you will, the Tractor Supply investment stories, the continued successful new store growth, new store expansion. So maybe we can talk about just the growth plans. I mean, kind of what -- where are your opening stores, the duration of the openings? And then I think it was just recently, you opened -- you launched a new distribution center.</p><p>So the question I have there is, how do you think about the Tractor Supply operating model? To what extent or how many stores in the operating model basically support over time?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I'll start on the store growth and then hit the DCs second. And then just talk about the collective infrastructure, the advantage I think that gives us. First, on the store front, we participate in a $180 billion total addressable market. .</p><p>And again, using round numbers at $15 billion, right, that's putting us at like an 8% -- 7%, 8% market share. So a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow even in spite of the growth we've had over the last 30, 35 years and the pronounced growth we've had over the last 4.</p><p>And we dominantly go after that opportunity with new stores as well as obviously driving productivity in our existing stores. Our current long-term store target is 2,800. We have approximately 2,200 right now counting the Orscheln stores that were in the process of converting.</p><p>So we've got about 600 left to go. We have historically built 70 to 80 a year. So we've got a good 8- to 10-year run rate ahead of us on new store builds. Our new stores continue to be very productive. The last several cohorts of new stores have exceeded the business plans that we approved before stores built. We're very pleased with the performance, the returns they're profitable in the first year.</p><p>Strong return prospects. And we're very pleased with the opportunity that's ahead of us on the new stores. The second piece is around our distribution centers. Historically, we've opened a new DC for every, call it, 200 to 300 stores. And as you did the math, our historic average store volume would have been around $4.5 million. So about every $1 billion of sales, we would add a new distribution center.</p><p>Well, we grew nearly $7 billion, $8 billion in sales over the last handful of years with no distribution centers. And so the team had to do a lot of things to drive capacity through our business and increase our capacity. We went 24/7 in all of our facilities and opened up the capacity there.</p><p>We, like many other companies, had to go out and use 3PLs to do pop-up DCs and create some extra space near our core distribution centers we had. We opened up mixing centers, and we now have 15 mixing centers, which are cross dock facilities. And we just opened up our ninth DC. We made the decision to build that DC in July of 2020.</p><p>So right in the midst of the pandemic when we saw our sales accelerating, but it takes 18 months to get 1 open and so we opened up the first 1 here in January, and we've got another 1 in the pipeline that will open up in the first quarter -- in the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of next year.</p><p>And so good to bringing back -- getting back to a more normalized distribution network allows us to take the cost out of the 3PLs where we're inefficient and also to lower our freight cost because we're placing the DCs that are closer to the stores they serve, and we're able to bring down our freight -- our mileage.</p><p>But more broadly, if I step back, we are the largest player in the vast majority of the markets that we participate, particularly in animal feed, and we're the largest retailer for our customers -- I mean, for our vendors, particularly in the categories of animal feed.</p><p>Last year, we moved over 8 billion pounds of food and feed. We have a supply chain built for our business that's built for our business at scale. It's co-located with our core manufacturers on the pet and animal side to minimize freight costs, and it's an ecosystem that is absolutely the lowest cost to serve in the business.</p><p>And that creates a lot of competitive advantages for us and ones that we'll leverage as we continue to move forward and just grow our business and continue to be the leader in our market.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. And I want to talk just a bit about it, and Hal, you mentioned obviously the supply chain. I think what we're seeing now across consumer, across retail is easing supply chain disruptions, shipping overseas shipping costs have moderated significantly from the pandemic highs. If I look at Tractor Supply, you, as a company we're very, very skilled at a -- strategically passalong inflation to consumers kind of picking your spots, if you will.</p><p>As we head into what was likely to be a less inflationary more disinflationary environment, how does that change? How does that change the thinking of Tractor Supply? And I guess the question I'm asking is if inflation has been a driver of sales growth without inflation to sales growth moderate, do you expect to see improved unit demand, any benefits on the margin side?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I get 4 points on this, Brian, real quickly. The first is, if you look back over the last 4 years, the collective body of work we've had with outsized growth, right, in kind of the 80% revenue growth over the last 4 years, Q1 '19 to Q1 '23, about half of that has been driven by transactions and about half of that has been driven by average ticket.</p><p>So 1 thing I would call out different than a lot of retailers over the last 4 years that really benefited mostly from an average ticket growth whether it's because of discretionary spend or just inflation. Even though we benefited from inflation, it's been -- we also had a really good story on transactions over the collective 4 years.</p><p>To your point, on inflation over the last 18 months, seen significant amount of inflation. And the team has done a nice job navigating the market to be able to maintain margins and navigate price with our customers at the same time and still be kind of the price setter in the market.</p><p>The third thing is as we do well in periods of volatility. We don't see deflation on the near-term horizon. But if it were to occur, we would be very comfortable navigating in it. When you're the largest player in your market, and you set price on the vast majority of the categories that matter to our customer, we're able to -- and also we're the largest retailer with our vendor partners. We're able to navigate costs with them, navigate wind pricing will moderate. And then typically, in periods of volatility, we're able to grow gross margin and typically grow gross margin dollars as well along the way just because we've got the scale on the cost side and the ability to navigate the retail side.</p><p>So just like we navigated it well on the way up, it appeared of disinflation or deflation, we would be able to navigate it the other way very well. Long term, we expect our business to continue to be a nice blend of comp transactions and average ticket. And when we think about our long-term comp targets, that's what's implied.</p><p>It's a nice blend. We've historically grown 50% of our growth ticket, 50% of our growth comp transactions. That's even in the collective body to work over the last 4 years, how it's been, and that's what we expect moving forward.</p><p>When we gave an update on our Q2 performance, we mentioned we were at mid-single-digit comps 4 weeks into the quarter and low single-digit comps on comp transactions. And so just use that as a proxy or indicative of how we expect to come back into a more balanced growth as we move forward.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Very helpful. And I know our time is running down here. So maybe the final topic I wanted to address is Tractor Supply has been a great generator of cash. You strategically use that cash or excess cash to return that cash to shareholders. So I guess, just update us there. I mean, is the kind of the cash flow prospects of the company and your philosophy towards the redistribution of excess capital?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON: Yes, Brian, you're right. I mean we definitely had a history of strong, consistent operating cash flow and our outlook long-range plans show that to be consistent and continue to grow. So we'll produce roughly $1.5 billion of operating cash flow targeted for 2023. It's -- we expect that to grow in line or even at or greater pace than the overall growth of the business.</p><p>And so that allows us to do is continue to execute on our growth strategy. So open new stores, continue the path on the existing store remodels, new distribution centers. And as you've seen from our long-range plans and targets, some years heavier than others, but roughly $650 million, $750 million in capital into the business, 80% of that towards growth drivers of the company.</p><p>And if you think about the whole allocation of capital, on $1.5 billion if you're taking the $750 million in capital investment into the business, that leaves still half of that and more to return back to shareholders. I can't talk about cash allocation without even our capital and we just secured and fixed all of our debt, any remaining variable is fixed with the recent bond offering.</p><p>So we've got a strong balance sheet. We target a 2:0 leverage ratio. So we can -- as the company grows, we continue to grow into the capital structure. So it really leaves us about $1 billion of cash that we allocate toward return to capital, continues to target removing net roughly 2% of shares from the market and our share repurchases and to continue a consistent strong dividend of 40% payout means we'll grow dividend. We'll target it to grow in line with earnings and continue to have strong payout and dividend yield as well.</p><p>So we find it is a unique, but a really good balance between a heavy investment for growth, giving us ability to grab more of that $180 billion TAM, but then take that excess cash and also give that to our shareholders to continue what we believe is a really strong total shareholder return.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: I gave a notification that our time has run to an end. So I truly appreciate Tractor Supply being with us. Kurt, Hal, Mary Winn, thank you very much for your participation. We look forward to connecting again soon.</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Thanks, Brian, and thanks, everyone.</p><p>KURT D.

INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Well, good morning. Thank you all for joining us. So my name is Brian Nagel. I'm the senior equity research analyst here at Oppenheimer, covering consumer growth and e-commerce. So this is our 23rd Annual Oppenheimer Consumer Growth and E-Commerce Conference and we're once again holding the event virtually.</p><p>So we very much appreciate everyone's attendance. So I'm very pleased to have with us our -- I guess, my first presenting company of the day, Tractor Supply and the company's senior leadership team. So I'm just going to turn the call over quickly to Mary Winn, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, to introduce her team, and then we'll jump into the fireside chat. Mary Winn?</p><p>MARY WINN PILKINGTON, SVP OF IR &amp; PUBLIC RELATIONS, TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY: Thank you so much, Brian, and good morning, everyone. It's now my pleasure to have Hal Lawton, our CEO; and Kurt Barton, our CFO, on the call today. And we have all we enjoy talking about Tractor Supply and Life Out Here lifestyle. So Hal, I'll turn it over to you.</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY: Great. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here. For those who just quick guess [little bit] on Tractor Supply at 2,200 stores, 49 states, approximately $15 billion in revenues this year, our guidance, so a little above.</p><p>And we serve out -- the Life Out Here, as Mary Winn said. So most of our stores are an hour and further outside of major metropolitan areas and really all built to support that, that rural country suburban, farm ranch lifestyle from pet food and animal feed to apparel and tools and hardware and garden that. Pleasure to be with everybody today and look forward to the discussion.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Great. And we also have like Kurt Barton, as CFO, too. So this will be structured as an informal fireside chat. I'll be asking questions and then Tractor Supply team will be answering those questions. To the extent there are questions from the audience, I shoot them through the chat, and I'll be happy to work them into our conversation.</p><p>So gentlemen, look, I think at least I'm going to start just the conversation. One of the questions I get a lot from our clients, and that is going to sound pretty basic to those who know Tractor Supply, but more for the benefit of those who are maybe less familiar to the story. And Hal, you've mentioned this a bit in your opening there, but who is your customer? Who does Tractor Supply serve? And we want to understand how this -- how you serve well a very differentiated consumer? And then to what extent has that consumer base expanded here either through the pandemic or over in length of time?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. Great place to start. I'd add, we serve Life Out Here, as I mentioned earlier. And our business has been around for 85 years. And we've spent those 85 years year after year, carefully curating 1 piece at a time the right business model to serve Life Out Here.</p><p>That starts with an 18,000 square foot selling space store. So not so large like a big box where you kind of lose productivity, not so small, let's say, like the equivalent of like 3,000 or 4,000 square foot as hardware where you're going to unable to really scale.</p><p>So the right kind of 15,000 to 20,000 square foot selling square foot box, provides convenience in and out, easy parking, but big enough where you can scale your productivity, then the assortment inside of carefully over time, curated the space allocated to that assortment, the type of assortment, the categories, but all really to serve Life Out Here.</p><p>So if you live in kind of country suburbia, rural America, you're a farmer, if you're a rancher or like we are, in many ways, your grocery store, we're your one-stop shop. Over 85% of our customers have pets and animals. So we have -- in animals, we have over 20% market share in animal feed in America.</p><p>And so far and away, the largest animal feed seller likely in the United -- the world from a [bad feed] perspective. And so poultry to chicken and equine and horse and cattle and just livestock feed in general, pet food, we're talking big 40-, 50-pound bags, not 5-pound bags, 10-pound bags because these -- our average customer has more than 2 pets, multiple animals, right?</p><p>When they're coming into our stores, they're stocking up on these large bags. And then we -- that's the kind of main traffic drivers. And then you've got apparel, which is mostly a workwear-type thing. So think Ariat boots, muck boots, work boots, work gloves, denim jeans, Carhartt, Columbia, things you need for Life Out Here, whether you're working out in your field, your pasture, on your farm or going to the local Applebee's for dinner on a Friday night.</p><p>Then we also sell a ton of truck tool and hardware. Majority of our sales there in things like trailers and truck boxes. Certainly, we sell power tools and hardware that are used for thing -- activities like fencing and welding, just about all of our customers have a welder somewhere in their home.</p><p>And then certainly, garden, riding lawn mowers because all of our customers have large lawns. And so we're the, if not one of the largest riding lawn mowers sellers in the United States, but also things like fertilizer and grass seed and certainly, those sorts of things that people need for multiple acres of land. But all carefully curated. And the origins of our business really came up out of the farm and ranch industry sector.</p><p>And what we've done is really expand the concept to a broader set of consumers that had historically been the kind of more narrow farm and ranch. We don't have a large national competitor that we compete with head to head. It's really more local market based. It might be a local co-op or it could be a farm mom-and-pop or a regional or a local player.</p><p>We certainly, at a national level, compete against category-specific retailers depending on the category, pet specialty and pad or grocery or maybe mass and pet and apparel, certainly, a whole variety of players. But no one at a national level competes kind of head-to-head with us on format as it relates to the format.</p><p>And then to your point, Brian is we started serving a more narrow and niche on farm and ranch. We've expanded our footprint, the categories we serve, the types of products. We've upgraded our store experience, particularly through our Fusion remodels and we've invited a whole another set of customers out who want to experience Life Out Here particularly the millennial generation.</p><p>And to that end, we've had significant customer growth over the last 4 years that's really expanded the base of Tractor Supply and been a large part of what's driven our -- on a 4-year basis in Q1 '19 to Q1 '23, 80% revenue growth.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Well, that's a great opening. Hal, I think it's a great flavor for your unique business. There's 1 topic I want to address before we really jump into the heart of everything that went on Tractor Supply. I know it's on the minds of investors, and it's unfortunately the weather. Last week, we heard from Tractor Supply when you report your first quarter results back in April.</p><p>And look, those of us who stayed your business for a long time, we know that you are susceptible, so to say, to weather variations through is particularly as a season chain. So that was a topic then. So I guess the question I want to ask is, how are you thinking about the weather now? When I look outside how the window does see more spring-like and how the Tractor Supply is basically performing against this weather backdrop?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I'll start out by kind of breaking our business into 3 buckets for the sake of the group on today's call and provide a little perspective there, then get into maybe a more near-term perspective. So one way to think about our business is in 3 buckets of kind of merchandising categories are consumable, usable and edible products.</p><p>And we aggregate products from across the business and lump them into this group. But think about them as almost like the grocery store products in our stores, animal feed, pet food, things like propane, wood pellets. These are things that are consumable. Our customers need them on a day in, day out basis.</p><p>That is well over the majority of our business and is a very stable business. And it's one we've grown over the last 5 to 10 years in an outsized way to lessen our reliance on weather-related products. And that business has been outperforming our total comp sales by 3 and 4x for the last probably 5, 6 quarters now and continues to do so.</p><p>We're gaining share in pet food. We're gaining share in animal feed. Those are very consistent products. People have to feed their pets and animals. And if we've learned anything in past downturns, they typically feed their pets and animals and take care of their kids before they do anything else.</p><p>The second piece of our business, which is only of around 15% is discretionary. So it's a small piece of our business. Things like gun safes, riding lawn mowers, trailers, these are bigger ticket items. There is a repair -- there is a replaced component to it, but there's also a discretionary component to it.</p><p>Those have been running kind of negative low double digits for the last 4 quarters, counting the 1 we're in, we'd already indicated that, that was our expectation here for Q2. And the big swing in our business is always the seasonal. It's less than half of our business. It varies anywhere from 30% to 40% depending on the quarter that we're in.</p><p>And like if you look at last year, Q2 and Q3 were okay. And so we were kind of at the lower is middle end of our comp range. Q4 was outstanding, and we ended up with over an 8% comp because we had really strong weather in Q4 last year. Q2 was -- I mean, Q1 of this year was difficult weather. And so we're kind of on the low side of our comp expectations, in fact, a little bit lower than that.</p><p>So just the swing on our comp from quarter-to-quarter is really the seasonal business with the Q business driving very sustained footsteps and comp transactions into our stores. And so there's a few weeks left here in the quarter, so I'm hesitant to say too much. But what I'd say is that if you look at the weather patterns, it was fine -- good in April.</p><p>The first couple of weeks in May, so the last couple of weeks of May, good. We had a Canadian forest fire that blanketed half of east of the Mississippi last week that kept some people from going outside. It was this back half of this week is looking very nice. So we'll see how it plays out. But the thing is that I think is the great thing about our business is we're demand-driven, we're needs-based. The vast majority of our business is consumable, usable product.</p><p>It's what's driving to sustain footsteps into our stores. It's what's driving our growth as a company and it's a very consistent, reliable component of our business. And it's why we continue to have positive comps when a lot of retail has gone negative, we've had positive comp continue to -- we're having positive comp transactions even in the context of where we are now, which most retailers are not having. So even in spite of the ebbs and flows of seasonality, this is a very attractive business, I would assert.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Very helpful, Hal. So let's jump, you mentioned in one of your comments about Fusion is we talked a lot about some of the internal initiatives that are happening within the existing capacity of Tractor Supply, so Fusion be one, what you're doing in your side lots and Kurt, I'd love to get you in the conversation as well. But so maybe just update the audience on these internal efforts, kind of where we are and the benefits we're starting to see.</p><p>The other thing I know, Kurt, you and I have had this conversation, but as you think about the near-term, intermediate-term comp algorithm, how much of the comps of Tractor Supply are coming from these internal initiatives as they're enhancing the productivity of your stores?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON, EXECUTIVE VP, CFO &amp; TREASURER, TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY: Yes. Good morning, everybody, and thanks, Brian, for the question. We've said that Fusion and our Side Lot Garden Centers are a key part of our opportunity to continue to grow our market share in this large $180 billion TAM. And it's the 1 area in live goods and Garden Centers that our customers told us that I engage in this hobby, it's a need or a part of our lifestyle that you modestly serve or underserved me.</p><p>And so it's from the beginning of launching it and our Life Out Here strategy, it was a key aspect of it. And today, we're roughly at 30% of our chain today has the Fusion reset remodel, and we're on a 5-, 6-year path of converting the entire chain.</p><p>Our goal of converting and renovating the Side Lot to have Garden Centers, feed rooms, drive-through and just turning that previous storage space for large ag equipment into a true shopping experience, we believe we've got the opportunity for roughly 2/3 of our chain to have that.</p><p>The biggest inhibitor for 100% is that if you've shopped our stores, we've got some great legacy stores that either don't have an attached Side Lot, don't have the space to be able to put that in, but it's a tremendous opportunity to be able to put that additional selling space and meet an area of our customers' needs. And so we're moving in that pace. We're roughly 15% of the chain with Garden Centers and Side Lot. We'll be reaching over 20% by the end of the year on that.</p><p>And again, on our path, we've said and seen through the results of 2022 and first half of 2023, the [smart] continue to prove the early indications that a Fusion-only store against an existing control group sees in the first 12 months, a mid-single-digit incremental lever.</p><p>If it's a combined combo store of both Fusion and Side Lot, high single-digit growth on incremental comp sales over its control group. The Fusion stores, in particular, would have most of their lift, say, in the first 12, 24 months for Garden Centers as you -- it draws in new customers. It allows customers to come in and then see the other 4 corners of the store.</p><p>Early indications, our belief, our model is that those combo stores have a maturity curve on their growth cycle. Yes, it's high single digits in the first year of the store, but there's still an outpaced growth as customers mature in the other categories for Tractor Supply. So our models, our belief is there's at least like a 3-year maturation curve on incremental sales.</p><p>And what that basically does if you -- we look at it as a 10-year investment and a 10-year return on invested capital, and the growth that we got on the investments we've got in both Fusion and the Garden Centers, are really giving us a return on investment consistent with the chain return on invested capital and a very productive at or above what investment you get in the first few years of a new store.</p><p>So you can see our excitement of take this additional capital and gain incremental sales while opening new stores and making the existing stores more productive.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. Kurt, if I can just follow up. So just from a consumer's perspective, when a store goes Fusion or when the Fusion update is, what do I see? What are the changes in that store?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON: Yes. For us, on Fusion, it's principally inside the store when you refer to Fusion. But the customer is going to see a significant change, especially like right when you walk in the store, the legacy store had cash registers, your old style cash registers right there. You're going to have a team member there, but you're going to have a lot of the help desk in the service and a lot of the offerings in the back of the store.</p><p>We converted free up a help desk space. And now we have pallet drops of high-volume product that we're selling there and converted the front into that hub space where it's basically a very convenient checkout, but also all of the help desk right there in the front of the store, engaging your customer.</p><p>You're going to have wider aisles. You're going to have brighter signage in indicating all the areas of lawn and garden, et cetera. So for our new customer that wants that better, more open, bright shopping experience, they're getting that with the new Fusion.</p><p>We've seen that we are moving pet and animal feed at paces that the existing stores weren't able to handle efficiently. So now it's created pallet drop spaces. So we can internally move and handle product more efficiently, and it's more efficient customer experience.</p><p>Lastly, it gives us more space for the growing pet industry. We've definitely made a statement that we are here in outdoor power equipment and power tools. So it's given us now a whole extended tool corral with Makita and many other brands besides DEWALT and others that we've had. We're certainly making sure that the growing consumer, those that are even more of a professional and want the Makita that Tractor Supply is everything from basic to best in regards to power tools.</p><p>It's hundreds of different changes across the different categories that we believe takes existing and new customers and give them a more efficient and better shopping experience.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. So I recently visited -- I guess it was earlier this year, I was with Tractor Supply team now in your headquarters, we walked your store. So I took note of the tool craft. I mean, the power tools what's always amazing is how good job you do, whatever merchandising tailoring specifically to the customer you're going after. So I guess how -- what else are we seeing from a merchandising perspective? Are there other -- as you continue to understand your consumer better, and you made the comment coming out of pandemic, now you have a bigger consumer base. What are your key merchandising changes that are allowing you to capture more share of wallet from this core consumer?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. It's -- I'd say for merchants, it's an exciting time because the last 3 years, you've really just been navigating macroeconomic environment between supply chain disruption and cost inflation. And now that we're getting back to a steady state on those as a merchant, it's a great time because you can really start line reviews back up, innovation, bringing in new products, new brands and really start to get back to like the core and the fund is on merchandising.</p><p>And the team is doing a great job on that. If you look in the last, call it, 12 months in our apparel area, we've really broadened our assortment with brands like Columbia, starting to bring them in and expanded in pet. We brought in a new brand called Victor for us. That's become a significant brand in animal. In horse feed we brought in a couple of years ago, Triple Crown.</p><p>And really now we carry every horse brand out there. And we're the only player that has all the top 5 equine feeds out there. And power tools, to your point, over the last couple of years, we'll be able to bring in Makita. We've been able to bring in Bosch and Dremel, tailoring the products we carry for them to Life Out Here, doing things like cutting things cutting metal and steel and welding and working on fences and stuff.</p><p>We've been bringing in a battery-powered product both in power tools more and more but also in outdoor power. One of the ones we're really excited about is a great partner of ours is Bad Boy Mowers. They're one of the top riding lawn mower brands out there. We worked with them over the last 12 months, introduced a battery power lineup, outdoor power with them. We're carrying that exclusively this year.</p><p>It's doing fantastic. So just a lot of fun -- a lot of great stuff coming in innovation across the business. Another 1 that I'm very excited about is poultry is folks may not be aware, we are -- we sell live birds for about 6 months out of the year, dominantly chickens, but also ducks and turkeys and pheasants and other things, but dominantly chickens.</p><p>We sell them for like $3 a piece, $4 a piece. We sell $11 million of them in a year. So on a revenue just attributable to chickens, it's a small dollar amount and immaterial, but it's everything that we sell around the project that becomes a large driver of our sales and we brought in a lot of new organic chicken feeds this year and those things, even in spite of them being more expensive than mid and opening price point product.</p><p>It's our highest performing area of growth in chicken feed right now. It's an organic chicken feed, and that's a brand-new product that we work with Purina on this year. So really excited about all the new innovation that's coming into our stores and also just the opportunity to continue to ramp that up now that we've gotten back to a more normalized supply chain and kind of vendor relationships.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Great. I do want to shift because another key real, I think, in my mind, a real key attribute, if you will, the Tractor Supply investment stories, the continued successful new store growth, new store expansion. So maybe we can talk about just the growth plans. I mean, kind of what -- where are your opening stores, the duration of the openings? And then I think it was just recently, you opened -- you launched a new distribution center.</p><p>So the question I have there is, how do you think about the Tractor Supply operating model? To what extent or how many stores in the operating model basically support over time?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I'll start on the store growth and then hit the DCs second. And then just talk about the collective infrastructure, the advantage I think that gives us. First, on the store front, we participate in a $180 billion total addressable market. .</p><p>And again, using round numbers at $15 billion, right, that's putting us at like an 8% -- 7%, 8% market share. So a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow even in spite of the growth we've had over the last 30, 35 years and the pronounced growth we've had over the last 4.</p><p>And we dominantly go after that opportunity with new stores as well as obviously driving productivity in our existing stores. Our current long-term store target is 2,800. We have approximately 2,200 right now counting the Orscheln stores that were in the process of converting.</p><p>So we've got about 600 left to go. We have historically built 70 to 80 a year. So we've got a good 8- to 10-year run rate ahead of us on new store builds. Our new stores continue to be very productive. The last several cohorts of new stores have exceeded the business plans that we approved before stores built. We're very pleased with the performance, the returns they're profitable in the first year.</p><p>Strong return prospects. And we're very pleased with the opportunity that's ahead of us on the new stores. The second piece is around our distribution centers. Historically, we've opened a new DC for every, call it, 200 to 300 stores. And as you did the math, our historic average store volume would have been around $4.5 million. So about every $1 billion of sales, we would add a new distribution center.</p><p>Well, we grew nearly $7 billion, $8 billion in sales over the last handful of years with no distribution centers. And so the team had to do a lot of things to drive capacity through our business and increase our capacity. We went 24/7 in all of our facilities and opened up the capacity there.</p><p>We, like many other companies, had to go out and use 3PLs to do pop-up DCs and create some extra space near our core distribution centers we had. We opened up mixing centers, and we now have 15 mixing centers, which are cross dock facilities. And we just opened up our ninth DC. We made the decision to build that DC in July of 2020.</p><p>So right in the midst of the pandemic when we saw our sales accelerating, but it takes 18 months to get 1 open and so we opened up the first 1 here in January, and we've got another 1 in the pipeline that will open up in the first quarter -- in the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter of next year.</p><p>And so good to bringing back -- getting back to a more normalized distribution network allows us to take the cost out of the 3PLs where we're inefficient and also to lower our freight cost because we're placing the DCs that are closer to the stores they serve, and we're able to bring down our freight -- our mileage.</p><p>But more broadly, if I step back, we are the largest player in the vast majority of the markets that we participate, particularly in animal feed, and we're the largest retailer for our customers -- I mean, for our vendors, particularly in the categories of animal feed.</p><p>Last year, we moved over 8 billion pounds of food and feed. We have a supply chain built for our business that's built for our business at scale. It's co-located with our core manufacturers on the pet and animal side to minimize freight costs, and it's an ecosystem that is absolutely the lowest cost to serve in the business.</p><p>And that creates a lot of competitive advantages for us and ones that we'll leverage as we continue to move forward and just grow our business and continue to be the leader in our market.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: That's great. And I want to talk just a bit about it, and Hal, you mentioned obviously the supply chain. I think what we're seeing now across consumer, across retail is easing supply chain disruptions, shipping overseas shipping costs have moderated significantly from the pandemic highs. If I look at Tractor Supply, you, as a company we're very, very skilled at a -- strategically passalong inflation to consumers kind of picking your spots, if you will.</p><p>As we head into what was likely to be a less inflationary more disinflationary environment, how does that change? How does that change the thinking of Tractor Supply? And I guess the question I'm asking is if inflation has been a driver of sales growth without inflation to sales growth moderate, do you expect to see improved unit demand, any benefits on the margin side?</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Yes. I get 4 points on this, Brian, real quickly. The first is, if you look back over the last 4 years, the collective body of work we've had with outsized growth, right, in kind of the 80% revenue growth over the last 4 years, Q1 '19 to Q1 '23, about half of that has been driven by transactions and about half of that has been driven by average ticket.</p><p>So 1 thing I would call out different than a lot of retailers over the last 4 years that really benefited mostly from an average ticket growth whether it's because of discretionary spend or just inflation. Even though we benefited from inflation, it's been -- we also had a really good story on transactions over the collective 4 years.</p><p>To your point, on inflation over the last 18 months, seen significant amount of inflation. And the team has done a nice job navigating the market to be able to maintain margins and navigate price with our customers at the same time and still be kind of the price setter in the market.</p><p>The third thing is as we do well in periods of volatility. We don't see deflation on the near-term horizon. But if it were to occur, we would be very comfortable navigating in it. When you're the largest player in your market, and you set price on the vast majority of the categories that matter to our customer, we're able to -- and also we're the largest retailer with our vendor partners. We're able to navigate costs with them, navigate wind pricing will moderate. And then typically, in periods of volatility, we're able to grow gross margin and typically grow gross margin dollars as well along the way just because we've got the scale on the cost side and the ability to navigate the retail side.</p><p>So just like we navigated it well on the way up, it appeared of disinflation or deflation, we would be able to navigate it the other way very well. Long term, we expect our business to continue to be a nice blend of comp transactions and average ticket. And when we think about our long-term comp targets, that's what's implied.</p><p>It's a nice blend. We've historically grown 50% of our growth ticket, 50% of our growth comp transactions. That's even in the collective body to work over the last 4 years, how it's been, and that's what we expect moving forward.</p><p>When we gave an update on our Q2 performance, we mentioned we were at mid-single-digit comps 4 weeks into the quarter and low single-digit comps on comp transactions. And so just use that as a proxy or indicative of how we expect to come back into a more balanced growth as we move forward.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: Very helpful. And I know our time is running down here. So maybe the final topic I wanted to address is Tractor Supply has been a great generator of cash. You strategically use that cash or excess cash to return that cash to shareholders. So I guess, just update us there. I mean, is the kind of the cash flow prospects of the company and your philosophy towards the redistribution of excess capital?</p><p>KURT D. BARTON: Yes, Brian, you're right. I mean we definitely had a history of strong, consistent operating cash flow and our outlook long-range plans show that to be consistent and continue to grow. So we'll produce roughly $1.5 billion of operating cash flow targeted for 2023. It's -- we expect that to grow in line or even at or greater pace than the overall growth of the business.</p><p>And so that allows us to do is continue to execute on our growth strategy. So open new stores, continue the path on the existing store remodels, new distribution centers. And as you've seen from our long-range plans and targets, some years heavier than others, but roughly $650 million, $750 million in capital into the business, 80% of that towards growth drivers of the company.</p><p>And if you think about the whole allocation of capital, on $1.5 billion if you're taking the $750 million in capital investment into the business, that leaves still half of that and more to return back to shareholders. I can't talk about cash allocation without even our capital and we just secured and fixed all of our debt, any remaining variable is fixed with the recent bond offering.</p><p>So we've got a strong balance sheet. We target a 2:0 leverage ratio. So we can -- as the company grows, we continue to grow into the capital structure. So it really leaves us about $1 billion of cash that we allocate toward return to capital, continues to target removing net roughly 2% of shares from the market and our share repurchases and to continue a consistent strong dividend of 40% payout means we'll grow dividend. We'll target it to grow in line with earnings and continue to have strong payout and dividend yield as well.</p><p>So we find it is a unique, but a really good balance between a heavy investment for growth, giving us ability to grab more of that $180 billion TAM, but then take that excess cash and also give that to our shareholders to continue what we believe is a really strong total shareholder return.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAM NAGEL: I gave a notification that our time has run to an end. So I truly appreciate Tractor Supply being with us. Kurt, Hal, Mary Winn, thank you very much for your participation. We look forward to connecting again soon.</p><p>HARRY A. LAWTON: Thanks, Brian, and thanks, everyone.</p><p>KURT D.

The project is accessible year-round via a 15 minute drive on a paved highway which runs the length of the northern claim boundary and a network of well-maintained logging roads.</p><p>The Dixie Project hosts two principal styles of gold mineralization:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">High-grade gold in quartz veins and silica-sulphide replacement zones (Dixie Limb, Hinge and Arrow zones). Hosted by mafic volcanic rocks and localized near regional-scale D2 fold axes. These mineralization styles are also typical of the significant mined deposits of the Red Lake district. High-grade disseminated gold with broad moderate to lower grade envelopes (LP Fault). The LP Fault is a significant gold-hosting structure which has been seismically imaged to extend to 14 kilometres depth (Zeng and Calvert, 2006), and has been interpreted by Great Bear to have up to 18 kilometres of strike length on the Dixie property. High-grade gold mineralization is controlled by structural and geological contacts, and moderate to lower-grade disseminated gold surrounds and flanks the high-grade intervals. The dominant gold-hosting stratigraphy consists of felsic sediments and volcanic units.</emphasis></p><p>About Great Bear</p><p>Great Bear Resources Ltd.\u00a0is a well-financed gold exploration company managed by a team with a track record of success in mineral exploration.\u00a0 Great Bear is focused in the prolific Red Lake gold district in northwest Ontario, where the company controls over 200 km2 of highly prospective tenure across 4 projects, all 100% owned: The flagship Dixie Project, the Pakwash Property, the Sobel Property, and the Red Lake North Property, all of which are accessible year-round through existing roads.</p><p>Qualified Person and NI 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>Mr. R.

On Feb. 11, 1958, Deehr was a student at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He asked a Fulbright student from Norway named Tone to the Portland Symphony that night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They went for a stroll on a golf course after the concert. Looking past the treetops, they noticed the sky was blood red.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People as far south as Mexico saw the red sky that night. Some thought Martians. Others thought Christ was visiting for the second time. In Portland, people thought a forest fire was causing the glow.</p><p>Deehr knew better, because he was studying the physics of Earth and space. Under the crimson sky, he was sure of two things: he and Tone were seeing a great red aurora, and he would ask her on another date.</p><p>The Deehrs have now been married 61 years. Charles - Chuck to his friends - was a space-physicist and aurora forecaster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks for most of that time. In decades of sky-watching in the north, he has seen a few red auroras, but not many.</p><p>Fringes of red and blue hanging from aurora curtains - the result of particles from the sun reacting with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere - happen often, but the great displays that flood the sky with diffuse red light are rare.</p><p>Red aurora displays happen so high in the sky that they are often the only form of aurora ever seen by people in the mid-latitudes.</p><p>In A.D. 37, a great red aurora showed itself to the citizens of Rome. Those in London gazed up at a red sky in September 1839. A blazing display in 1938 lit the sands of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa. Deehr and his date witnessed one of the most spectacular displays in 1958. Others have happened in 1989, 2000 and 2001.</p><p>Great red auroras are rare because they require a perfect mix of heavenly conditions.</p><p>\"To get a pure red aurora, you need two things from the sun,\" Deehr said. \"Lots of solar flares with ultraviolet radiation to heat the Earth's atmosphere, and lots of coronal mass ejections to power the Earth's magnetospheric generator of aurora.\"</p><p>The green aurora that northerners enjoy almost every dark night is a product of particles cast off by the sun that stream outward into space. This solar wind takes a day to two to reach Earth. It flows over the planet and reacts with Earth's magnetic field. In the upper atmosphere, this electrical discharge reacts with gases, causing them to glow in the same way electricity fires up a neon light.</p><p>Green auroras occur at about 60 miles above Earth. Pure red auroras are much higher, from about 200 to 300 miles up, which allows people closer to the equator to see them. An important gas remaining at that altitude is oxygen, and electrons that excite the oxygen atoms there produce a red light as pure as a laser.</p><p>Cameras and phones that can capture more light wavelengths than our eyes sometimes show red in aurora photos in which the photographer only saw greens. Red auroras have to be 10 times as bright as green auroras for us to see that color with the naked eye.</p><p>Red auroras are unpredictable, but in the past they have tended to bunch themselves around periods when the solar cycle - an 11-year period of sun activity - features lots of solar activity.</p><p>Today, Chuck Deehr is a professor emeritus at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He doesn't expect to ever see a red aurora as brilliant as the night of Feb. 11, 1958, but some things - like a first date that leads to a 63-year partnership, four daughters and seven grandchildren - happen only once in a lifetime.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/resizer/MHj2--o7kTdfpVmQzNsd0YfKv3g=/800x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/Z7YFYMI4PFDDJEC6SXG6XF3RL4.jpg\">See image link</url><br/>A rare red aurora over Alaska in February 1958.

These airports also provide essential air services, more so during this Covid-19 pandemic, including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at airports in Saskatchewan.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide over $3.3 million to the following Saskatchewan airports for safety-related projects:</p><p>La Ronge</p><p>* Purchase of a wet/dry material spreader - $110,700</p><p>Prince Albert</p><p>* Rehabilitation of the airfield electrical system - $3,211,884</p><p>* Improvements to airfield drainage - $58,812</p><p>For 2021-2022, Transport Canada has allocated ACAP funding to 63 airports for 86 safety-related projects, including runway and taxiway repairs/rehabilitation, lighting enhancements, purchasing snow clearing equipment and firefighting vehicles and installing wildlife fencing.</p><p>Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.1 billion for 1,088 projects at 199 airports across the country.</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"We know how vital airports are to urban centres and remote communities. The investment our government is making will help ensure continued safe and reliable airport operations for residents, many of whom depend on their local airports not only for personal travel and business, but also for community resupply of essential goods and access to routine and emergency medical care in larger centres. This is part of how we build stronger more resilient and inclusive communities across Canada.\"</p><p>The Honourable Jim Carr, Minister and Special Representative for the Prairies</p><p>\"Our Government recognizes that airports are major contributors to the economic growth and social well-being of smaller communities, and local airport workers. In addition to supporting personal travel, local airports are key connectors for business, health care, social services, and emerging resource development sectors. These investments will improve access to safe, reliable and efficient air transportation options, and will help us deliver our promise to build safer, healthier and stronger communities across Canada. This is more important than ever as we work towards reopening our economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>The Honourable Omar Alghabra, Minister of Transport</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* As announced in the Fall Economic Statement (FES) 2020, the Airports Capital Assistance Program received a one-time funding top-up of $186 million over two years.</p><p>* As well, the FES announced the temporary expansion of eligibility for the Airports Capital Assistance Program to allow National Airport System (NAS) airports with less than one million annual passengers in 2019 to apply for funding under the Program in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023.</p><p>* The eligible NAS airports are: Gander;

On Feb. 11, 1958, Deehr was a student at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He asked a Fulbright student from Norway named Tone to the Portland Symphony that night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They went for a stroll on a golf course after the concert. Looking past the treetops, they noticed the sky was blood red.</p><p>People as far south as Mexico saw the red sky that night. Some thought Martians. Others thought Christ was visiting for the second time. In Portland, people thought a forest fire was causing the glow.</p><p>Deehr knew better, because he was studying the physics of Earth and space. Under the crimson sky, he was sure of two things: he and Tone were seeing a great red aurora, and he would ask her on another date.</p><p>The Deehrs have now been married 61 years. Charles \u2014 Chuck to his friends \u2014 was a space-physicist and aurora forecaster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks for most of that time. In decades of sky-watching in the north, he has seen a few red auroras, but not many.</p><p>Fringes of red and blue hanging from aurora curtains \u2014 the result of particles from the sun reacting with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere \u2014 happen often, but the great displays that flood the sky with diffuse red light are rare.</p><p>Red aurora displays happen so high in the sky they are often the only form of aurora ever seen by people in the mid-latitudes.</p><p>In A.D. 37, a great red aurora showed itself to the citizens of Rome. Those in London gazed up at a red sky in September 1839. A blazing display in 1938 lit the sands of the Sahara Desert in northern Africa. Deehr and his date witnessed one of the most spectacular displays in 1958. Others have happened in 1989, 2000 and 2001.</p><p>Great red auroras are rare because they require a perfect mix of heavenly conditions.</p><p>\"To get a pure red aurora, you need two things from the sun,\" Deehr said. \"Lots of solar flares with ultraviolet radiation to heat the Earth's atmosphere, and lots of coronal mass ejections to power the Earth's magnetospheric generator of aurora.\"</p><p>The green aurora northerners enjoy almost every dark night is a product of particles cast off by the sun that stream outward into space. This solar wind takes a day to two to reach Earth. It flows over the planet and reacts with Earth's magnetic field. In the upper atmosphere, this electrical discharge reacts with gases, causing them to glow in the same way electricity fires up a neon light.</p><p>Green auroras occur at about 60 miles above Earth. Pure red auroras are much higher, from about 200 to 300 miles up, which allows people closer to the equator to see them. An important gas remaining at that altitude is oxygen, and electrons that excite the oxygen atoms there produce a red light as pure as a laser.</p><p>Cameras and phones that can capture more light wavelengths than our eyes sometimes show red in aurora photos in which the photographer only saw greens. Red auroras have to be 10 times as bright as green auroras for us to see that color with the naked eye.</p><p>Red auroras are unpredictable, but in the past they have tended to bunch themselves around periods when the solar cycle \u2014 an 11-year period of sun activity \u2014 features lots of solar activity.</p><p>Today, Chuck Deehr is a professor emeritus at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He doesn't expect to ever see a red aurora as brilliant as the night of Feb. 11, 1958, but some things \u2014 like a first date that leads to a 63-year partnership, four daughters, and seven grandchildren \u2014 happen only once in a lifetime.</p><p>\u07e6 Since the late 1970s, the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Geophysical Institute has provided this column free in cooperation with the UAF research community. This year is the institute's 75th anniversary.

We've got all the latest on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Grain Deal gutted just hours after that bridge attack, the Kremlin announcing it will not extend. The crucial Black Sea grain agreement that provide safe passage for Ukraine's grain exports around the world. We've got a live report on that just ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, China's growth challenge the world's second largest economy growing by 0.8 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous one, watch the consumer too after retail sales disappointed and youth unemployment hit a record high of 21 percent. And remember, that's what the country's admitting too.</p><p>As you could imagine that provided a serious sentiment dent across the Asia stock market session SHANGHAI falling almost 1 percent, SEOUL finished in the red as you can see there too. Hong Kong was closed because of a typhoon while Tokyo was closed for a holiday.</p><p>So we'll have to see what catch up we see overnight and in Tuesday's session. In the meantime, here in New York, stock market futures are lower ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings stateside, including guidance from some of the nation's largest banks. It does however though follow a winning week last week on Wall Street, with the NASDAQ jumping more than 3 percent a busy show ahead as always.</p><p>We do begin in Ukraine and keep claiming responsibility for an explosion on the bridge over the Kerch Strait saying it was carried out by its security services in a joint operation with the Navy that according to a source. The Governor of Russia's Belgorod region says two people lost their lives.</p><p>The Kerch Bridge serves as a crucial supply route in Moscow's war effort, as Alex Marquardt reports.</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: This Bridge was opened back in 2018. Now, Ukraine is rather surprisingly claiming responsibility often they do not claim responsibility for these types of brazen attacks. But Kyiv was saying that it was its navy in a joint operation with the SBU that's the domestic security services that carried out this attack.</p><p>We believe it was around 3 am local time, according to Russian authorities, which have called this a terrorist attack. It was carried out by sea or surface drones. In terms of the destruction the roadway from pictures and video that we've seen was severely damaged and traffic came to a halt.</p><p>Parallel to that roadway, our train tracks and it appears that the trains have kept running. But with some delay, we have seen images coming from a train indicating that the trains are still running. This was a deadly attack. At least two adults were killed. That's according to an official in the Belgorod region.</p><p>We believe that they are parents and that their young child was injured but this is extraordinarily significant. This bridge opened in 2018, as I mentioned, it cost almost $4 billion to build. It was a personal project of President Vladimir Putin's, when the bridge was opened, he drove across it himself in a truck.</p><p>It spans around 12 miles or 19 kilometers. And then the last time there was an attack on this bridge in October, which mind you Ukraine did not claim. It resulted in a significant series of strikes, the heaviest strikes that we had seen from Russia against Ukraine since the war began.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And now to Russia's termination of the Black Sea Grain Deal under that agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey a year ago. Russia allowed Ukrainian ships carrying exports of grain to pass through its naval blockade. The effects of Moscow's withdrawal will be felt far beyond Ukraine and could once again have a significant impact on food prices worldwide.</p><p>Just to give you a sense of the reaction that we're already seeing the price of wheat up almost 3 percent currently. Anna Stewart joins us now. Anna, more details on why Russia was pulled out because they have been threatening, let us be clear for many weeks.</p><p>And they wanted access to be able to export their own goods in a more comprehensive manner. They didn't get the concessions they were asking for. And here we are.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, as you say it's unsurprising and as the Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said unrelated to the attack on the bridge yesterday, this was expected for some weeks. The deal was due to expire today. So what Russia would like is to see its exports unhindered by indirectly by social sanctions, whether it's pay payments, insurance and shipping.</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>But in terms of the exports of their grain, they want to see more on the table for that. So Peskov told reporters today, unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far. So its effect is terminated. Now, that does mean that there is some room here perhaps for negotiation.</p><p>Perhaps the deal can be resurrected if Western allies can find a way to reach an agreement that allows Russia to export more agricultural produce. Until it does though you I think we will see wheat prices elevated, as you said that already up nearly 3 percent today. And this comes after the U.N. actually said that food prices had fallen some 20 percent since March of last year from their peak prices.</p><p>And of course, this doesn't just impact Ukraine and its ability to export grains, wheat, and so on. It impacts all of those countries that exports to more than 50 percent are developing countries and global food prices. So if this deal isn't resurrected, we could see an elevated food price for some time to come. That impacts inflation interest rates the world over, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. I was about to say I'm actually surprised by the lack of reaction in wheat prices at this stage. But I think there's clearly some inbuilt optimism here that some kind of solution will be found in an extension provided. We'll see Anna, great to have you. Thank you, Anna Stewart there.</p><p>China's economic recovery losing steam the world's second largest economy expanding at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the second quarter slower than expected. However compared to the first quarter growth was a sluggish 0.8 percent. Marc Stewart joins us now I think most of us are dazed and confused by those numbers.</p><p>But the key here is the comparisons to what we've got in 2022, which flatter these numbers because that data was so poor. What's the story here in terms of the degree of slowing, Marc? How worried should we be and what more support from the government can we hope for?</p><p>MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Julia, I was thinking about our many conversations over the last few months about all of these different realities facing China. Well, they are certainly reflected in the data that we have seen today. And yes, these numbers seem to be staggering.</p><p>But consider it was one year ago under zero COVID lock downs where everything was pretty flat. So whatever we see, obviously, is going to be dramatic. But if we're talking about GDP, if we're talking about productivity and growth, in order to achieve that, you have to have money moving.</p><p>That can be through investment by business, it can be through consumer spending. And one way to do that is through stimulus. It's kind of been that true and tried a tool that we have seen in the pandemic in many economies around the world. So expect to see perhaps some calls here in China to do that.</p><p>I was looking at a memo sent out this morning, a note this morning from Deutsche Bank. And it was saying do not be surprised that these cries get louder to do stimulus to convince China to engage in stimulus, especially as the Politburo, the legislative body meets later this month.</p><p>So stimulus is going to be one key thing to look out for other things that are taking place and may have a bigger role, certainly our interest rate cut to something that we have seen from the Bank of China, the People's Bank of China, although as we have seen that does take patience.</p><p>Interesting to note that there are incentives now to get Chinese consumers to buy electric vehicles. As we've discussed, the EV market is something that's actually booming right now, in China. Also, we're going to go back to this theme in China about regulation and trying to ease some of the regulation specifically among tech companies.</p><p>We've seen a crackdown, we saw Premier Li Qiang have a meeting with tech companies, including Alibaba, including ByteDance. Also on this list is AI that is seen as a way to get new business going. There was a draft, as we've reported, have different regulations concerning AI in China.</p><p>Some of that has been relaxed. Again, China is really trying to make this environment friendly for both businesses and consumers. But despite everything that may be tried that is on the table, Julia, as you well know, the world is still facing economic uncertainty. And that could easily seep into the best made plans by China to try to revive things to get things going up once again.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I love the concept of providing money and following the financial flows and ultimately reaches the answers. But the problem here is they juice the economy with loan growth, which is a challenge. You can't go to the property sector now, because it's been a bubble that's essentially pop.</p><p>So looking for those levels of growth is so challenging. I like the technology angle as a way to achieve that. It's going to be interesting to see. Marc Stewart, thank you. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry landing in China amid searing heat on Sunday. Beijing the venue for crucial climate talks between the two largest economies and the two biggest polluters in the world.</p><p>[09:10:00]</p><p>They both say co-operation on climate is, key, but that's more or less been frozen amid severe political tensions. Anna Coren is in Hong Kong with more.</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry held a four hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinhua on the first official day of his trip to Beijing, in the hope to regain momentum on climate talks between the two superpowers.</p><p>Before the meeting, Xi said China is seeking substantial dialogue this week that could contribute to \"improving our bilateral relations\". The world's two largest economies are the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, accounting for 40 percent of global emissions.</p><p>And both sides realize the need for cooperation if they are to drastically cut fossil fuel production and ease global warming. Almost a year ago, climate talks between the U.S. and China came to a standstill. After then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, Beijing seven talks in protest.</p><p>But there have been a slew of high level meetings in the past month to improve this strained relationship, starting with U.S. Secretary of State, then the Treasury Secretary. Now U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry is in Beijing for talks. Kerry and Xi have history and have met more than 50 times.</p><p>They worked together in 2021 for COP26 in Glasgow where they made real progress. They then met on the sidelines of COP27 in Egypt of last year. Then in January of this year, the two talks via video link communications have continued despite strained relations.</p><p>This face to face meeting is important. It's about resuming their joint working group on climate cooperation before COP28 in Dubai at the end of November. Kerry said it was imperative that China and the U.S. make real progress in the next four months.</p><p>Kerry also said, in the next three days, we hope we can begin taking big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the U.S. to address a common risk, threat, and challenge to all of humanity created by humans themselves. Kerry will meet with other Chinese officials over the next few days possibly even Chinese Leader Xi Jinping.</p><p>Kerry and Xi met when he was U.S. Secretary of State under President Obama. Experts believe that meeting would send an important signal of Beijing's commitment to tackling global warming. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And speaking of that extreme floods record breaking temperatures and the risk of more Canadian wildfire smoke. That's the weather report from the United States where more than 35 temperature records were broken across the nation on Sunday, more than 80 million people in fact are facing dangerously high temperatures, as what's known as a heat dome remains locked over the western part of the nation.</p><p>California, Nevada and Arizona are seeing heat above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and CNN Rafael Romo joins us now from Las Vegas, Nevada, where an excessive heat warning is in effect, great to have you with us just explain how people they're managing it and what the authorities are saying.</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, it's been very hard for people around here the heat wave are definitely not over yet. And excessive heat warning remains in effect. For parts of the state you just mentioned Arizona, California and Nevada and the National Weather Service says dangerously hot afternoons was little overnight relief are expected adding that.</p><p>This will result in a major to extreme risk of heat related illness for much of the population. Here in Las Vegas, high temperatures were well over 40 degrees Celsius during the weekend and are expected to remain there during the week. Earlier I spoke with the ranger at Death Valley National Park in California, also known as the hottest place on earth.</p><p>And he told us what worries them is that this extreme weather seems to be a trend instead of a single occurrence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT LAMAR, DEATH VALLEY PARK RANGER: What we're seeing here in Death Valley is certainly that things are getting hotter. 7 of our 10 hottest summers have come in the last 10 years. And that's you know, obviously a global trends.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMO: Here in Las Vegas organizations are trying to make sure nobody goes without water making an effort to take care of people without a home. This is how a woman who's part of this effort explained their decision to help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Its life and death. I mean, there's no joking about that. That is literally this water will save a life. They're literally baking on the streets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMO: Julia, over the weekend here in Las Vegas, people were wondering if the old time record of 117 degrees Fahrenheit, 47 degrees Celsius was going to be broken. The temperature fell short yesterday but only by a couple of degrees. The National Weather Service says this heat wave is not typical there is heat due to its long duration extreme day tight temperatures and warm nights.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>They also say that everyone needs to take this heat seriously including those who live in places like this one in the desert, back to you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, I'm just looking at the ashphalt temperature. No bare feet allowed. Don't forget your flip flops, exhausting heat. Great to have you with us, thank you, Rafael Romo there. Alright, Southern Europe is also sweltering amid a severe heat wave right in the middle of the summer tourist season in Italy.</p><p>At least one person died and several tourists collapse from the extreme heat. Rome is one of 16 Italian cities under a warning of extreme risk to health due to the severely high temperatures. And La Palma in Spain's Canary Islands and out of control forest fire has forced at least 4000 people to leave their homes. Wow! OK, we'll be back right after this, stay with CNN.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", the recovery in the world's second largest economy losing pace. GDP expanded to 6.3 percent in the second quarter that's on a year on year basis that was well below expectations. And the disappointments continue indicators like record high youth unemployment to slowing retail sales and faltering business confidence and are raising expectations or further government support.</p><p>To give us some context too, joining us now, Derek Scissors, Chief Economist at China Beige Book, he's also a Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Derek good to have you with us. Can you please just start by putting some of these percentages into perspective or as we know 2022 was incredibly weak because China was still in lockdown?</p><p>So it flatters the numbers that we're getting this year. But yet everybody's concerned that we're seeing slowing context please.</p><p>DEREK SCISSORS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CHINA BEIGE BOOK: Right 6.3 percent year on year GDP growth sounds great.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>SCISSORS: But last year, during the second quarter, SHANGHAI was hit with a COVID outbreak. China was essentially in a recession. People thought this was going to be the quarter that really made all of 2023. They thought we could get 7.5 percent growth on year and we were well below that, which puts all 2023 in jeopardy because of the rest of the year is going to be more normal.</p><p>And we're going to see numbers in the fours and then the kicker there is we actually saw outright deflation in the second quarter real growth was faster than nominal growth meaning the inflation adjustment was negative.</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>And outright deflation is a very scary thing because it tends to become embedded and that means slow growth going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: This caught my attention too. In a world of still excessively high becoming cooling prices, China's price weakness stands out. And it's not just about consumer prices. It's also in the producer prices, which for me, suggests that they're anticipating demand weakness, which is not just about China.</p><p>But it has implications for the rest of the world too. Just expand on what we're seeing there on that concern?</p><p>SCISSORS: Right, consumer prices are basically flat right now, or at least on the latest reading, which is not good. You want mild consumer inflation, less than we've had around the world recently, but more than we see in China, but then producer prices are outright negative and they have been for a while.</p><p>So the normal story and China there's too much supply. China tends to over build in key industries and have too many firms and then they send their supply overseas. That's a concern. As you said, we now have inadequate demand, certainly in China. And it appears to be true around the world, possibly with the exception of the U.S.</p><p>So we have a one-two punch too much supply and China weak demand globally and in China, and you get this negative producer price trend.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it makes the consumption data and the retail sales data all that more important to watch. The other thing that leaps out is the youth unemployment rate. In fact, jobs in general, quite frankly, vitally important for maintaining confidence in government, local government and the centralized government in China's jobs growth.</p><p>And what was it 12 million jobs, I believe they said last year that they managed to provide what's the expectation this year? And what do you make of the admission of a record high youth unemployment rate?</p><p>SCISSORS: Yes, so that people are focusing on youth unemployment with good reason when anyone says any sort of unemployment is 21 percent, it gets your attention. A supplement to that is last year when China really underperformed because of zero COVID and everyone thought it was a terrible year.</p><p>They claim they created 12 million new jobs, as you said, and this year, they're not claiming anything, which is very odd. You'd think this year where things are better. They they're not much better, but they are better, that we get more claims of job creation. So we have a one-two punch, there's clearly a problem in the new segment of the labor market.</p><p>But also the dynamism of the economy, China's gone silent on it, after being perfectly willing to talk about it last year in a bad year, it almost makes it seem that this year is worse for the labor market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you believe the data? Derek, do you believe if that saying gone?</p><p>SCISSORS: No, I mean, I generally don't. I mean, the unemployment figures, the way China counts unemployment, it actually exaggerates youth unemployment and understates everyone else's unemployment, because you have to be in the labor market for a while, in order to count.</p><p>They have a number of problems with other data over time. I don't necessarily believe their price measurements. So I will say the government's willingness to be realistic. You know, they're not putting out a false jobs number. They're just not telling us that we're willing to report slower growth, I find that somewhat reassuring.</p><p>But it's also the case that when you know, it'll be typically that when the provinces report their own growth, very few of them will be below the national average. That's a problem China's had for a long time, and they've never even tried to fix it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, how do you even fix that I just, if I'm thinking about, let's assume we believe the data and it is fairly accurate, a -- of young people out of jobs that's in this economy. A lot of parents that are supporting an extra person writing checks, that's going to have an impact on competence.</p><p>That's going to have an impact on the consumption concerns that we're talking about, but for the rest of the year, if not beyond. To your point about hoping for some kind of silver lining in the rest of the year, I sort of struggled to see where it comes from and how they generate that in the short term, if not through stimulus?</p><p>SCISSORS: Well, so before we get into stimulus, you're exactly right. I mean, China's households have disappointed everyone by saving so much. But if you have a child or a young adult who has, you know, a one in five chance of being unemployed and they're talking about higher unemployment in July, you have reason to save.</p><p>So then everybody, as you said, switches to talking about stimulus. But in fact, China's already tried monetary stimulus, loan growth, the stock of loans are growing more than twice as fast as GDP. So, you know, you're trying that it's not working. And on the fiscal side, China's fiscal spending has always been directed at firms and production, especially new buildings, for example, on the construction side.</p><p>Those are not the jobs anyone wants and China's already overspent in that area. So you can talk about stimulus but it's not obvious how to make stimulus work.</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's your forecast for this year? I've noticed a number of analysts already this morning cutting their growth forecasts for China this year. Where do you lie now? And what is the best way in your mind? How can they improve this situation?</p><p>SCISSORS: Well, I should say that I expected a better year this year than we've seen. So I have to do what everyone else is doing and revise my forecasts down. I think they'll make 5 percent because the party when it's close tends to make its targets, as in if it's 4.5 percent they're going to report 5 percent.</p><p>A lot of us including me were expecting something more like seven. In terms of how to make the economy better, we may have seen a step in the last few weeks of ending the crackdown on private tech firms, such as Alibaba and Tencent, not just them, but certainly including them.</p><p>That would be a step in the right direction, it's only one other steps would have to be taken to allow the market a little more play to encourage consumption. But that would be more useful. That is more useful than saying, oh, you know, we're going to have 12 percent growth, loan growth instead of 11 percent. So that would be the way for the year to be stronger than expected.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, help address the lack of competence from international investors. And that's something clearly that monetary policy at this stage can't help address. Yes, Gerek, good to get your perspective, thank you.</p><p>SCISSORS: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Derek Scissors, the Chief Economist at China Beige Book, thank you. OK, after the break a cash conundrum at Twitter, we'll discuss what Elon Musk revealed about the company's finances, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", and I can't believe I didn't know this but there you can see it. It's World Emoji Day apparently being celebrated at the New York Stock Exchange. Imagine being one of those employees that were told they could be on the balcony but had to dress as an emoji.</p><p>Yes. Here's a look at the opening bell and market open this morning. We were expecting quite trade ahead of a series of corporate earnings this week, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Netflix, and Tesla of course, too. It's a mixed bag but the NASDAQ does seem to be looking to add to last week's gains too.</p><p>Here's a look at Activision Blizzard though and Tesla's shares of Elon Musk's company higher as it rolls out its first cybertruck. And Activision Blizzard also up as well after Microsoft reached an agreement to keep the Call of Duty series on Sony PlayStation that stock up some 3.5 percent in early trade.</p><p>Now speaking of Elon Musk and Tesla and emojis of course, too, there's a link Elon Musk revealing that Twitter has lost around half of its advertising revenue and still has a negative cash flow. Because in response to business advice from a follower, the billionaire tweeted, \"need to reach positive cash flow before we have the luxury of anything else\".</p><p>It's a stark contrast to his tone just a few months ago when he told the BBC that Twitter is roughly breaking even and that most of its advertisers have returned. Clare Duffy joins us now. That's an interesting one. I guess all those things could be true, because the cash burn could have reduced and all advertisers may have returned.</p><p>They're just giving him half the money. But one has to question. Yes, right. I agree with you, raise hands moment, there's an emoji for that.</p><p>CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Yes. Julia. I mean, it's hard to know what to believe in terms of what Elon Musk is saying about this company, who has much earlier this year him warning that the company could face bankruptcy than in April. He's telling the BBC that the company is nearly breakeven and that most advertisers have returned.</p><p>And now we're getting this tweet where he says that the company is down about 50 percent in advertising revenue and the cash flow is still negative. This 50 percent figure does track a bit more with what we understood about the state of the company. We reported in June that about 60 percent of Twitter's top 1000 advertisers before Musk's takeover had stopped their spending on the platform as of April.</p><p>The New York Times also reported last month that Twitter's ad revenue was down about 60 percent. So this seems a bit more in line with what we understood about the state of the company. And I do think this tweet as a reminder of just how important advertising revenue is to, Twitter.</p><p>Elon Musk has been trying to grow these other revenue streams, charging for verification charging users to use TweetDeck. And yet unless they can get advertisers to return to the platform, this company is still going to be struggling. And I also think Julia it's interesting.</p><p>That's about a month and a half since Twitter's new CEO, Linda Yaccarino started in the role. She's a Former Advertising Exec, who was hired with the hope that she could help convince advertisers to return to this platform. And I think this is a reminder that she still has a long way to go in that respect.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I've met her and she's pretty punchy. So I wonder as well, where there's some of the sort of get real and be honest about the facts. And the situation here is part of some of the shift. We're seeing this, of course, and the difference between breakeven.</p><p>And now, some greater understanding of what's going on with the financials has happened since Threads was launched, of course, by Meta, formerly Facebook, and you and I have talked about that in the past too. Now one could argue there's even more competition for that advertising money.</p><p>DUFFY: Absolutely. I mean, Meta hasn't started allowing advertising on Threads just yet. But I can imagine a lot of advertisers are probably in a sort of wait and see mode to see if more users leave Twitter. Or Twitter, you know, new people don't join Twitter, they joined Threads instead.</p><p>And so, you know, advertisers for a lot of this year had been in sort of a wait and see mode to see what Elon Musk does with this platform. And I think this is only going to continue that sort of period of waiting to see whether they want to be on Twitter or not.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quick question. Did we ever get to the bottom you and I was discussing this terminology of Threads?</p><p>DUFFY: Yes. So Instagram CEO, Adam Mosseri, who was running Threads, said that a post on thread is called a post. And if you have multiple posts in a row, it's a thread but it's not like a tweet where a post is called a thread. So it's still a little confusing to me, but when you post on Threads, it is supposedly called a post not a thread.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: -- posting on everything if you posting so that's ambitious, I think to suggest that they're going to harness the name posting it only referred to them. Clare Duffy --</p><p>DUFFY: I think yes, little sign that things are tricky there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We think that name too late now. Thank you. OK. Meanwhile, former employees of Twitter's only office in Africa say they never received severance pay. The layoffs were part of Elon Musk's global cost cutting plan just four days after Twitter opened an office in Ghana's capital of Accra.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>As part of the cuts staff has accepted Twitter's offer to pay them three month's severance but seven months later they say they haven't seen a cent. And CNN has reached out to Twitter for comment. Larry Madowo joins us now. This is great reporting, important to understand how this is all being handled. What were these people saying to you and what do they think's going on several months later?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Julia, CNN has spoken exclusively to several former employees of Twitter's only African office and Ghana's well as their attorney. And they say the last day at Twitter officially was December 4, we're in July now. And they still have not seen a cent.</p><p>Initially Twitter is not even going to negotiate with them until CNN reported on their case. And then Twitter came back and says its fine. We can negotiate. They believe that to the lowball them and only agreed, offered them three months of severance, no benefits, no stocks vesting, nothing else compared to what people in Europe and North America received.</p><p>But they were tired of this drawn out process. They didn't want to take on the extra burden of a court case. So they agreed to it that was back in May. So far silence from Twitter. In fact, one of them told me that literally ghosted us and they don't understand why this is happening to them.</p><p>They're a small team of just 11 people there not hundreds of people that work for Twitter in Africa. I want to read a quote for you from their attorney who has been representing them from the beginning. Carla Olympio, she says, unfortunately, it appears that after having unethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises, and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year.</p><p>Now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks. And she says they're considering legal action against Twitter and various jurisdictions, including in Ghana, and we reached out to Twitter, Julia, for a comment regarding the status of these 11 former employees of Twitter.</p><p>It seems unlikely that the world's richest man can pay severance to just 11 people. We got back what is now an automated response for all press inquiries, a poop emoji.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and that's been the case since March, any effort to get in contact via the press department at Twitter gets you a poop emoji, which in this case. And Larry, just to be clear, some of these people has moved to Ghana, from other African nations to take up these jobs. There were no protections in their contract, or an event like this.</p><p>MADOWO: That' right. They did move to the country from Nigeria and other neighboring countries because of their special expertise. And Twitter is very proud and the Jack Dorsey to have set up this office in Africa. Jack Dorsey talked about potentially moving to Africa for six months.</p><p>And so their legal status depended on their employment of Twitter. So they've been left in a lurch for so long. Part of the agreement with the severance pay for Twitter was for them to get paid repatriation costs, and nothing has happened. And here's the other complication, Julia that you rightly point out that if Twitter no longer has a presence in Ghana, realistically.</p><p>Ghanaian authorities cannot compel it to comply if they don't have a legal entity in the country.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's such a great point. Well, we're once again raising a torch or a flashlight for these people to try and get them some kind of better response than a poop emoji. Yes, Larry, great to have you, thank you. Coming up after the break, Google's been searching for solutions to build a digital skills gap.</p><p>We'll hear about his strive to give job seekers the tools they need to find better jobs, and it's working, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", authorities in South Korea say 40 people have now died from flash floods and landslides in the past few days. 13 people died in a flooded underpass in the central part of the country when extreme weather turned an ordinary road journey into a tragedy, as Michael Holmes reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice over): Working in mud and against the clock, rescue is in South Korea pump water from a flooded tunnel. Acts of water redirected from the ones clogged underpass, revealing some of the vehicles trapped inside. Dash cam video shows how quickly the tunnel filled up on Saturday.</p><p>Local authorities say a levee broke after days of heavy rain across the country sending a rush of water through the underpass, some cars barely escaping the deluge. But authorities say 15 vehicles including a bus were trapped in the tunnel along with their drivers and passengers.</p><p>Divers have been painstakingly searching for them and have retrieved multiple bodies from the scene. Many family members of those thought to be missing gathered at a nearby hospital. Their misery compounded by the agony of a long wait for information. One man says he's speechless and says he hasn't eaten for hours while waiting for authorities to brief him.</p><p>The tragedy has shocked South Korea some people saying the government should have been better prepared after last year's torrential rains, which were the worst in 115 years. One man who lives near the tunnel says authorities should have closed it when flooding was expected.</p><p>He says he feels like this could have easily happened to him and he feels like part of himself died too. Heavy monsoon rains, of course, dozens of deaths not just in the tunnel but across the country. Thousands of people forced to evacuate because of floods and landslides.</p><p>In some areas riverbanks completely collapsed because of saturated ground. And meteorologists warn it could get worse, with as much as 300 millimeters of additional rain forecast to fall in some parts of the country over the next few days. Other parts of Asia are also dealing with intense weather, Southern China bracing for a powerful storm which is expected to lash the area with strong winds and heavy rains in the next few days.</p><p>And parts of New Delhi are still waterlogged, even though water levels in the Yamuna River which flooded the city have receded. But the water hasn't drained away yet creating very wet and frustrating circumstances for people just trying to move about the city. Michael Holmes, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And to Russia now, classrooms are slowly becoming bleak monuments to the country's war dead. It's part of a patriotic program by the Kremlin and a means to stamp out early seeds of dissent against the war in Ukraine and the Putin regime. Clare Sebastian has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The marching is not perfectly in time. But what the ceremony lacks in military precision, it makes up for the propaganda value. These children in Central Russia will now get the chance to sit at a new desk. Blazoned with the face of one of Russia's war dead, a former pupil at this school killed just three days into the invasion.</p><p>His grieving mother struggling through, these so called Hero Desks turning classrooms into bleak memorials of a death toll Russia has otherwise tried to hide are actually part of a government initiative. Russia's ruling party says they now number over 14,000. They were apparently including veterans of other wars.</p><p>DANIIL KEN, HEAD OF ALLIANCE OF TEACHERS UNION: You see as a -- , his name he was our pupil just several years ago.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>It tried to save our country and for very young people. It's hard not to feel painful.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Daniil Ken have an openly anti-Kremlin Teachers Union now living outside Russia says the atmosphere in schools changed overnight when the war started. Information so tightly controlled, he says multiple teachers have been fired, some even fined for speaking up.</p><p>A fate that Olga, a teacher in St. Petersburg we've changed her name and disguised her identity for safety reasons, narrowly avoided.</p><p>OLGA, TEACHER: I also tried to convince my colleagues that our country has committed a crime. One week later the Director of the School invited me to talk and she warned me that if I continue then she will have to appeal to special body on the stage. She meant FSB.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): And then there are the not so subtle curriculum changes this video on the Crimean bridge part of a new state controlled weekly lesson series launched last year called conversations about important things. It's not just a transport crossing, the speaker explains but a spiritual crossing.</p><p>No mention of the huge explosion that caused part of the bridge to collapse a few months earlier. History is being rewritten in the textbooks this one now includes the so called special military operation. And it's not just recent history.</p><p>OLGA: It is an historic fact that Russian state began with the Kyiv. Kyivskaya, Russia, so to say, but nowadays the new textbooks of history are issued where this idea is removed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): Scenes like this at a school in Crimea will also likely become much more common. Basic military preparation a throwback to Soviet times set to officially re-enter the school curriculum for older classes.</p><p>KEN: It's a cheap, simple method of reaching a very large audience and to get across the government's position. It is in essence moral violence against children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Education for comment on the purpose of these changes and gotten her response. Sitting at these hero desks in many schools are award for only the best students. A morbid incentive designed to breed a generation patriotic enough to accept a war whose consequences they are sure to inherit. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, coming up here on \"First Move\", Messi in Miami. The iconic Lionel Messi superstar introduction to his adoring fans in South Florida, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", researchers expressing concern due to a sudden heat wave off the coast of Florida. It has water temperatures soaring to record levels that could put one of the state's most precious resources coral reefs at risk. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam explains how the extreme heat has triggered coral bleaching.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR (voice over): A heat wave off the coast of Florida is sending water temperatures to unprecedented highs. While that's not a problem for some swimmers, it is a major concern for coral reefs. Corals thrive with ocean temperatures in the mid-80s but lately they have been soaring into the 90s.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where in the world are they measuring these off the chart record ocean temperatures?</p><p>DAM (voice over): Including this NOAA sensor, one research scientist showed me near Miami. It's broken its daily record the past four days in a row. South Florida's abnormally warm water could put area corals on the verge of extinction. Dr. Andrew Baker is a Professor of Marine Biology and Ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School.</p><p>ANDREW BAKER, PROFESSOR OF MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI: The Marine heat wave is more or less throughout the Caribbean at this point. Certain parts of the Caribbean like Belize are already bleaching and bleaching pretty severely, and Florida is where Belize was about a month ago.</p><p>DAM (on camera): This is a healthy brown piece of coral. If it was to bleach, it would turn all white and could potentially die. That is what scientists are concerned about. If this marine heat wave continues to build.</p><p>DAM (voice over): Losing coral could be costly. Coral reefs generate billions of dollars for Florida's economy through activities like fishing and tourism, which wouldn't be possible without reefs to protect the species that rely on them.</p><p>BAKER: We've been working for several years on ways to make corals more thermally tolerant.</p><p>DAM (voice over): Engineering coral that can withstand even a five degree temperature increase in our oceans will mitigate the effects of stronger marine heat waves that are expected in the future. Corals are one of the most sensitive ecosystems to the effects of climate change. Without them, we could lose a natural defense system as healthy corals help protect our coastlines during hurricanes.</p><p>BAKER: And so reef restoration efforts that are ongoing right now are really taking steps to plan for climate change to try to make sure that we restore reefs to be suitable for a future environment. I'm not the victims on it.</p><p>DAM (voice over): Ken Nedimyer is the Technical Director at Reef Renewal U.S.A. He works to restore coral reefs in the Florida Keys and is hopeful about the future.</p><p>KEN NEDIMYER, FOUNDER OF REEF RENEWAL USA: There are corals that can live in hotter water, we just have to find them and try to repopulate with them.</p><p>DAM (voice over): After one year Dr. Baker's research is hitting its initial milestones already seen results with coral surviving in slightly warmer temperatures.</p><p>BAKER: We've had a few pilot experiments out there on the reefs that we've manipulated to try to make corals more thermally tolerant and this will be an actual test of that.</p><p>DAM (voice over): Not ready to throw the towel in just yet. Optimism amid record breaking weather patterns with no immediate signs of cooling off. Derek Van Dam, CNN, Miami.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now one of the greatest footballers of all time arriving in Florida. Lionel Messi celebrated at an Inter Milan introductory events Sunday night which included the team's co-owner David Beckham. Now some tickets for Messi's first match on Friday are changing hands for as much as $110,000.</p><p>Carlos Suarez joins us now. Is that true? That's insane, but he certainly owning his price tag.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, apparently some tickets on some real reselling websites are going for that kind of number. It was an incredible night out here as thousands of Inter Miami CF fans gathered to welcome Lionel Messi to South Florida. Now Messi doesn't make his official debut with the team until Friday, though he has a team practice that is scheduled for tomorrow.</p><p>As I noted, coming out to me here at least, right now some tickets are going for at least about $500 for Friday's match, but as you noted, some reselling websites have put some tickets at $110,000 just to watch one of the greatest soccer players make his big debut in the U.S. Of course, Julia, there's a great deal of expectation and hope that Lionel Messi is going to grow U.S. Soccer.</p><p>There really hasn't been this big of a name when it comes to American soccer since belay played in New York City back in 1975. But all of this, of course, is adding to a great deal of hope and frenzy around Lionel Messi as we head into the coming years especially comes the 2026 World Cup. Of course, the U.S. is one of the host countries for -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, of course, and just quickly, you can charge what you like the question is, are people paying for it? Which is the other thing? Are you going to be there on Friday, very quickly?</p><p>SUAREZ: Exactly, yes my hope is to be here on Friday. Go I'm not paying anywhere near even $10 per ticket.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, just checking Carlos, I'm being charged up got to go, thank you, Carlos.

By night, or anytime a wildfire breaks out or spreads to State forests, some of the approximately 140 DOFAW employees statewide subject to fire call-out grab their gear and firefighting apparatus and head out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of the time Ryan Peralta is a DOFAW Forest Management Supervisor but he has decades of experience battling wildfires. Many times, he is the incident commander on the scene, directing crews and equipment to hot spots and flare-ups.</p><p>\"The people who work for DOFAW want to be in the forest and working with wildlife. Instead of planting trees we may be putting out a fire. Instead of releasing game birds, we may be fighting fires. We like it, but it is sad to see the damage fires do to the forest and watershed,\" Peralta said.</p><p>Over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, as many as twenty DOFAW firefighters were helping bring a fire under control in Kalihi, which had spread into the Honolulu Forest Reserve.</p><p>The tools of their trade include shovels, portable and truck-mounted water tanks, Pulaski's, helicopters and a ton of common sense and training in how to safely fight the flames.</p><p>Peralta cites the Chapter 185 land-fire law, which makes the DOFAW firefighters the first and primary responders for fires in all forest reserves, natural area reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and any lands under the jurisdiction of the division.</p><p>Mike Walker is the State Protection Forester who is responsible for the management and administration of the DOFAW fire team. He expanded on the training staffers need. \"At a minimum they need to be trained in basic wildland firefighting by passing two courses from the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, which sets the standards nationwide for wildfire training. Many of our staff are also trained in helicopter operations, as well having other specialized and leadership training,\" Walker explained.</p><p>Firefighting no matter what kind structure or wildland, is physically demanding, dirty, smokey, and at times, dangerous work. This is why safety is always the key consideration and firefighter training focuses greatly on how to work safely.</p><p>One of the major differences between municipal fire departments and the wildland fire team, as Peralta points out, is structure fires are typically much shorter in duration. A forest fire can burn for days or even weeks. \"It is tough work. Long hours and a lot of physical, hard labor and a lot of looking at the same person constantly until the fire is out. We go everyday until the fire is out. The principles are the same, put the wet stuff on the red stuff, just be careful and do what you got to do,\" Peralta commented.</p><p>The Kalihi area blaze, called the Kahauiki Last Char fire burned an estimated 50 acres. Not large by mainland standards, but as a percentage of total land mass, Hawai'i loses as much acreage to wildfires each year as most western states. Climate change experts predict in the coming decades the world will see higher frequencies of wildfires and more ferocious ones.</p><p>In Hawai'i, like most other places, there is no longer a fire season. Now, fires can and do start every month of the year here and elsewhere. Most of the fires the DOFAW team fights are as the result of unattended campfires out in the forest. This latest fire is more unusual in that it burned in what's called the wildland-urban interface, called WUI in the firefighting community.</p><p>\"It started above apartments, topped the ridge, and was beginning to slop over an access road on the other side and could have reached hundreds of homes at Ft. Shafter. For fires in the WUI we do play a role in protecting structures and of course lives,\" said Jason Misaki, the Kahauiki Last Char fire incident commander.</p><p>His \"regular job\" is the DOFAW O'ahu Branch Wildlife Program Manager. \"It's football season. I watch a lot of football, but if we get a call on a Sunday, it's let's go...let's get out there and get to work. Everybody comes together and everybody is enthusiastic and passionate about doing the job. It's game day every time,\" Misaki said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124871033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6469-BKD1-JCBF-S0XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most national political forecasters rate the district as 'lean Democrat,' though there has not been any public polling recently released. <br/>DeFazio's retirement represents an opportunity for Republicans to flip a long-held Democratic seat in what experts believe is an electoral environment this year that favors right-leaning candidates. <br/>Oregon hasn't elected more than one Republican to the state's congressional delegation since 1994, and a Republican hasn't represented this district since 1975. <br/>As it is, Republicans are favored to reclaim the House, but in a contest that could be decided by just a handful of seats, Democrats losing Oregon's Congressional District 4 would be a troubling loss. <br/>The district's largest city is still Eugene, but now it includes more of the coastal region \u2014 from the California border to north of Lincoln City \u2014 while the areas east of Corvallis and southeast of Roseburg were cut out. <br/>'He could win, but it's a real uphill battle. (Skarlatos) is so identified with the Trump brand, and that will do him well in big parts of the district, but it will not do as well in the population centers,' said Jim Moore, political science professor at Pacific University. '(Hoyle) is a pretty strong candidate. She's run everywhere in the district before She's running on her record: 'I'm not a neophyte, I know what legislation is and I know how Congress works.'' <br/>Working in Skarlatos' favor is his fundraising advantage: For this election cycle through June 30, he received more than $2.4 million in campaign contributions, compared to shy of $1.2 million for Hoyle, according to the latest federal campaign finance data. <br/> He could win, but it's a real uphill battle. <br/> - Jim Moore, political science professor at Pacific University<br/><br/> The vast majority of Skarlatos' contributions have come from individuals, though according to itemized receipts, fewer than half live in Oregon. His largest single contribution was $63,000 from the Take Back the House 2022 political action committee, led by U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California. <br/>Hoyle has far fewer individual donors than Skarlatos, but does have the support of labor unions and some national Democratic political action committees. <br/>She also has received support from independent political action committees. During the primary, political action committee Web3 Forward spent more than $500,000 on advertisements in support of Hoyle. The group purports to support Democratic candidates who are 'committed to making the next generation internet more secure, open and owned by the users.' <br/>Hoyle's support from outside groups continued past the primary: In September, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent an estimated $800,000 on digital media advertisements against Skarlatos. <br/>Skarlatos has not been the beneficiary of any outside spending from political action committees either on his behalf or against Hoyle, according to campaign finance data. <br/>The next quarterly financial filing deadline is Oct. 15, which will show if Hoyle has been able to close the gap. <br/> Alek Skarlatos, Republican <br/><br/>Skarlatos and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for an interview for this article. <br/>The son of a Greek immigrant father, Skarlatos grew up in Northern California before moving to Oregon as a teen and graduating from Roseburg High School.  <br/>He rose to prominence after he and five other people stopped an attempted terrorist attack on a Paris-bound train in 2015. Skarlatos was awarded several commendations, including the U.S. Army's Soldier's Medal from former President Barack Obama. He later starred as himself in a Clint Eastwood film about the attack. <br/>Skarlatos first sought public office in 2018 with an ultimately unsuccessful campaign for Douglas County commissioner. He then ran for Congressional District 4 in 2020, losing to DeFazio in the general election by 5.3 percentage points, the narrowest victory of DeFazio's congressional career. <br/>The 2020 campaign led some national GOP figures to dub Skarlatos a rising star in the party. <br/>Skarlatos has been a controversial figure since his appearance in politics. He has made statements doubting the impact of climate change on forest fire severity, downplayed the Jan. 6 insurrection on multiple occasions and showed support for businesses flouting masking rules during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. <br/>As the Capital Chronicle first reported last month[1], Skarlatos joked about strangling women on a podcast shortly before beginning his political career four years ago and has repeatedly 'liked' photos of underage girls on Instagram in the years since. <br/> It just seems like this country is really at a turning point. And if we can't win in an open seat in this kind of a year in Oregon, it just seems like we're hopeless. <br/> - Alek Skarlatos, Republican candidate in the Congressional District 4 race <br/><br/> In 2020, Skarlatos accepted an endorsement from QAnon conspiracy theorist and Oregon U.S. Senate candidate Jo Rae Perkins and offered her his well wishes in a since-deleted tweet. <br/>This election, Skarlatos has appeared to attempt to moderate his image, focusing on issues like rising costs for gas and health care and bringing 'balance' to Washington, D.C. with Democrats currently in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. In campaign ads, he has touted Obama's praise of his 2015 heroics and tried to persuade 2020 Biden voters to support him. <br/>In a candidate forum on Oct. 6, Skarlatos said that he supports the Affordable Care Act, would not vote for a national abortion ban (but was in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and liked a tweet comparing abortion to slavery in June), is against expanding the U.S. role in the Russia-Ukraine war and would work with both parties if elected.  <br/>'It just seems like this country is really at a turning point. And if we can't win in an open seat in this kind of a year in Oregon, it just seems like we're hopeless,' he told Fox News during a recent interview. <br/>Skarlatos has targeted Hoyle for her support of legislation that he says led to higher taxes and costs for small businesses, hospitals and average Oregonians. He has also criticized her for supporting a bill that he says protected pharmaceutical companies at the expense of people. <br/> Val Hoyle, Democrat <br/><br/>Hoyle and her family moved to Lane County in 1999 and she began her career in elected office a decade later when she was appointed to replace the outgoing Democratic representative for the Eugene area. <br/>She was elected to a full term in 2010 and held her seat until 2017, rising to the position of House Democratic caucus leader. <br/>During her time in office, she helped pass a variety of Democratic priorities, including: a minimum wage increase, coal to clean energy by 2030, background checks for gun sales between private parties and the Clean Fuels Program. <br/>She declined to run for reelection in 2016, instead seeking the office of secretary of state, but losing in the Democratic primary. Two years later she was elected as commissioner of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, which is a nonpartisan position responsible for overseeing the agency that protects workers' employment rights and opportunities.  <br/>Hoyle has positioned herself in this campaign as a logical successor to DeFazio, calling him both a friend and a political mentor. She said DeFazio was always a strong advocate for this district, and she would bring the same mentality to the job. The district doesn't need a dyed-in-the-wool progressive or conservative, but someone who will listen to what the people need, Hoyle said.  <br/>'They need someone who actually understands (the district) and who isn't just going to feed them a line,' she said.  <br/>Hoyle said Skarlatos is being disingenuous as he tries to portray himself in this campaign as a more moderate Republican. She saw a far-right Republican candidate in 2020, and that's still who he is, she said. <br/> I'm not going to sit on the sidelines at this point in time when I know our district needs a fighter. <br/> - Val Hoyle. Democratic candidate in Congressional District 4 race <br/><br/> 'His reason for holding these positions is so he can get elected,' she said. <br/>Hoyle said her priorities in Congress would be to improve infrastructure, maintain the social safety net and rebuild the middle class. On her website she says she would vote in support of protecting abortion access, universal health care, a $15 per hour federal minimum wage, comprehensive paid family and medical leave for all workers and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. <br/>Hoyle said her experience with labor and business and working in the private sector for years gives her a unique perspective on what policies are likely to benefit all sides of the economy. <br/>But what finally pushed her to run for Congress was her belief that the U.S. democracy would be at-risk if Republicans \u2014 who critics say increasingly hold anti-democratic views, particularly in their denial of the 2020 presidential election results \u2014 gained control of the House of Representatives. <br/>She recalled a conversation she had with her cousin about her apprehension to go to D.C. when there was still much to do in Oregon. Her cousin reminded her of her concerns, and that now could be a time to act on them. <br/>'I'm not going to sit on the sidelines at this point in time when I know our district needs a fighter,' Hoyle said. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/09/12/oregon-republican-candidate-alek-skarlatos-joked-about-choking-women/\">https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/09/12/oregon-republican-candidate-alek-skarlatos-joked-about-choking-women/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/10/26/former-guardsman-faces-current-labor-commissioner-in-4th-congressional-district/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009988166679553348825876100056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66PS-FCW1-F03R-N50K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1731\"/><timeReceived>2:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Oregon Capital Chronicle</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 26, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGJ</classCode><className>ELECTORAL DISTRICTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN5Y</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKET UPDATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TTT</classCode><className>POLITICAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000245</classCode><className>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DBE6</classCode><className>POLITICAL DONATIONS &amp;

The mountainous city of Flagstaff was shrouded in smoke yesterday, and ash was falling from the sky. The national forest surrounding it announced a full closure set to begin later this week -- the first time that has happened since 2006. Intense heat that has hampered firefighting efforts more broadly was expected to moderate in the coming days. </p><p>But the National Weather Service noted it could bring uncertainty for fire crews. \"The humidity and the possibility of some scattered rainfall is a good thing,\" said meteorologist Andrew Taylor. \"The lightning is not a good thing.\" In California, firefighters still faced the difficult task of trying to contain a large forest fire in rugged coastal mountains south of Big Sur that forced the evacuation of a Buddhist monastery and nearby campground. In New Mexico, lightning-sparked blazes have been scorching the southern part of the state where a large portion of the Gila Wilderness remains closed, and fire officials are closely watching the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument. More land has burned across Arizona so far to date with new wildfire starts quickly shifting resources. While humans are to blame for an overwhelming majority of wildfires, lightning started a 31-square-mile blaze west of Sedona that was moving toward Flagstaff. A top-tier management team had been ordered to oversee the blaze that's burning in grass, juniper, chaparral and ponderosa pine. Some campers already evacuated, and residents of rural areas have been told to prepare to evacuate on a moment's notice, said Coconino County sheriff's spokesman Jon Paxton. If the fire continues its northeastern push, hundreds of people in Flagstaff -- a college city about two hours north of Phoenix -- also could be affected, Paxton said. Fire officials were mapping out a plan to starve the Rafael Fire of fuel as it moves through rugged terrain, canyons and wilderness, said Bureau of Land Management fire information officer Dolores Garcia. As of yesterday, it was moving parallel to Interstate 40 along the Coconino and Yavapai county lines. The fire was about 16 miles from Flagstaff, but it's hard to say how quickly it was spreading through various terrain, Garcia said. Two national forests in northern Arizona made rare announcements to close completely to visitors starting tomorrow because of concerns they won't have enough resources to respond to any future wildfires.</p><p>\"We have limited resources, and we're tapped right now,\" said Brady Smith, a spokesman for the Coconino National Forest that surrounds Flagstaff. The Coconino last issued a full closure in 2006. The nearby Kaibab National Forest, which borders the Grand Canyon, last fully closed in 2002. Both forests are popular for hiking, camping, fishing and other recreation because they sit at higher elevations and are much cooler than the state's desert areas. Firefighters in Oregon were focused on two wildfires, one burning near the state's highest peak and another in the southern part of the state that was threatening 125 structures. In Utah, several wildfires were burning in bone-dry conditions. The largest near the small town of Enterprise in southern Utah forced evacuations over the weekend. But homeowners were allowed to return as containment reached 50%. -- Felicia Fonseca, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6362-5941-DY7N-F183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 22, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Groggs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the group's long period of silence after Grogg's death, their small but passionate fanbase both mourned the loss and wondered if remaining members Ritchie with a T and Parker Corey would ever produce music again. One year later, the trio-turned-duo returned with \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\", their most ambitious project yet, and a beautiful tribute to Groggs's life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Injury Reserve garnered acclaim from fans and critics alike with their previous projects \"Floss\", \"Drive It Like Its Stolen\", and their self-titled album. All of these were filled with unkempt lyrical delivery served over distinct, chaotic production.</p><p>In the crowded sub-genre of experimental hip-hop, the trio was consistently eager to push the limits of their own music and the genre as a whole. Injury Reserve was a breath of fresh air, and despite their aggressive sound, they never seemed to take themselves too seriously. Their breakout song, \"Jailbreak the Tesla\", was almost entirely produced using recorded sounds from a car.</p><p>Understandably so, this humor is lost on their new album and is replaced by a much darker creative direction. The production is clearly shaped by grief and anguish - the remaining members' pain after the passing of Groggs is tangible and inescapable throughout the forty-minute runtime.</p><p>The intro track, \"Outside\", sets a strong sonic and thematic tone for the album with Ritchie's pitched-down, painstaking vocals set over a scattered, percussion-heavy beat. The lyrics are eerie and cryptic, with hard-hitting lines like, \"We cannot end this with an agree to disagree / There is no happy medium / That is nothing, that is nothing.\"</p><p>Another crucial moment in the album is found on track seven, \"Top Picks for You\". On this track, Ritchie speaks directly to the passing of Groggs with emotionally-packed lines like, \"I felt loss but a hole like this I never could've imagined / Your pattern's still in place, algorithm's still in action / As I scroll through I see a piece of you is still reacting.\" Ritchie appears to be reckoning with feeling the online and musical presence of Groggs while learning to cope with his physical loss. This track comes across more as spoken-word than hip-hop; the production is percussion-less and minimalistic.</p><p>Songs like these show how far Injury Reserve has progressed as a group. While Parker Corey's signature production style shines through on tracks like \"Superman That\" or \"Footwork in a Forest Fire\", Injury Reserve still shows far more versatility on their new EP. They experiment with more musical empty space than ever before, and on more vulnerable songs like \"Knees\", they blur the lines between experimental hip-hop and post-rock.</p><p>Because of the production risks that Parker Corey takes on this new album, the group is able to create a unique, atmospheric listening experience - a new world for the audience to lose themselves in. This world feels like a blend between apocalyptic sci-fi and old-school Western on ketamine. There's an impending sense of doom set up by tension-building production and lyrics like, \"Ain't no saving me / Ain't no saving me or you,\" or \"Manic in the skies / There's panic in the sky / Even when it's down below / There's nowhere to go.\" The emotional impact of this tear-jerking, anxiety-inducing album cannot be understated.</p><p>This album solidifies Injury Reserve as one of the most multi-faceted and creative musical acts in recent years, and, while \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" may mark the end of the infamous three-man weave of Injury Reserve, Groggs's musical presence will be felt for years to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5112438</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63VB-N241-DY7P-T40R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Old Gold and Black: Wake Forest University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 14, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Winston Salem</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6M</classCode><className>RAP MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS69</classCode><className>GRIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D1NX</classCode><className>WINSTON-SALEM, NC, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It must be updated every 10 years and this version is updating the original Connecticut Forest Action Plan (originally called the Forest Resource Assessment and Strategy) completed in 2010.</p><p>Federal funds received due to the Connecticut Forest Action Plan contribute to several programs in Connecticut, including the Forest Fire Protection Program, Forest Stewardship Program, Urban Forestry Program, and the Forest Legacy Program within DEEP Forestry, as well as the Forest Health Program administered by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. These programs have received nearly $5 million since Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.</p><p>Connecticut's Forest Action Plan serves as a guide for DEEP Forestry and hopefully inspires others to improve and protect Connecticut's forest resources for future generations. It aims to identify issues and prioritize important areas, values, and needs; it analyzes current conditions and trends of Connecticut's forest resources; and it lays out strategies and action steps to best plan for the future of the forested landscape. It is the result of collaboration with many partners and stakeholders.</p><p>The Connecticut Forest Action Plan also provides guidance for DEEP and partner organizations to apply for competitive grants through the USDA Forest Service.

By night, or anytime a wildfire breaks out or spreads to State forests, some of the approximately 140 DOFAW employees statewide subject to fire call-out grab their gear and firefighting apparatus and head out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of the time Ryan Peralta is a DOFAW Forest Management Supervisor but he has decades of experience battling wildfires. Many times, he is the incident commander on the scene, directing crews and equipment to hot spots and flare-ups.</p><p>\"The people who work for DOFAW want to be in the forest and working with wildlife. Instead of planting trees we may be putting out a fire. Instead of releasing game birds, we may be fighting fires. We like it, but it is sad to see the damage fires do to the forest and watershed,\" Peralta said.</p><p>Over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, as many as twenty DOFAW firefighters were helping bring a fire under control in Kalihi, which had spread into the Honolulu Forest Reserve.</p><p>The tools of their trade include shovels, portable and truck-mounted water tanks, Pulaski's, helicopters and a ton of common sense and training in how to safely fight the flames.</p><p>Peralta cites the Chapter 185 land-fire law, which makes the DOFAW firefighters the first and primary responders for fires in all forest reserves, natural area reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and any lands under the jurisdiction of the division.</p><p>Mike Walker is the State Protection Forester who is responsible for the management and administration of the DOFAW fire team. He expanded on the training staffers need. \"At a minimum they need to be trained in basic wildland firefighting by passing two courses from the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, which sets the standards nationwide for wildfire training. Many of our staff are also trained in helicopter operations, as well having other specialized and leadership training,\" Walker explained.</p><p>Firefighting no matter what kind structure or wildland, is physically demanding, dirty, smokey, and at times, dangerous work. This is why safety is always the key consideration and firefighter training focuses greatly on how to work safely.</p><p>One of the major differences between municipal fire departments and the wildland fire team, as Peralta points out, is structure fires are typically much shorter in duration. A forest fire can burn for days or even weeks. \"It is tough work. Long hours and a lot of physical, hard labor and a lot of looking at the same person constantly until the fire is out. We go everyday until the fire is out. The principles are the same, put the wet stuff on the red stuff, just be careful and do what you got to do,\" Peralta commented.</p><p>The Kalihi area blaze, called the Kahauiki Last Char fire burned an estimated 50 acres. Not large by mainland standards, but as a percentage of total land mass, Hawai'i loses as much acreage to wildfires each year as most western states. Climate change experts predict in the coming decades the world will see higher frequencies of wildfires and more ferocious ones.</p><p>In Hawai'i, like most other places, there is no longer a fire season. Now, fires can and do start every month of the year here and elsewhere. Most of the fires the DOFAW team fights are as the result of unattended campfires out in the forest. This latest fire is more unusual in that it burned in what's called the wildland-urban interface, called WUI in the firefighting community.</p><p>\"It started above apartments, topped the ridge, and was beginning to slop over an access road on the other side and could have reached hundreds of homes at Ft. Shafter. For fires in the WUI we do play a role in protecting structures and of course lives,\" said Jason Misaki, the Kahauiki Last Char fire incident commander.</p><p>His \"regular job\" is the DOFAW O'ahu Branch Wildlife Program Manager. \"It's football season. I watch a lot of football, but if we get a call on a Sunday, it's let's go...let's get out there and get to work. Everybody comes together and everybody is enthusiastic and passionate about doing the job. It's game day every time,\" Misaki said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124870999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6469-BKD1-JCBF-S0WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On a go-forward basis, with the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") acquisition in Ireland now closed, approximately 40% of our gas is now priced off of European gas benchmarks.Repurchased 1.6 million common shares for $30 million and declared cash dividends of $16 million, for a total of $46 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. In conjunction with our Q1 2023 release, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, payable on July 17, 2023 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2023. The base dividend was increased by 25% in Q1 2023, and has increased 67% from Q1 2022 to the current $0.10 per share per quarter.Q1 2023 production averaged 82,455 boe/d(8) a decrease of 4% from the previous quarter due to unplanned downtime in Australia, partially offset by new well production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada.Q1 2023 Montney drilling program delivered positive results as we continue to optimize the drilling and completion methods. The most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(15) (51% liquids).On March 31, 2023 we successfully closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% interest in Corrib, increasing Vermilion's operated interest to 56.5%. The acquisition adds approximately 7,000 boe/d of premium-priced, high netback, low emission European natural gas production, further strengthening Vermilion's international portfolio. The acquisition makes Vermilion the largest provider of domestic natural gas in Ireland.Made significant progress on our asset high-grading strategy during Q1 2023 with the closing of the Corrib acquisition and divestment of select non-core assets in southeast Saskatchewan. These asset high-grading initiatives serve to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.</emphasis></p><p>Message to Shareholders</p><p>The first quarter of 2023 was an active quarter for Vermilion, as we executed our winter drilling program in Canada while also closing two strategic transactions to further high-grade our portfolio. We invested $155 million of exploration and development capital during Q1 2023, primarily focused on our winter drilling campaign in Canada, which included drilling and completion activity in Alberta, British Columbia and southeast Saskatchewan. We continue to make significant progress on our Montney development through further optimization of the drilling and completion process. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). In addition, we completed the sale of select southeast Saskatchewan assets during the quarter and closed the acquisition of an incremental 36.5% ownership in the Corrib Natural Gas Project (\"Corrib\") in Ireland. These two transactions, combined with the Mica Montney acquisition completed in 2022, were all part of our asset high-grading strategy, which serves to position Vermilion for long-term success by increasing our exposure to premium-priced European gas, expanding our North American inventory, redirecting capital to higher rate of return projects, and reducing our operating cost structure and asset retirement obligations.</p><p>Production in the first quarter averaged 82,455 boe/d, which included the impact of Australia maintenance downtime as previously reported. We generated $253 million of fund flows from operations (\"FFO\") in Q1 2023, resulting in $98 million of free cash flow (\"FCF\"), which was used to fund our base dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. Including the dividend and share repurchases, we returned over $46 million of capital to our shareholders. Net debt of $1.37 billion at the end of Q1 2023, represented 0.9 times trailing FFO.</p><p>We will continue to allocate the majority of FCF to debt reduction until we achieve our next net debt target of $1 billion. The majority of the incremental capital return beyond the base dividend will be in the form of share buybacks, as we believe our common shares remain significantly undervalued. To date, we have repurchased 2.2 million common shares in 2023 and 4.6 million in total under our existing NCIB. We plan to renew our NCIB in July 2023 and based on our current pace of share repurchases and base dividend, we anticipate returning 25% to 30% of FCF to shareholders in 2023, depending on commodity prices. Once we achieve our $1 billion debt target we plan to increase our return of capital to shareholders and will communicate the specific targets at that time.</p><p>Over the past two years we have focused on strengthening the balance sheet and high-grading the asset base to position Vermilion for long-term success. We have made significant progress on both of these fronts, and while we will continue to advance these initiatives, we will now place an even greater focus on operational execution throughout our asset base. In Canada, we will continue to develop and grow our strategic Montney position where we are seeing very encouraging results from recently drilled wells. In the United States we will continue to develop and grow our Turner oil play in the Powder River Basin while also testing new prospects across our Wyoming land base, including the Niobrara and Parkman formations. In Europe, we will continue to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany and new gas development in Croatia. We have a large land base with significant gas resource potential in both Germany and Croatia and we will continue to work with the respective governments in each country to identify opportunities for Vermilion to assist in developing their domestic supply of natural gas.</p><p>Q1 2023 Operations Review</p><p>North America</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 60,046 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter primarily due to new production from our Alberta Deep Basin and Montney assets in Canada. In Alberta, we drilled seven (3.1 net), completed ten (6.3 net), and brought on production nine (7.6 net) Mannville liquids rich conventional natural gas wells, while at Mica we drilled six (6.0 net), completed five (5.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) Montney liquids rich shale gas wells. We also completed two small tuck-in acquisitions within our Montney and Alberta Deep Basin assets during the quarter.</p><p>We continue to focus on optimizing the drilling and completion process on our Mica Montney assets and are seeing improved results from new wells. Our most recent two (2.0 net) wells drilled on our British Columbia lands were tied-in during the second half of March 2023 and produced at an average IP30 rate of 1,250 boe/d(1) (51% liquids). We are encouraged by these recent results and we continue to work through the permitting process for the planned 16,000 boe/d battery in British Columbia, which will facilitate the next phase of expansion on our Montney asset. We received one additional permit in Q1 2023 and are confident we will receive the remaining permit required to proceed with the construction of the battery in the near future.</p><p>In Saskatchewan, we drilled three (3.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production four (4.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells. In the United States, we drilled five (2.1 net), completed two (0.7 net), and brought on production two (0.7 net) light and medium crude oil wells in Wyoming. All of the wells drilled in the United States were two-mile lateral wells, which are significantly more economic than one-mile laterals. During the quarter we participated in two non-operated Parkman wells and one non-operated Niobrara well, the results from which will enhance our understanding of these formations as it relates to future development prospects on our Powder River Basin acreage in Wyoming. We have a large land base with approximately 15,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for the Niobrara and the Parkman formations. Our six (5.3 net) well operated Turner drilling program is currently underway with all wells expected to be completed and on-stream by the third quarter.</p><p>International</p><p>Production from our International operations averaged 22,408 boe/d(2) in Q1 2023, a decrease of 17% from the prior quarter, primarily due to unplanned downtime in Australia, which was offline during the first quarter for maintenance. In Europe, production in the Netherlands increased over the prior quarter due to volumes from a new well brought online during the quarter, and production in France was fully restored following forest fire-related downtime in the second half of 2022. A nationwide strike in France affected several of the refineries in France in late March and April; however, the strike has not had any material impact on our operations.</p><p>In Germany, we drilled two (2.0 net), completed three (3.0 net), and brought on production three (3.0 net) light and medium crude oil wells during the quarter. We also continued to advance our deep gas exploration and development plans in Germany as we prepare for our first well to be drilled in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the Netherlands, we completed and brought on production one (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well from our Q4 2022 drilling campaign. We also drilled the first (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well of our two (1.0 net) well 2023 program and commenced drilling of the second (0.5 net) conventional natural gas well late in the quarter. The first well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, however initial results from the second well look encouraging, with an approximately 10 metre gas column identified. In Australia, maintenance work on the Wandoo platform progressed as planned through the first quarter. To date, we have performed over 95% of the inspections and completed repairs where necessary to ensure we operate with the highest safety standards. Much of the identified repair work resulting from the inspections is preemptive, which we expect to result in higher operational run-rates with less unplanned downtime in the future. In early April, a cyclone entered the region which forced us to evacuate the offshore platform and temporarily halt maintenance operations. While there was no physical damage to the platform, the evacuation occurred during final maintenance work and will now require additional time to reorganize and complete the remaining inspections. As a result, we now anticipate production to remain offline for most of the second quarter.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance Update</p><p>With most of our Canadian assets currently under spring break-up restrictions, our second quarter drilling and completion activity has shifted to the United States. In addition to our Q1 2023 drilling activity, we plan to drill five (4.4 net) wells targeting the Turner Sands and participate in six (1.5 net) wells targeting the Parkman sands and Niobrara shale formations over the remainder of 2023. As noted above, our Australia maintenance program has been extended into late Q2 2023 due to severe cyclone activity in the region. Taking into account the acquisition and divestiture transactions that closed in Q1 2023, the delayed start-up of Australia production and our planned activity in Q2 2023, we expect Q2 2023 production to average 84,000 to 86,000 boe/d. Our 2023 annual production guidance of 82,000 to 86,000 boe/d and capital budget of $570 million remain unchanged.</p><p>Commodity Hedging</p><p>Vermilion hedges to manage commodity price exposures and increase the stability of our cash flows. In aggregate, as of May 3, 2023, we have 15% of our expected net-of-royalty production hedged for the remainder of 2023. With respect to individual commodity products, we have hedged 49% of our European natural gas production, 0% of our crude oil production, and 13% of our North American natural gas volumes for the remainder of 2023, respectively.

These financial measures include:</p><p>Total of Segments Measures</p><p>Fund flows from operations (FFO):\u00a0Most directly comparable to net earnings, FFO is comprised of sales excluding royalties, transportation, operating, G&amp;A, corporate income tax, PRRT, windfall taxes, interest expense, realized loss on derivatives, realized foreign exchange gain (loss), and realized other income. The measure is used to assess the contribution of each business unit to Vermilion's ability to generate income necessary to pay dividends, repay debt, fund asset retirement obligations and make capital investments.</p><p>Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Ratios</p><p>Free cash flow (FCF):Most directly comparable to cash flows from operating activities, FCF is comprised of fund flows from operations less drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs. The measure is used to determine the funding available for investing and financing activities including payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, reallocation into existing business units and deployment into new ventures.</p><p>Adjusted working capital:\u00a0Defined as current assets less current liabilities, excluding current derivatives and current lease liabilities. The measure is used to calculate net debt, a capital measure disclosed above.</p><p>Capital expenditures:\u00a0Calculated as the sum of drilling and development costs and exploration and evaluation costs from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. We consider capital expenditures to be a useful measure of our investment in our existing asset base. Capital expenditures are also referred to as E&amp;D capital.</p><p>Operating netback:\u00a0Most directly comparable to net earnings and is calculated as sales less royalties, operating expense, transportation costs, PRRT, and realized hedging gains and losses presented on a per unit basis. Management assesses operating netback as a measure of the profitability and efficiency of our field operations.</p><p>Payout and payout % of FFO:\u00a0A non-GAAP financial measure and non-GAAP ratio respectively most directly comparable to dividends declared. Payout is comprised of dividends declared plus drilling and development costs, exploration and evaluation costs, and asset retirement obligations settled. The measure is used to assess the amount of cash distributed back to shareholders and reinvested in the business for maintaining production and organic growth. The reconciliation of the measure to primary financial statement measure can be found below. Management uses payout and payout as a percentage of FFO (also referred to as the payout or sustainability ratio).</p><p>Acquisitions:The sum of acquisitions and acquisitions of securities from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Vermilion common shares issued as consideration, the estimated value of contingent consideration, the amount of acquiree's outstanding long-term debt assumed, and net acquired working capital deficit or surplus. We believe that including these components provides a useful measure of the economic investment associated with our acquisition activity and is most directly comparable to cash flows used in investing activities. A reconciliation to the acquisitions line items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows can be found below.</p><p>Capital Management Measure</p><p>Net debt:\u00a0Is in accordance with IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" and is most directly comparable to long-term debt. Net debt is comprised of long-term debt (excluding unrealized foreign exchange on swapped USD borrowings) plus adjusted working capital and represents Vermilion's net financing obligations after adjusting for the timing of working capital fluctuations.</p><p>Supplementary Financial Measures</p><p>Net debt to four quarter trailing fund flows from operations:Calculated as net debt (capital management measure) over the FFO (total of segments measure) from the preceding four quarters. The measure is used to assess the ability to repay debt.</p><p>Dividends % of FFO:\u00a0Calculated as dividends declared divided by FFO (total of segments measure). The measure is used by management as a metric to assess the cash distributed to shareholders.</p><p>Fund flows from operations per boe:\u00a0Calculated as FFO (total of segments measure) by boe production. Fund flows from operations per boe is used by management to assess the profitability of our business units and Vermilion as a whole.</p><p>Management's Discussion and Analysis and Consolidated Financial Statements</p><p>To view Vermilion's Management's Discussion and Analysis and Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, please refer to SEDAR (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">http://www.sedar.com</url>) or Vermilion's website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.vermilionenergy.com\">http://www.vermilionenergy.com</url>.</p><p>Vermilion will hold its Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2023 at 3:00 pm MT.

In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; and management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities.</p><p>Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation; health, safety, and environmental risks; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against or involving Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities.</p><p>The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.</p><p>Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CA89518&amp;sd=2023-05-03\"/> View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vermilion-energy-inc-announces-results-for-the-three-months-ended-march-31-2023-301815124.html</p><p>SOURCE Vermilion Energy Inc.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CA89518&amp;Transmission_Id=202305031605PR_NEWS_USPR_____CA89518&amp;DateId=20230503\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Dion Hatcher, President &amp;

The forest includes more than 60,000 acres stretching from Ohiopyle north through Somerset and Westmoreland counties. </p><p>The first fire, along Dunbar Road in a state game lands, was reported just after 5 p.m. Thursday and consumed more than 250 acres before firefighters were able to extinguish the flames around 1 a.m. Friday, Fayette County 911 officials said. </p><p>A second fire was reported a short time later near Victoria Flats and Rock Spring roads. That blaze destroyed more than 200 acres of woods along the Youghiogheny River before crews were able to get it under control. </p><p>\"We've had large fires before, and this one is a very large forest fire for Pennsylvania. We've had fires that large before in that Victoria Flats area ... approximately 10 years ago,\" Callahan said. </p><p>\"That Victoria Flats area has been a problem area because of the railroad tracks that go through there. Now, we haven't had a chance to determine official cause because we've been working fighting the fires, but with that railroad track running through there when it's dry ... a spark from a train can set it off,\" Callahan said. </p><p>Jessica Kruse of Falls Market General Store in Ohiopyle doubted tourism would be impacted. She said visitors couldn't see the charred terrain from the popular falls area in the borough. </p><p>\"Yesterday afternoon there was smoke, but today it's back to normal,\" said Kruse, who is also a borough councilwoman. </p><p>According to Callahan, the gusty winds that blew through the area Thursday helped spread the fires. </p><p>\"Those strong wind gusts really make it spread fast,\" he said. </p><p>Park officials said 74 crews from departments in Westmoreland and Fayette counties responded to the incidents along with teams from the state's forestry department. </p><p>\"Our crews worked throughout the night. The rain certainly did help, but I'm told they did not get as much rain down there as we got in parts of Westmoreland County,\" said Callahan, who works out of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Forestry office in Laughlintown, Westmoreland County. </p><p>No injuries were reported. </p><p>\"There was one structure in the Victoria Flats area we were concerned about, but it made it OK,\" Callahan said. </p><p>Crews were working Friday putting out smoldering spots and cutting tree limbs that were still burning. </p><p>\"We hope to be completely wrapped up by Friday evening, and then we'll work on determining the causes,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-3731068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DM-4941-JBXT-N517-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 9, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

These burns are conducted for the purpose of reducing potential for large wildfires, decreasing unwanted vegetation and to improve the overall health of your national forests in Alabama. Fire managers expect a limited window of suitable weather to conduct prescribed burns. They are asking the public to check the National Forests in Alabamas Facebook page for the latest updates regarding any planned burns.</p><p>Prescribed burning is only conducted when factors such as resource availability, air quality, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and fuel moisture levels are ideal. All burns are done under carefully planned prescriptions and protocols to eliminate the risk of an escaped fire and smoke exposure to communities.</p><p>\"Our prescribed burning program is a targeted approach to reducing flammable vegetation on the landscape known as 'fuels' that build up on the forest floor and can feed large wildfires. Reducing these fuels can also reduce future smoke impacts in our communities,\" said Joe Smith, forest fire management officer with the National Forests in Alabama. \"This year's historic wildfire season in the Northwest and Mountain Region of the United States has highlighted the importance of proper forest management and the use of fire on a prescribed basis is an important part of that management.</p><p>Prescribed burning is one method of reducing hazardous fuels and helps reduce wildfire risk to communities, enhances wildlife habitats, recycles nutrients that increase soil productivity and overall increases resiliency of treated forests to endure wildfire effects. Since prescribed burn operations are planned in advance, they have critical safety components in place and are carefully designed to occur within a combination of natural and constructed control lines. In 2020, we have increased coordination measures regarding COVID-19 mitigation.</p><p>During a prescribed burn, some smoke may be visible around the burn areas. When smoke is present, motorists should reduce speeds and turn on headlights. Exact dates will depend on weather and moisture conditions that best allow the appropriate level of burn intensity, and smoke management to meet objectives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124099105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61C6-5KS1-DYTH-G219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 23, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This opportunity will support Edgybees' efforts to deliver real-time, high-precision geo-tagging for aerial images and video that provide timely and accurate situational awareness for mission-critical operations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New for 2021, the four-week AWS Space Accelerator curriculum provides hands-on AWS Cloud and technical training, mentorship, coaching, and business support in collaboration with Seraphim, one of the world's leading investment groups focused exclusively on the space industry, who will provide business development and investment guidance.</p><p>The explosion of aerial assets such as drones, helicopters, and airplanes has expanded the availability of imagery and video during critical missions such as natural disasters, emergency incidents, and precision military operations. Yet despite massive investments in excess of a trillion dollars a year, the vast majority of aerial imagery and video footage go unused due to lack of accurate geographical context.</p><p>Since telemetry data from the aerial assets themselves is notoriously inaccurate, erroneous information is often displayed to pilots and operators who are making crucial decisions under pressure with life or death consequences. Lacking accurate geolocation information, operators may struggle to pinpoint the location of a trapped family in a hurricane, a hiker lost in a remote area, or a residential building in a forest fire area.</p><p>Edgybees helps solve this problem by analyzing incoming visual information and matching it with real-time GIS telemetry, with accuracy as high as 1 meter and as little as 120 milliseconds latency.</p><p>Unlike other solutions that require expensive proprietary GIS data, the Edgybees solution is utilizing commercial-grade satellite-generated GIS data, making the solution highly affordable and generating additional revenue streams for satellite operators. Optimized for the cloud, the Edgybees software and APIs have been successfully deployed on the AWS cloud platform with major defense integrators and customers across the globe.</p><p>\"We are extremely excited to be selected for the AWS Space Accelerator and collaborate with AWS to deliver advanced decision-support solutions at the scale and speed that are a must for lifesaving and mission-critical operations,\" said Adam Kaplan, Edgybees' co-founder and CEO.</p><p>\"Running on AWS streamlines the integration of our software into existing systems used by customers, delivering immediate improvement of their geo-registration accuracy and reliability without modifying their workflows and operating procedures.\"</p><p>As one of 10 companies chosen for this opportunity, Edgybees will receive up to $100,000 in AWS Activate credit, AWS Cloud training and support, mentorship, and additional business development resources including opportunities to speak with space-savvy venture investors.</p><p>\"AWS looks forward to collaborating with our finalists to advance their inspiring vision for transforming how we understand, operate in, and benefit from space,\" said Clint Crosier, director of the Aerospace and Satellite business at AWS.</p><p>\"Congratulations to our finalists, who were selected from hundreds of impressive startups from across the global space industry. The cloud is uniquely suited to spur the success of space companies in so many ways, and we are excited to help these companies achieve their biggest goals.\"</p><p>Proposals were judged on several factors including the innovative and unique nature of the project, the overall value the solution will bring to the space industry, the creative application of AWS to solve problems, and the team's ability to deliver on its specific mission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202106180056467384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y5-HVR1-JC3D-Y35J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 18, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>edgybees-selected-to-participate-in-inaugural-aws-space-accelerator-for-startups</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNH0</classCode><className>GEOSPATIAL DATA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009S4D</classCode><className>BUSINESS COACHING &amp;

The forest includes more than 60,000 acres stretching from Ohiopyle north through Somerset and Westmoreland counties. </p><p>The first fire, along Dunbar Road in a state game lands, was reported just after 5 p.m. Thursday and consumed more than 250 acres before firefighters were able to extinguish the flames about 1 a.m. Friday, Fayette County 911 officials said. </p><p>A second fire was reported a short time later near Victoria Flats and Rock Spring roads. That blaze destroyed more than 200 acres of woods along the Youghiogheny River before crews were able to get it under control. </p><p>\"We've had large fires before, and this one is a very large forest fire for Pennsylvania. We've had fires that large before in that Victoria Flats area ... approximately 10 years ago,\" Callahan said. </p><p>\"That Victoria Flats area has been a problem area because of the railroad tracks that go through there. Now, we haven't had a chance to determine official cause because we've been working fighting the fires, but with that railroad track running through there when it's dry ... a spark from a train can set it off,\" Callahan said. </p><p>Jessica Kruse of Falls Market General Store in Ohiopyle doubted tourism would be impacted. She said visitors couldn't see the charred terrain from the popular falls area in the borough. </p><p>\"Yesterday afternoon there was smoke, but today it's back to normal,\" said Kruse, who is also a borough councilwoman. </p><p>According to Callahan, the gusty winds that blew through the area Thursday helped spread the fires. </p><p>\"Those strong wind gusts really make it spread fast,\" he said. </p><p>Park officials said 74 crews from departments in Westmoreland and Fayette counties responded to the incidents along with teams from the state's forestry department. </p><p>\"Our crews worked throughout the night. The rain certainly did help, but I'm told they did not get as much rain down there as we got in parts of Westmoreland County,\" said Callahan, who works out of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Forestry office in Laughlintown, Westmoreland County. </p><p>No injuries were reported. </p><p>\"There was one structure in the Victoria Flats area we were concerned about, but it made it OK,\" Callahan said. </p><p>Crews were working Friday putting out smoldering spots and cutting tree limbs that were still burning. </p><p>\"We hope to be completely wrapped up by Friday evening, and then we'll work on determining the causes,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-3729097</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DM-4941-JBXT-N50M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 9, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The results suggest that a versatile quantum-optical platform could be used to explore this far-reaching model of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in a controlled way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Figure 1 | The universal dynamics of interface growth.</emphasis> The Kardar\u2013Parisi\u2013Zhang (KPZ) equation describes the dynamics of interfaces in a range of diverse systems, from wildfire fronts to bacterial-colony expansion.

The resulting quasiparticles are bosons \u2014 the term for particles that can occupy the same quantum state \u2014 and if enough of these quasiparticles are in the same state, their microscopic quantum behaviour starts to become apparent on a macroscopic scale, in a phenomenon known as Bose\u2013Einstein condensation4.</p><p>Read the paper: Kardar\u2013Parisi\u2013Zhang universality in a one-dimensional polariton condensate</p><p>Polariton condensates have a close cousin in ensembles of atoms, but only when the atoms have been cooled to temperatures in the range of 100 nanokelvin \u2014 whereas polaritons condense in the cryogenic regime of a few kelvin. Aside from this 10-million-fold quantitative difference in temperature, there is a subtler qualitative distinction between these two condensation scenarios: ultracold atoms are in thermodynamic equilibrium, whereas polaritons are out-of-equilibrium systems. This means that creating a system of polaritons that is dense enough to form a condensate requires an experiment that balances fluxes in and out of the system. Any light lost through the system of mirrors must be replenished by injecting quasiparticles into the system, through a suitable pumping scheme.</p><p>So condensation can take place in both systems, and relies only on the atoms or quasiparticles behaving like bosons. But does this mean that these systems will display identical phenomena? In other words, does the fact that the polaritons are out of equilibrium on a microscopic scale mean that their behaviour will differ from that of the ultracold atoms on a macroscopic scale, where experimental observations are made? The answer is yes, and this is where the KPZ equation kicks in: the long-distance properties of polariton condensates are governed by a measure of the wave-like nature of the quasiparticles called phase. And the stochastic dynamics of this phase map to the KPZ equation5,6.</p><p>Originally, the KPZ equation was derived to describe the dynamics of driven interfaces, such as the edge of an expanding bacterial colony6\u20138. Such systems are markedly different from interfaces that are not driven, and the two types of system fall into different universality classes. This is the term used in statistical physics to describe groups of systems that share the same macroscopic properties despite having differences in their microscopic details. The KPZ equation captures the non-equilibrium nature of a driven system in a single nonlinear term. By contrast, in an undriven system at equilibrium, this term becomes zero \u2014 in effect, putting the two types of system into different universality classes.</p><p>The idea that polariton condensates belong to the KPZ universality class was proposed some time ago5,6, but experimental evidence for this has proved elusive \u2014 until now. Fontaine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> constructed a one-dimensional lattice made of etched micropillars in a semiconductor material that they set up in a system of mirrors. By using an interferometric device that detects photons, they mapped out the way in which the behaviour of single polaritons was correlated in space and time. A careful study of these correlations revealed behaviour characteristic of the KPZ universality class.</p><p>Hybrid light\u2013matter states formed in self-assembling cavities</p><p>The authors also compared their experimental data with extensive numerical simulations using a model for both the pumping reservoir and the polaritons, with parameters determined through their experiments. The model produces another feature characteristic of the KPZ universality class: fluctuations in the phase are governed by a probability function known as the Tracy\u2013Widom distribution. This behaviour suggests that the system would remain in the KPZ universality class even if topological defects in the phase of the polaritons were introduced, at least in the range of parameters studied by Fontaine and colleagues. However, it remains a challenge for the future to explore this feature experimentally.</p><p>As with many scientific advances, the authors\u2019 achievement was made possible by an ingenious approach to a technical problem that had prevented previous observation of KPZ physics in a polariton condensate. The difficulty arises from a phenomenon called condensate fragmentation, in which correlations in the phase of the polaritons break down at separations well below the system size, severely limiting the distances over which KPZ behaviour can be observed. This effect is a result of attractive interactions between the polaritons, so one way around it involves engineering a system in which these interactions are repulsive. Instead, Fontaine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">et al.</emphasis> overcame the problem by forcing their condensates into regimes in which their mass was effectively negative. In combination with negative interaction energies, this amounts to a system with positive mass and stable repulsive interactions that evolves backwards in time.</p><p>Fontaine and colleagues\u2019 experimental developments open up opportunities for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena with polaritons. Two immediate directions for study are intimately connected to the new role for the key variable in the KPZ equation \u2014 phase in place of interface. A first major challenge is the observation of KPZ physics in two spatial dimensions, which has not yet been achieved experimentally, owing to the absence of 2D interfaces in nature9. Recasting the interface in terms of the polariton phase elegantly circumvents this obstacle, but reaching the relevant system size poses a practical challenge.</p><p>The fundamental difference between phase and interface sets another intriguing challenge. Phase is a periodic variable that can develop topological defects, such as vortices, and these defects can drive phase transitions, even in systems comprising a single spatial dimension10. This possibility sets polariton condensates apart from other systems exhibiting KPZ physics, and awaits experimental exploration. All in all, there are clear grounds for hope that exciton\u2013polariton systems will offer a versatile platform for addressing key challenges in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through highly controlled experiments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Read the paper: Kardar\u2013Parisi\u2013Zhang universality in a one-dimensional polariton condensate</p><p>Hybrid light\u2013matter states formed in self-assembling cavities</p><p>Coherent questions</p><p>See all News &amp; Views</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Carusotto, I..

With the State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers leading the incident response in cooperation with the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, New York State Police, Ulster County, and many other State and local partners, the Governor recently deployed additional State assets including personnel and Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Twenty firefighters from Quebec arrived in New York today to support the response. Currently more than 200 firefighters, bulldozer operators, pilots, and other professional staff and volunteers are working to contain the fire that is currently estimated at 160 acres in size.</p><p>\"We continue to track the fire burning at Minnewaska State Park Preserve and are deploying the necessary resources to contain the fire and keep New Yorkers safe,\" Governor Hochul said. \"New York State is not known for the expansive and destructive wildfires seen out West, but they do occur and continue to be a danger, especially with the increase of drought-fueled climate change impacts that require us to be prepared for all types of extreme weather. I urge all New Yorkers to remain vigilant and thank our first responders and service members who are working around the clock to protect our communities.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuSuRhWNk3M\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuSuRhWNk3M</url></p><p>Audio Photos</p><p>The Napanoch Point fire in Minnewaska State Park Preserve started over the weekend as a result of a suspected lightning strike and spread to approximately 160 acres within the park. The rain received overnight Tuesday helped to slow fire spread yesterday and allowed firefighters to construct control lines. The fire may grow due to dry and windy conditions expected over the next several days. New York State continues to monitor the weather conditions. Two other nearby fires being addressed this week as part of the Shawangunk fire complex, Stony Kill and Wurtsboro, are now fully contained.</p><p>No homes or businesses are impacted by the fire at this time. Out of an abundance of caution to protect homes closest to the fire, DEC Forest Rangers and staff volunteers will be working in the town of Warwarsing near Berme Road to establish a contingency fire line.</p><p>Minnewaska State Park Preserve will be closed to all visitors through Labor Day weekend. The closure will be strictly enforced to protect the health and safety of visitors and allow park staff to focus on fighting the fire. Updates on the Park's status are available here. To find another destination to visit this weekend, check out the New York State Parks website.</p><p>Since the fires began, a coordinated effort of State and local resources has been on the ground attempting to suppress the fires. Firefighters are working in a joint unified command led by State Forest Rangers. Forest Rangers have significant experience in incident command and fire prevention strategies due to extensive training and cooperative wildland firefighting missions to other states . Additional multi-agency resources include New York State Police Aviation, which has committed two helicopters and four pilots each day, dropping more than 500 buckets of water since Sunday. Each of the two Army National Guard Black Hawk helicopters has dumped 12 buckets of water every hour, a total of 24,600 gallon buckets, since being deployed Tuesday and remain on standby to assist. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services has also dispatched the State's Incident Management Team and several emergency communications experts to provide further support. The State Office of Fire Prevention and Control activated the State's Fire Mobilization and Mutual Aid Plan and Fire Operations Center to ensure the timely coordination of additional resources.</p><p>Twenty firefighters from Quebec, Canada, secured through the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact, arrived today. The Compact, established in the 1940s, provides the means for its member states and provinces to cope with fires that might be beyond the capabilities of a single member through information, technology and resource sharing (mutual aid) activities.</p><p>I urge all New Yorkers to remain vigilant and thank our first responders and service members who are working around the clock to protect our communities.\"</p><p>Governor Kathy Hochul</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \" Seeing the fire's damage firsthand gives a deep appreciation for the incredible effort DEC's Forest Rangers are leading, as the professional and volunteer wildland firefighters and our many state, federal, and local partners address these difficult conditions. New York is grateful for the help of new forces from Quebec and the 109th Airlift Wing, and wish everyone a safe and successful mission. I also thank the community for their support of all those working to fight the fire.\"</p><p>New York State Parks Commissioner Erik Kulleseid said, \"I continue to be impressed by and grateful to the our park staff, partner agencies , and volunteers who working hard to fight this fire. The best way to support their work is to stay away until Minnewaska is again safe to visit. This weekend, please find another place to enjoy.\"</p><p>New York StateHomeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, \"Our state agencies and local partners are working hand in hand to battle these fires and they can continue to count on DHSES for assistance and coordination until the fires are out. Fire danger remains high in the Mid-Hudson Region and I urge New Yorkers to remain vigilant and stay safe.\"</p><p>New York State Police Superintendent Kevin P. Bruen said, \"I commend the tireless efforts of our Aviation Unit and state and local partners in combating this fire to prevent further devastation in the park preserve. We will continue to provide resources as needed until the fire is brought under control.\"</p><p>Major General Raymond Shields, the Adjutant General for New York, said, \" The men and women of the New York National Guard are happy that we could assist in dealing with this fire. Our helicopter air crews dropped more than 52,000 gallons of water on the fire to get it under control, and our New York Air National Guard wildland fire crew is currently working side-by-side on the fire line. We are always happy when we can help out fellow New Yorkers.\"</p><p>Ulster County Executive Patrick K. Ryan said, \" On behalf of our entire community, I want to thank the hundreds of brave firefighters and first responders risking their lives to fight this wildfire and keep us safe. I'd also like to thank Governor Hochul for her rapid response and strong leadership, as well as all of our state, local, and international partners who have mobilized to help us in our time of need. I'm very proud that in response to yet another tragic natural disaster in Ulster County, our entire community is coming together to protect and care for each other.\"</p><p>Wawarsing Town Supervisor Terry Houck said, \" I've been very impressed with the coordinated response by state and local agencies who have been battling this wildfire for the past few days. I want to thank all of the first responders and the volunteer firemen and women who have done an incredible job fighting the fire. I also want to thank the countless community members for bringing food and water to our brave first responders. We can't thank you all enough.\"</p><p>New York's Hudson Valley and Catskill regions remain at high fire danger risk ( view the current Fire Danger Map), meaning outdoor fires have the potential to spread quickly, especially if the wind picks up. Fires may become serious and difficult to control unless successfully contained while small.</p><p>All campfires and open burning are currently banned in Mid-Hudson Region State Parks. Check parks.ny.gov for more information.</p><p>DEC continues to encourage New Yorkers and visitors to follow fire safety tips to reduce the risk of wildfires.

And he was like, 'Oh, we just got Machine Gun Kelly,' and immediately, I was like, 'Uh oh.' Yeah, because I knew - I could feel that some wild s*** was going to happen to me from that meeting, but I wasn't yet sure what. I just felt it like, deep in my soul - that something was going to come from that. So then, we met on set. I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame.\"Instead of a soul mate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time. So we're actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away. I think it was the second day [of filming]. I asked him to come into my trailer for lunch, and I put him through all of this astrology stuff. I went deep right away. I knew before I even did his chart, I said to him, he has a Pisces moon. I could tell by his energy.\"</p><p>This article originally ran on celebretainment.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4824677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61B0-YSH1-DY7P-T076-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Griffon News: Missouri Western State College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 17, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>St Joseph</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A4XT</classCode><className>MOVIE FILMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS141</classCode><className>MISSOURI, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(AZ-04) made the following statement after the United States District Court for the District of Arizona modified an injunction stemming from an ongoing lawsuit regarding Mexican Spotted Owl habitat. This modification will allow eight forest management projects in the Tonto National Forest to resume work.</p><p>\"Today's announcement by the Forest Service that the courts will allow some forest management projects to move forward is welcome news to all Arizonans. Already this season we have seen what damage dangerous fires can do to our forests, while managing these fires has been made even more difficult by the ongoing challenge of COVID-19. Fires burn habitat for all species, regardless of their protected status. The fact that we must beg and plead the courts for the chance to clean our forests, to protect against the habitat and life threatening disaster that is a forest fire, is a direct result of lawsuits from radical environmental groups. We must speed up efforts to clean our forests to make our forests healthier and safer. These actions will protect habitat, will protect species and will save human lives.\"</p><p>Background:</p><p>On September 20, 2019 the U.S. District Court halted forest management activities in 6 national forests in Arizona and New Mexico, including the Tonto National Forest. The court order stated its belief that the Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had not adequately taken into consideration the habitat of the Mexican Spotted Owl when awarding forest management projects.</p><p>The list of projects that can resume can be seen HERE <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=11624-553088\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=11624-553088</url> on attachment 1 and attachment 2 of the document.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3961\">https://gosar.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3961</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHM7240D6N5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-46X1-DYVR-P2SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Paul A. Gosar, R-Arizona, issued the following statement on July 24:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) made the following statement after the United States District Court for the District of Arizona modified an injunction stemming from an ongoing lawsuit regarding Mexican Spotted Owl habitat. This modification will allow eight forest management projects in the Tonto National Forest to resume work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>\"Today's announcement by the Forest Service that the courts will allow some forest management projects to move forward is welcome news to all Arizonans. Already this season we have seen what damage dangerous fires can do to our forests, while managing these fires has been made even more difficult by the ongoing challenge of COVID-19.</p><p>\"Fires burn habitat for all species, regardless of their protected status. The fact that we must beg and plead the courts for the chance to clean our forests, to protect against the habitat and life threatening disaster that is a forest fire, is a direct result of lawsuits from radical environmental groups.</p><p>\"We must speed up efforts to clean our forests to make our forests healthier and safer. These actions will protect habitat, will protect species and will save human lives.\"</p><p>Background:</p><p>On September 20, 2019 the U.S. District Court halted forest management activities in 6 national forests in Arizona and New Mexico, including the Tonto National Forest. The court order stated its belief that the Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had not adequately taken into consideration the habitat of the Mexican Spotted Owl when awarding forest management projects.</p><p>The list of projects that can resume can be seen here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=11624-553088\">https://gosar.house.gov/components/redirect/r.aspx?ID=11624-553088</url>) on attachment 1 and attachment 2 of the document.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7187489 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7187489</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FK-5F41-JC11-149J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"310\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Beginning today, two Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters with three-person crews, capable of dropping 600 gallons of water at a time, have begun aerial operations, while a contingent of five firefighters from the Air National Guard have been deployed. State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers, in cooperation with Ulster County, are serving as Incident Commanders, and more than 200 wildland firefighters and volunteers, including Rangers, local fire response resources, and staff from DEC, Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, New York State Police Aviation, and State Fire are fighting the fire.</p><p>Additionally, 20 Canadian firefighters from Quebec, secured through the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact, are set to arrive on Thursday. The Compact, established in the 1940s, provides the means for its member states and provinces to cope with fires that might be beyond the capabilities of a single member through information, technology and resource sharing (mutual aid) activities.</p><p>\"As wildfires continue to rage through Minnewaska State Park, I urge every New Yorker to take sensible precautions to keep themselves and their families safe,\" Governor Hochul said. \"I thank all of our brave first responders, partner agencies and neighbors who are working around the clock to protect our communities.\"</p><p>The Shawangunk fire complex consists of three fires in the region and the response is being led from the Napanoch incident command. The Napanoch Point fire in Minnewaska State Park Preserve started over the weekend as a result of a suspected lightning strike and is 130 to 150 acres. A smaller fire approximately two miles east of the Napanoch Point fire, named Stony Kill, was detected yesterday and is approximately 0.68 acres. The Wurtsboro fire in the town of Mamakating also started over the weekend and is approx. 70 acres.</p><p>Minnewaska remains closed until further notice. No residences are impacted at this time. Out of an abundance of caution to protect residences closes to the Napanoch Point fire, DEC Forest Rangers and staff volunteers will soon be working in the town of Warwarsing near Berme Road to put a contingency fire line in place. A community meeting will be held at the Ellenville Junior/Senior High School Auditorium at 28 Maple Avenue in Ellenville today, Aug. 30, at 7 p.m. This will be an opportunity for residents and others in the impacted area to ask questions about the coordinated fire response.</p><p>Since the fires began, a coordinated effort of state and local resources has been on the ground attempting to suppress the fires. Firefighters are working in a joint unified command led by State Forest Rangers. Forest Rangers have significant experience in incident command and fire prevention strategies due to their extensive training and cooperative wildland firefighting missions to other states. Additional multi-agency resources include New York State Police Aviation, which has flown two helicopters since Sunday and dropped approximately 120-180 300-gallon buckets of water per day. Each of the two National Guard Black Hawk helicopters have dumped 12 buckets of water every hour, a total of 24,600 gallon buckets, since being deployed. The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services has also dispatched the State's Incident Management Team and several emergency communications experts to provide further support. The State Office of Fire Prevention and Control activated the State's Fire Mobilization and Mutual Aid Plan and Fire Operations Center to ensure the timely coordination of additional resources.</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, \"On the ground and in the air, DEC's Forest Rangers and expert wildland firefighters are putting into practice hours spent battling wildland fires here in New York and in western states. These firefighters are focused on protecting the public and working to contain the fire. Until we get significant rainfall, these fires are going to keep burning. We need everyone to do their part and be careful with fire. While this fire started with a lightning strike, most of the fires we've seen this summer started with an unattended campfire. If you don't need to build a fire, don't. The extremely dry vegetation can ignite almost immediately.\"</p><p>New York State Parks Commissioner Erik Kulleseid said, \"I am grateful for the many agencies and personnel who have stepped up to protect a treasured natural and recreational resource. Firefighters are working in grueling conditions to contain this fire - dealing with difficult terrain and tough weather conditions. I commend them all for quickly jumping into action to help.\"</p><p>New York StateHomeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said, \"New York's first responders are fully coordinated with our local partners and despite the difficult terrain and weather conditions, these dedicated professionals will not rest until these fires are suppressed. As this situation continues to evolve, we will continue to make every possible resource available to ensure this beautiful state park and surrounding communities are protected.\"</p><p>The State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services is also dispatching the State's Incident Management Team (IMT), as well as emergency communications experts from the Division's Office of Interoperable and Emergency Communications. The IMT is a multi-agency/multi-jurisdictional team that can be deployed or activated when needed to manage an incident or event safely, effectively, and efficiently, regardless of the cause, size, or complexity.</p><p>New York State Police Superintendent Kevin P. Bruen said, \"Our Aviation Unit continues to coordinate with other state and local agencies on the ground to provide air support to help contain the fires. Our pilots have specialized training to fight wildfires and will continue to fly water drop missions as needed until the fires are under control.\"</p><p>Major General Raymond Shields, the Adjutant General for New York, said, \"Members of our New York National Guard conduct training and readied ourselves for potential firefighting support to our first responders. Working alongside our state and local agency partners brings flexibility to the firefighting response. Our military training and capabilities lend themselves for missions such as this and we look towards a quick and safe containment of these fires.\"</p><p>Wawarsing Town Supervisor Terry Houck said, \"Thank you to Governor Hochul, the State agencies, and all the first responders working around the clock to combat the flames on the Shawangunk Ridge. Our community is grateful for the work being done to keep our citizens safe.\"</p><p>Ulster County Executive Patrick K. Ryan said, \"I want to thank Governor Kathy Hochul and all of the first responders who have worked tirelessly during this wildfire,\" County Executive Pat Ryan said. \"We will continue to work to limit the spread of the fire and I ask all residents to be mindful of the dry season that we are in and take necessary precautions to reduce the chances of further fires.\"</p><p>New York State is closely monitoring the weather conditions as a front moves into the State from the west. While some rain may be expected, the amount of rain is not anticipated to have a significant impact and could lead to unfavorable conditions including high winds and lightning strikes.</p><p>New York's Hudson Valley and Catskill regions remain at high fire danger risk (view the current Fire Danger Map), meaning outdoor fires have the potential to spread quickly, especially if the wind picks up. Fires may become serious and difficult to control unless successfully contained while small.</p><p>All campfires and open burning are currently banned in Mid-Hudson Region State Parks. Check parks.ny.gov for more information.</p><p>DEC continues to encourage New Yorkers and visitors to follow the recommendations below to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p>While camping in the backcountry, New Yorkers are advised to:</p><p>Use existing campfire rings where possible.</p><p>Build campfires away from overhanging branches, steep slopes, rotten stumps, logs, dry grass, and leaves. Pile extra wood away from the fire.</p><p>Clear the area around the ring of leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials.</p><p>Never leave a campfire unattended. Even a small breeze could cause the fire to spread quickly.</p><p>For information on open burning and campfire safety in New York, go to DEC's Open Burning in New York and Fire Safety When Camping webpages. For further questions about wildfires, call 1-833-NYS-RANGERS and call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Contact the Governor's Press Office</p><p>Contact us by phone:</p><p>Albany: (518) 474 - 8418</p><p>New York City: (212) 681 - 4640</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125416276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:668R-64R1-DYTH-G0BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 30, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

situation\" on Thursday, a local mayor said, but hundreds of firefighters were still battling to contain new flare-ups. </p><p><br/>Fires fanned by Greece's most severe heatwave in decades -- which authorities have blamed on climate change -- have burnt through nearly 100,000 hectares over the last fortnight, leaving three dead, hundreds homeless, thousands forced to evacuate, and economic and environmental devastation in their wake. <br/>Greek fires devastate local livestock and beehives Photo: AFPTV / Savvas KARMANIOLAS  <br/>\"The fire fronts are still active\" on the island of Evia and the Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula and \"fires are constantly flaring up\" in both areas, a firefighting official told AFP. <br/>And a new fire broke out on Thursday morning in a forested area of Aspropyrgos, 20 kilometres (12 miles) northwest of Athens. <br/>Greece has been devastated by two weeks of relentless wildfires Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/><br/>After weeks of punishing temperatures often well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a lower 33 degrees Celsius was forecast for Thursday. <br/>The falling temperatures and overnight rain in Evia, the Peloponnese and central Greece had helped \"improve the situation,\" said Stathis Koulis, the mayor of Gortynia. <br/>Greek firefighters have been bolstered by overseas reinforcements Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>The village of Gortynia in a mountainous area of Arcadia 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Athens has become the primary focus in the Peloponnese, with deep ravines posing a challenge to firefighters. <br/> Twenty villages have been evacuated in the area over the past few days and 680 firefighters, including more than a hundred sent to help from France, and five water-dropping aircraft have been relentlessly battling the flames. <br/>Greece has only just started counting the cost of the damage caused by the weeks of fires Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Greek firefighters have been bolstered by more than 1,200 reinforcements from numerous countries particularly in Europe, as well as vehicles and equipment. <br/>In just eight days, 568 fires have been recorded across Greece. <br/> Kostis Angelou walks among the goats he lost on the island of Evia Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Nearly 100,000 hectares of forests and farmland have burned since July 29 in Greece's worst wildfires since 2007, the European Forest Fire Information System said. <br/>\"I can't take it anymore,\" said Kostis Angelou as he wandered between the corpses of his goats, all 372 of them burnt by a fire that devoured forests on Evia. <br/>The 44-year-old farmer managed to survive by spending hours under an irrigation water pipe, surrounded by flames. <br/>\"A saint saved me,\" he said. <br/>The Mediterranean has been hit by a savage fire season, with Algeria announcing three days of national mourning starting Thursday for the 69 dead killed in blazes there. <br/>Italy has also been hit by fires, and the island of Sicily recorded 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit) on Wednesday, which if confirmed would be a new European record, beating Greece's previous high. <br/>Eight people were killed in fires in Turkey's south earlier in the month, while in the north the death toll rose to five on Thursday from flash floods that have swept across several Black Sea regions. <br/>The latest extreme weather events come after a \"code red\" report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published on Monday warning that the world is warming far faster than previously feared. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Mike Dunleavy announces his new push into carbon markets at a news conference Thursday at his Anchorage office. (Photo by Nathaniel Herz) <br/>For decades, Alaska's economy has depended on the extraction and harvest of natural resources \u2014 industries like pumping oil out of the ground, and cutting timber. </p><p><br/>Now, Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy wants the state to make money by leaving trees standing, and by pumping carbon emissions back into the ground. <br/>Investment is currently flooding into those kinds of projects, driven by the increasing urgency to slow global warming by cutting human-caused carbon emissions. <br/>Dunleavy has long rejected the scientific consensus that those emissions are causing climate change, and in his first interview detailing his carbon plans, he made clear that his views haven't changed. But, rubbing his thumb and forefinger together, he said the growing markets for carbon storage offer the state something it needs: money. <br/>'On this scale, potentially, we could be a game-changer,' he said. There are 'a lot of people' who believe that carbon emissions are driving global warming, he added, 'and Alaska is here to help them.' <br/>Dunleavy said he will make carbon-related legislation a major priority during the upcoming legislative session \u2014 a commitment underscored by the seven state workers, including his new natural resources commissioner, who participated in the interview Wednesday. <br/>Also present was an employee of GaffneyCline, one of three separate consulting firms supporting the Dunleavy's administration's push. <br/> Enthusiasm and skepticism <br/><br/>There are two types of projects that the governor aims to encourage through his pending legislation, which has not yet been publicly released. <br/>One is known as carbon sequestration and storage[1]. Those projects aim to capture emissions from sources like natural gas processing and ethanol plants, refineries and power plants, instead of allowing emissions to vent to the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. Then, the captured carbon is permanently injected underground, and project sponsors can receive tax credits for every ton locked away. <br/>Carbon credits projects[2], meanwhile, compensate landowners for using natural sources \u2014 usually trees \u2014 to pull carbon out of the atmosphere and store it. The landowners collect credits in exchange for leaving timber stands uncut; those credits can then be sold to companies that are trying to offset their continuing emissions. <br/>Dunleavy's efforts come as federal incentives and growing corporate action on climate change are fueling major growth in both markets. And the governor's new plans are drawing tentative support from others with experience in the industry. <br/>'This market will continue to grow, and we are a resource-rich state without a big population, so we need to be at the table,' said Joe Nelson, co-chair of the Alaska Federation of Natives and chair of the board of the Juneau-based regional Native corporation Sealaska. 'I'm all in favor of the conversation happening sooner rather than later, and bringing the best minds to it.' <br/>Sealaska has proven the potential value of leaving Alaska trees standing: It's collected more than $100 million[3] from carbon credits markets in exchange for preserving 165,000 acres of its timber stands for a century. <br/><br/>Sun shines through the canopy in the Tongass National Forest. (Photo by Brian Logan/U.S. Forest Service) <br/><br/> But Dunleavy's proposal to make similar deals on state land faces skepticism from others, and even some outright opposition. <br/>Anchorage Republican Sen. Cathy Giessel will co-chair the Senate Resources Committee likely to vet the governor's legislation. In a phone interview Wednesday, she said she sees other issues, like schools spending and road plowing, as more urgent for lawmakers. She said she also has many unanswered questions about the governor's carbon proposals. <br/>'Are we locking up our land? What if there's a forest fire and those trees are destroyed? Do we have to reimburse the people who gave us the money?' Giessel asked. 'I don't want to be a naysayer right out of the gate, but it sounds like it's complicated. So, we need more information.' <br/>Indigenous climate activist and consultant Ruth Miller[4], meanwhile, denounced the governor's new plans as 'distractions' from more direct emissions reduction policies like energy conservation and renewable power sources. <br/>Underground carbon storage, which is still generally unproven on a large scale, is 'pretty much a pseudoscience,' she said. And leaving trees standing in exchange for allowing companies to continue emitting carbon doesn't solve the underlying problem. <br/>'It's the invention of a new market and a new language that is going to waste our time at a rate that our planet cannot ecologically bear,' Miller said in a phone interview. 'We need to phase out fossil fuels. Period.' <br/>Dunleavy's new proposals are driven by Alaska's lingering budget deficit, and his administration is looking to carbon markets to generate, annually, hundreds of millions of dollars for the state within a few years. But he also has no interest in seeing reduced oil and gas production, which also sends substantial tax and royalty revenue into Alaska's bank accounts, he said. <br/>'For those that think this a displacer, as opposed to an enhancer and an opportunity, they just don't understand,' he said. <br/> New technology, but growing investment <br/><br/>Storing carbon dioxide underground, rather than allowing it to pollute the atmosphere and accelerate global warming, is becoming a big business. <br/>The growth has stemmed largely from increasingly generous tax incentives authorized by the federal government: For every ton of carbon permanently stored, companies can now earn a credit[5] of up to $85, which President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act increased from $50. <br/>Oil companies already inject carbon back into their underground fields to help produce more petroleum. But newer projects aim to store carbon dioxide by itself, by pumping it into rock formations like those that trap oil. <br/>The technology is still new: As of July, the Environmental Protection Agency still had not issued a single permit for a commercial carbon injection program on a large scale, according to Wired Magazine[6]. But some of the oil industry's biggest players are now pursuing projects, including BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil. <br/>'There's a lot of interest, and there's a lot of money behind these projects, and the developers want them to go through,' said Aaron Tucker[7], a Denver-based attorney who works on permitting for carbon capture initiatives. <br/>Such projects, Tucker added, need the right combination of geology and industrial carbon sources to be viable. <br/>Geologists say that Cook Inlet, the water body adjacent to Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula, could hold substantial amounts of carbon \u2014 including in underground formations where oil has already been pumped out. <br/>'So much fluid has been taken out of those reservoirs, the space has been made available to inject CO2,' said Scott Pantaleone, a former University of Alaska Anchorage student whose geology master's thesis examined Cook Inlet's carbon storage potential[8]. <br/>One concern, Pantaleone said, is that pumping carbon into the inlet could cause earthquakes, like those associated with oil and gas activity in the Lower 48. But he examined that risk[9] and found it to be manageable because of what he described as the relative stability of Cook Inlet's faults. <br/>'It's definitely something, if somebody is injecting into a field, for them to keep in mind and to assess,' he said. 'But I wouldn't start ringing the alarm just yet.' <br/>An advantage for Cook Inlet is that it's relatively close to sources of carbon pollution in Southcentral Alaska, like power plants. But experts say that economically viable projects tend to be linked to purer streams of carbon not currently found in the Anchorage area, like those coming from ethanol or natural gas processing plants. <br/>That could change if Alaska moves ahead with construction of a proposed massive, export-focused natural gas pipeline, which could cost some $40 billion or more. Part of the Dunleavy administration's new contract with GaffneyCline[10], capped at $250,000, calls for the company to help examine the potential for carbon storage projects to pair with the pipeline, to make it more attractive to investors or gas buyers. <br/>A separate contract[11] with global engineering firm Stantec, capped at $500,000, aims to develop the Dunleavy administration's legal and policy framework for its carbon storage program. <br/>Administration officials say the program will be informed by frameworks already adopted by other states. It will likely address questions like how the state leases storage reservoirs, whether the state will accept long-term liability for projects and whether the state or the federal government will assume the primary responsibility for permitting. <br/>Money would most likely come from the leases: Companies would pay the state for the right to use its rocks to store carbon. <br/>'The state owns the pore space,' said Natural Resources Commissioner John Boyle. 'That's our property.' <br/>How much such projects will affect climate change is the subject of intense debate. Some scientists[12] and climate modelers[13] say that carbon capture and storage can be an important component of hitting global emissions targets. <br/>But others argue[14] that it's a way to put off the transformational change needed to reach those targets \u2014 particularly when proven green technologies, like wind and solar power, are plummeting in cost. <br/> Millions of acres of trees <br/><br/>The market for timber-based carbon credits is more developed, as shown by the multi-million dollar deals signed by Sealaska and other Alaska Native corporations. <br/>Those agreements are set up through California's cap-and-trade emissions reduction program, which began about a decade ago and called for that state to reduce its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. <br/>But the California program's legal structure isn't workable for public land like Alaska's, according to a previously unpublished report[15] that the Dunleavy administration commissioned from Anew Climate, a global industry consultant. <br/>That means that in the near-term, Alaska will likely have to look to the fast-growing but largely unregulated 'voluntary market' for credits. Those credits are validated by independent, non-government auditors, and can be bought by companies or other entities trying to hit emissions targets that aren't required by law or regulation. <br/>Much of Alaska's forested land is in the state's interior regions \u2014 outside the area of the carbon-dense rainforest that's been lucrative for Native corporations. <br/>But experts say there's still ample value in conserving the smaller trees in boreal forests \u2014 including in Alaska \u2014 where much of the carbon is stored in the soil. <br/><br/>A tract of boreal forest in the Susitna River valley. (Alaska Department of Fish and Game photo) <br/><br/><br/>'It is a global hotspot for carbon \u2014 there are few places on the planet that have as much,' said Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist for Wild Heritage[16], a forest conservation group. <br/>Dunleavy also stressed the sheer volume of forested state lands that could be legally eligible for a credits program. <br/>'We've identified 45 million potential acres. Just think about that, for a second,' Dunleavy said, conceding that there's 'probably not amazing timber on every acre.' <br/>'Sealaska was 165,000 acres,' he added. 'For millions of dollars.' <br/>Realistically, though, Dunleavy said projects will start out smaller, a point emphasized by the state's report[17]. <br/>It examined three pilot projects totaling roughly 300,000 acres \u2014 one in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, one near Fairbanks and one in forests near Haines in Southeast Alaska \u2014 and found they could generate, collectively, credits worth some $8 million a year for the state. Notably, the report found that the state could still qualify for the credits even if timber harvesting in those areas continues at existing 'sustainable' levels. <br/>One challenge for Dunleavy's administration may be meeting a requirement that credit projects actually save trees from being cut down or otherwise lead to more carbon being sequestered, since a large share of state lands are far from roads or harvesting infrastructure. <br/>To qualify, said Miller, the activist and climate consultant, projects have to prove that 'the trees you save were going to be absolutely, for sure, cut down.' <br/>In spite of her overall opposition to Dunleavy's proposals, Miller said she still sees his ideas as the 'opening of a dialogue' that she welcomes. And she described the spark for that dialogue as a growing consensus about the urgency of moving the global economy away from fossil fuels \u2014 a shift underscored in Alaska by minimal interest in recent oil and gas lease sales[18]. <br/>'I think he's exploring new potentially greener markets, and if that's what it takes to eventually turn the wheels and shift the tide a little bit, great,' Miller said. <br/>But, she added: 'I'm not saying this is the answer.' <br/>This article was originally published in Northern Journal, a newsletter from journalist Nathaniel Herz.

Since November, 73 of Nepal's 77 districts have reported forest fires -- the highest level on record in the past five fire seasons, according to CNN Weather.</p><p>The country has recorded up to 2,087 forest fires nationwide since November 15, 2020, according to the Nepalese Forest Fire Management. And as of March 25, there were still at least 524 active fires burning across the country, spreading a combination of dust, smoke and ash into the air.</p><p>Photos from the capital Kathmandu show streets blanketed in gray smog, the air thick and visibility poor. Images taken Sunday by the European Union's Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite show the valleys east of Kathmandu completely engulfed in smoke.</p><p>A satellite<url normalizedValue=\"https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#t:adv;d:2021-03-27..2021-03-28;l:noaa20-viirs,nrt_noaa20-viirs,nrt_modis_a;@85.0,28.1,8z\"> fire map by NASA</url> shows fire hotspots dotted across the bottom of the Himalayas, with a few creeping up the mountains.</p><p>As the fires rage, the country's air quality has deteriorated. On Tuesday afternoon, Kathmandu had a \"very unhealthy\" score of 225 on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://aqicn.org/city/kathmandu/\">World Air Quality Index,</url> which measures the concentration of different pollutants in the air -- the most important being PM 2.5. This harmful microscopic particulate matter is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and is considered particularly dangerous as it can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream.</p><p>Kathmandu's PM 2.5 levels reached a maximum of 363 micrograms per cubic meter on Tuesday. The World Health Organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe.</p><p>The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology held an emergency meeting on Sunday, where authorities decided to close all schools until Friday due to the pollution and health risks, according to state-run news agency <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.onlineradionepal.gov.np/2021/03/30/152291.html?fbclid=IwAR1zGHjSBeO7srZwwVLrujuTe6BvKf6J-up33GKG1ei6rp1SYnq08XwMF8w\">Radio Nepal. </url></p><p>The pollution from the smoke and ash has been exacerbated by a prolonged drought and a stagnant atmosphere, which means there's nothing to blow or wash away the air pollutants, according to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.onlineradionepal.gov.np/2021/03/30/152369.html?fbclid=IwAR0Ud6d0SuDSI2balcz2iG6KayWa6KPVwtIoxHogTk9jwaWHfRN7hpWoXI0\">Radio Nepal</url>, citing the country's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. The haze will remain for the next few days, the Department added, advising residents to stay indoors and wear a face mask.</p><p>But there is some hope in the immediate forecast. A weak system moving across the area will usher in about a 40% chance of wet weather on Wednesday and Thursday, according to CNN Weather.</p><p>Kathmandu averages around 34 millimeters of rainfall in the month of March, but has only recorded a little over 6 millimeters this month -- so this will be the best chance for rainfall in nearly three weeks.         </p><p>             By Jessie Yeung and Pedram Javaheri, CNN</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
