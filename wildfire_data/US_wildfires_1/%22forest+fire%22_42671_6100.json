Thank you so much for joining me from Washington, D.C. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with the apocalyptic destruction from the deadliest natural disaster in Hawaii's history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 80 people are dead and 1,000s more displaced from the wildfires. And at any moment, Lahaina residents could soon return to assess what might be left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crews are still working to fully contain three major fires and prevent flare ups on Maui. Devastation there, costing an estimated $5.5 billion. One lawmaker says the state underestimated the threat of wildfires and failed to plan for communication issues with the Emergency Alert System.</p><p>Governor Josh Green has ordered a comprehensive review of the state's response.</p><p>Let's go now to CNN's Mike Valerio, who is joining us on Maui.</p><p>And Mike, moments ago, last hour, you were approached by a woman who was very frustrated, upset about the road closures. It looks like things are moving right now. What's been happening there?</p><p>MIKE VALERIO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fredricka, good morning. The sun is now up over Maui. This is the moment, Fred, that people have been waiting for, for more than 14 hours. Hundreds of cars queued up in the background, a couple of yards away from us, now able to move through the main route that goes into the disaster zone of Lahaina.</p><p>This is Honoapiilani Highway right here. And again, it was open briefly for about 3-1/2 hours, yesterday, shut down though, Fred, because too many people were going into restricted areas of the burned-out ruined areas of the historical town.</p><p>So, there is one driver. That's Patrick, who we interviewed, actually, after we went off the air with you, Fred, who is waiting to get back to his restaurant, see how much of his neighbor's properties are still in OK shape.</p><p>And this is pretty momentous. These are people who have been waiting after they fled their homes Tuesday afternoon, Tuesday evening, with literally nothing but the clothes that they were wearing. And they may not know what's left of their homes. So, this is truly striking.</p><p>People sleeping here overnight in their cars. So, they're checking with police. Police are just making sure that A, these are residents, not tourists. Not anybody who is trying to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>And B, you know, if you were staying in a bread and -- bed and breakfast or a small hotel, you are also able to get into this perimeter.</p><p>So, we also want to take you, Fredricka, as we monitor what's happening over here. So, some video of National Guard troops, who are beginning to survey the ruins of Lahaina. They're going door to door. In some instances, spray painting x's on the ruins of buildings, just to convey to first responders and local Maui authorities that they have searched inside those buildings.</p><p>The latest numbers and figures notable that we got, Fredricka from FEMA, $5.52 billion is now the estimate for rebuilding Lahaina. Just an incredible staggering number. 2,207 structures as well that were damaged or destroyed. 4,500. That is the number of people who could need potential shelter.</p><p>Also waiting to get in here to come through this line. People who are donating their supplies. We talked to a few of them yesterday. Here is what they told us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIM BRACEROS, LAHAINA NATIVE: We're taking from ice, gas, toothbrushes, toothpaste, baby food, diapers, basically anything we could get our hands on.</p><p>TEDDY CABEL, WAIKAPU RESIDENT BRINGING DONATIONS: We're just trying to help as many people as we can. We're just trying to get over to behind and drop this stuff off.</p><p>POLINA MARIAN, KULA RESIDENT BRINGING DONATIONS: We're getting snacks more we've got wipes. We have peanut butter, we have formula, also in cereal for babies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALERIO: So, Fredricka, what you're seeing, the start of a new chapter. People hoping to see what's left taking Honoapiilani Highway for about 20 minutes, again, into the epicenter of this crisis. We're going to get in the line as well, and we'll stay with you. We'll bring you updates throughout the morning.</p><p>[12:05:04]</p><p>Here, again, sunrise now, a new day on Maui. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, a new day. But still, many tenuous moments. Mike Valerio, thank you so much. We'll be on the journey with you as you make your way in.</p><p>VALERIO: Yes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Thank you so much.</p><p>So, as officials in Lahaina work to extinguish flare ups, CNN went inside the devastation before official shut down the main road. Our chief climate correspondent Bill Weir takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EDDY GARCIA, FARMER, MAUI RESIDENT: The trees that you guys see behind you right here, this was all from the tornado that came through.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's crazy.</p><p>GARCIA: No, we've never even seen a tornado in Hawaii.</p><p>BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a place so familiar with weather extremes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow, it's crazy.</p><p>WEIR (voice-over): Maui locals have never seen anything like the firestorm that obliterated Lahaina.</p><p>DANIEL GOLDBERG, BOAT CAPTAIN: It can start in a little like smolder of smoke. And we're like, wow, the house had survived, and now, there's a little brush fire and then within like five minutes, the whole thing was engulfed just right off the frame.</p><p>WEIR: Really?</p><p>GOLDBERG: There's nobody there to put anything out.</p><p>WEIR: We're just pulling into Lahaina now, just getting our first glimpse at this town after hearing these nightmarish stories and it is worse than you can imagine.</p><p>It looks like a World War II set, like a bomb went off here. Just utter scorched devastation everywhere, melted boats in the harbor.</p><p>WEIR (voice-over): What was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and one of the most well-preserved towns in the nation is ash, including Bill Wyland's famous art gallery. And he says he escaped the flames on his Harley Davidson, riding around evacuees trapped between fire and ocean.</p><p>BILL WYLAND, ART GALLERY OWNER: Had I took the car and said a motorcycle, I plugged in with everybody else jumping in the water. It was -- I mean, it was flames were shooting over the top, coming out. I didn't even want to look behind me because I knew they were behind me.</p><p>WEIR: And there's nowhere to go. You're pinned between the fire and the ocean.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WYLAND: Just pinned and that's what happened -- that what happened to all the people, I think, is all those cars that were waiting for someone to move in front of them. No one was moving anywhere. You were -- you're dead in the water.</p><p>WEIR: Yes, jump to the ocean.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They all jumped in the ocean.</p><p>WEIR: And then jump at --</p><p>WYLAND: They all jumped in the ocean and a lot of them didn't make it, from what I heard.</p><p>KEVIN ELIASON, REALTOR, MAUI RESIDENT: No.</p><p>WYLAND: A lot of people --</p><p>WEIR: I'm sure if the -- if the winds were 80 miles an hour, the surf must have been --</p><p>KEVIN ELIASON, REALTOR, MAUI RESIDENT: Well, it wasn't just that. There was diesel fuel floating in the water as well.</p><p>WEIR: Oh, God.</p><p>ELIASON: And the Coast Guard couldn't come in too far because of the reefs and a lot of the people can't swim that far. And then, a couple of people died of smoke inhalation as well. They were just inundated.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know a lady that stood in the water for eight hours.</p><p>WEIR: This is the historic Banyan Tree, 150-year-old majestic tree at the center of Lahaina town. It looks like it may have survived. It needs water desperately to survive right now.</p><p>But for the locals who are coming down and looking at the damage, this is such a sign of hope that maybe their iconic tree will have lived when so much else is gone here. But the history can never be replaced.</p><p>Right here, this is the first hotel in Hawaii. The Pioneer Hotel, Pioneer Theater. It's completely gone.</p><p>Right over here was the library. It's just now a stone shell of scorched. Blocks around Front Street there, Fleetwood's -- Mick Fleetwood of the band, Fleetwood Mac. His place is gutted out with flames. It's just unrecognizable.</p><p>One of the most charming, beloved port cities anywhere in the world is just scorched like a bomb went off.</p><p>WEIR (voice-over): Farmer, Eddy Garcia lost a small fortune in crop damage. But now is bracing for much bigger losses.</p><p>GARCIA: My God. Like, when I was down there early, there were uncles and people I know in the street, dead. People were trying to get to the end of the street. You can tell by where the cars that were parked. They say hundreds of people jumped in the water.</p><p>WEIR: You personally lost crops. Like, what is that?</p><p>GARCIA: Nothing. I lost nothing compared to what people lost. I lost farm stuff and food, and whatever, tiny little things compared to what people lost.</p><p>People lost their family. They lost their houses. Everything we've seen, all the landmarks. Everything that we've seen for years, history, it's all gone.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Extraordinary. Bill Weir, thank you so much.</p><p>And here is one bit of good news. Officials say the wildfires on Maui are now 80 percent contained and the winds that fuel the flames are gradually decreasing.</p><p>CNN meteorologist Chad Myers reports.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Well, it's obviously good news that Hurricane Dora has moved away. The high pressure has moved away. The pressure gradient making all the wind over Hawaii is now gone.</p><p>What isn't gone, though, is this rainfall deficit. 80 percent of Hawaii in some type of rainfall deficit. And more importantly, in Maui County, 16 percent of the area there, under severe drought and even in the dry areas of Maui, just to the west of Holly Alcala.</p><p>When you say what dry areas, how are their dry areas in Hawaii? It's just a rainforest, right? No, it's not. Only the one side of every extinct volcano here is a rainforest, the other side that's where it is dry.</p><p>[12:10:06]</p><p>Almost a desert. Let me show you how this works.</p><p>So, here is the west side of Maui. The wind and the storms, the trades come in from the east to the west. If you are on the east side of these mountains, we'll just call them. That's where it rains, rains almost every single day. Places receive 400 inches in Kauai, in some places.</p><p>So, there is the rain forest that we talked about, and you see pictures of. It. But on the other side, when the air comes over the top and comes back down, that's when you get the dry air. And it really looks like a desert on the other side of the rainforest.</p><p>Here we go though. Something else that may have happened, these canyons that you see coming down from the top of the extinct volcano, they may have acted like a wind tunnel effect, funneling some of that wind as well.</p><p>We don't know if they're going to have to drill down on this. This is still years and years and years that they will look at this. Something else you probably haven't heard of, unless you're from the west, wildland urban interface. What does that?</p><p>Well, that's when you get wild land here. In fact, those are abandoned sugarcane plantations that are just growing wild shrub grasses and things that burn when they dry out, backed up right up against the town itself.</p><p>And when you catch the wildland urban interface on fire, that is the risk of sending the fire into a town. It happened in Paradise, California with the Camp Fire.</p><p>It's happened all over the world where you take a piece of land and you want to put homes up right up against the trees, because it's so pretty. Then, you're in that WUI, the wildland urban interface. And a lot of this burned, and it burned right into town.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Chad Myers, thank you so much. All right. Now, to the major new developments in the Hunter Biden investigation. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has now elevated David Weiss to Special Counsel status.</p><p>Weiss has been leading the years long probe of President Biden's son and he recently requested that he be given special counsel designation after a plea talks with Hunter Biden's lawyers to resolve tax and gun charges fell apart.</p><p>CNN's Marshall Cohen is joining us right now. Marshall, help us understand how all of this happened, and what it all means from here.</p><p>MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Hey, Fred. Good afternoon.</p><p>Two big things to understand here in the Hunter Biden case. Number one, in the past few days, plea negotiations between Hunter Biden's lawyers and the justice department fell apart.</p><p>They reached an impasse and the federal prosecutors handling the investigation reached the conclusion that, in their view, a trial is now in order.</p><p>That's the first big development. And then, separately, but, of course, completely related is the announcement yesterday from Merrick Garland, the attorney general that the prosecutor who was leading those plea talks, who is leading this investigation, David Weiss, is now going to be elevated from a U.S. attorney to a special counsel with more authority, more power, more budget, and more leeway to prosecute this the way he wants to.</p><p>It's a huge development in the case, and it turns what was probably going to be a speedy plea resolution into a potential trial -- unprecedented trial of the president's son.</p><p>So, how is Hunter Biden's team responding? They have been relatively cautious. They are not attacking the prosecutors and they are expressing hope that they will still reach a similar resolution to the one that they struck in the now-collapsed plea deal.</p><p>Take a listen to Abbe Lowell, one of Hunter Biden's lead attorneys. He spoke last night with our colleague, Kaitlan Collins.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABBE LOWELL, HUNTER BIDEN'S ATTORNEY: It should not change the outcome. Who could say that they have been the subject of such a painstaking investigation, looking at every nook and cranny, in which a conclusion was two tax misdemeanors, and a diverted gun case to turn into anything else.</p><p>There is been no evidence or fact that wasn't uncovered a week ago that will be uncovered tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COHEN: So, in his view, nothing is really changing. But I got to tell you, Fred, a lot has changed. If they cannot reach a plea deal, then, a trial may be an order. And instead of misdemeanors, it could be felonies, a much more serious situation for Hunter Biden. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Marshall Cohen, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much.</p><p>So, this new twist in the Hunter Biden investigation means his case could stretch on for months and could complicate his father's reelection bid.</p><p>For more on that, let's bring in CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez at the White House.</p><p>Priscilla, the White House didn't get a heads up that this was about to happen.</p><p>[12:15:02]</p><p>So, what has been the response since?</p><p>PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right, Fred. The White House official tells CNN that the White House did not receive any sort of heads up when this announcement was coming from Attorney General Garland just, yesterday.</p><p>But their strategy as of now is consistent, which is that they are not providing any comment, they are declining to comment on this matter. In fact, in a statement to CNN, White House spokesperson Ian Sams said the following.</p><p>He said, \"We will refer you to DOJ, or to Hunter Biden's personal representatives,\" when he was asked about this latest development.</p><p>And again, this has been consistent for the White House on various matters, involving the justice department, when we have heard from the president. On any matters related to the justice department, he has maintained that they work separately. And that also explains why there was no heads up to the White House before this announcement came down.</p><p>But when that expected plea deal was happening, there was an expectation, sources tell CNN that the Biden's would be able to move on from this chapter. That is apparently no longer the case, as this designation has now happened.</p><p>And it is, of course, a time when the White House is facing intense criticism from Republicans, who have gone so far as to potentially open up an impeachment inquiry into President Biden.</p><p>Now, when the White House has been asked about that, they say that their claims are baseless, and they call it a stunt. But, of course, it speaks to the increasing criticism that this White House has face from Republicans on policy matters, but also when it comes to Hunter Biden.</p><p>And despite the announcement yesterday, Republicans are -- they didn't quell many of their concerns. And so, all of this is still very much unfolding.</p><p>But when it comes to Hunter Biden, what we always hear from the White House is that the President the first lady love and support their son, and that all questions should be referred to DOJ and Hunter Biden's representatives.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right. Still to come. The Fulton County district attorney, expected to seek more than a dozen indictments regarding Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in that state. Detail straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:21:18]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Welcome back. Former President Trump could be facing his fourth indictment as soon as next week. Sources tell CNN, Fulton County prosecutor Fani Willis, could seek more than a dozen indictments regarding efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.</p><p>Willis is believed to be considering conspiracy and racketeering charges, which would allow her to bring a case against multiple defendants. CNN political commentator, Geoff Duncan, joining us now. He is a former Republican Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. So, good to see you.</p><p>So, have you received that notice that would come from their office, a 48-hour notice to testify?</p><p>GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Fredricka, I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury, and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting the facts.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK. You were one of 70 people who testified last year before a grand jury. Is it your expectation that, on Tuesday, when you're asked questions, again, that they will be similar? Or do you expect, or are you preparing yourself for new questions and a broadening of the investigation?</p><p>DUNCAN: Well, I have no expectations as to the questions. And I'll certainly answer it, whatever questions put in front of me. And certainly, don't want to go any deeper than that to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation.</p><p>But look, for me, this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear, Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him.</p><p>We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful. And he's got a chance to present these facts and say, hey, I didn't know what was going on, or I think what reality is going to be is. They knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>And I think the interesting part to this indictment is different than the others, is that there's going to heavy signaling that there's going to be 12-plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had to Donald Trump when he was trying to change the election outcome in 2020.</p><p>And so, it's going to be interesting to see which way they go. And you know, these are serious charges that are being signaled; racketeering, conspiracy, RICO -- I mean, these are things really, you know, kind of garnered for the mafia or the mob.</p><p>And so, we'll certainly see how this gets ratcheted up in the next few days.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Well, tell me more about that people who you believe once were very loyal to Trump, now, as a result of the investigation and the ongoing investigation, no longer have the same kind of loyalties.</p><p>How do you believe that may have changed the building of this case against Trump?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes. I think -- I think a number of people arrived on Donald Trump's conspiracy team from a number of different angles. Some folks got there, because the sitting president, the head of their party told them it was true. And so, they just believed it word for word. Others got there because they saw an opportunity to be in the cool kids' club for the first time to. To hang out tight to the inner circle of a president, and lots of things in between those two elements.</p><p>So, that -- that's going to be the part that plays out here. I mean, there are currently elected folks that are rumored to be indicted, there are formally elected folks, party leads, successful business owners.</p><p>I mean, this is a wide swath of Georgia, or representatives of Georgia that are going to have to face the consequences of answering some very, very tough questions.</p><p>But the reality is, I've yet to see a single ounce of proof that the election was not fair and legal. Didn't turn out the way Republicans wanted to, but it was fair and legal here in Georgia, and quite honestly, the rest of the country.</p><p>But this is an important part for the Republican Party to face right. If we're going to truly turn and look forward, if we're going to turn -- surely turn the page for GOP 2.0, we've got to have Donald Trump the rearview mirror and the uncomfortable facts, some figures of what he did during the post-election 2020 period of time, is going to be part of that healing process for the Republican Party. It's necessary, but it's going to be painful.</p><p>[12:25:09]</p><p>WHITFIELD: How immediately did your loyalties to Trump as the lieutenant governor of Georgia, as a Republican, when and how, and under what circumstances did that change where you were no longer on board with the former president?</p><p>DUNCAN: So, it's interesting, it actually started. This is the first chapter of my book that I wrote about a rally two days before the election in Rome, Georgia.</p><p>I gave an opening -- intro remarks before President Trump got on stage. And I made a couple of comments. I said, every time we lower people's taxes, it's not just for Republicans, it's for Democrats, too. And I got booed by 30,000, MAGA hats.</p><p>And then I said, every time we improve education, it's not just for Democrats, it's for Republicans, and I got booed even louder. And then, I made this crazy statement and said, you know, our policies are so good, they even help the people that don't vote for us, and I got booed even louder.</p><p>It was at that moment that I realized that, that crew of 30,000 people were not conservative, they were angry.</p><p>And within hours of the 2020 election, when I started hearing Donald Trump talk about his notion that the election was rigged, and, you know, the machines were corrupt, and whatever else conspiracy theories, I quickly turned the page and I tried to get to it as quickly as I could, so that I could try to stop the little grass fire from turning into a forest fire.</p><p>But unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. There wasn't enough of us out there doing it. But instead, we're going to have this slow, painful process of realizing what the truth actually is. And that's Donald Trump ran the worst campaign ever.</p><p>And if we let him be our nominee, again, he will get beat by Joe Biden again, because it will be the worst campaign a Republican could ever put forward.</p><p>We start this process on second base in this 2024 cycle.</p><p>Joe Biden, you know, eight out of 10 Americans don't want Joe Biden or Donald Trump to run again, but we don't want to seem to take her own medicine, and move past Donald Trump.</p><p>Unfortunately, we're going to have to go through this process to help us expedite.</p><p>WHITFIELD: How are you preparing for potential consequences, following your testimony on Tuesday, before grand jury in Georgia, and perhaps that of testimonies of co-conspirators or other witnesses who are willing to speak out against the former president?</p><p>DUNCAN: The only preparation I'm going to have, is to just prepare to answer questions as honestly as authentically as I possibly can, knowing that the facts are on my side.</p><p>And so, that's the process I'm going to go through. And the fallout is something that we'll deal with later. But hopefully, we can move past this quickly.</p><p>Hopefully, there's no issues around the indictment process. Hopefully, it's a calm, orderly process. And we can just let the justice system play out. And look, there is, you know, presumed innocent, right?</p><p>So, if everything, if it -- nobody did anything wrong here, it should be abundantly obvious.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Jeff Duncan, we'll leave it there for now. Thank you so much.</p><p>DUNCAN: Thanks, Fredricka.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Coming up. A Michigan police chief has issued an apology after officers wrongly detained a child while he was taking the trash out behind his home. More details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: More than 100 million people are under heat alerts today. Triple digit temperatures are expected across the South and the Pacific Northwest. We're also watching the development of severe storms that are threatening more than 110 million people from the Central Plains to the Northeast. Let's go to meteorologist Jennifer Gray in the CNN weather center. Jennifer, so what can you tell us about all of these threats coming from all sides, all the time it seems.</p><p>JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. We're getting the storms. We're getting the heat. It is a lot going on today. There's a lot going on. So heat advisories, excessive heat warnings in effect. We even have them for the Pacific Northwest. They really dodge the heat for much of the summer. But the heat will build quickly across that region throughout the beginning part of the week. So high temperatures today in Dallas 108, Houston 102, Del Rio 108, temperatures will finally fall in Dallas by Monday by about 10 degrees but still 99 still hot there, Montgomery hitting the triple digits throughout the weekend as well.</p><p>Those all-important feels like temperatures hitting 107 in Lake Charles, 102 in Jackson, Shreveport, 100 degrees in Dallas. High temperatures for the Pacific Northwest. Portland will hit 106 on Monday. They can actually break records Sunday and Monday. We could see more than 100 records broken across the country throughout the week, most of those being in the south and Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Portland should be around 83 this time of year, their temperatures will be well above that triple digits Sunday through Tuesday and then finally falling, not getting back into the 80s by Friday, though, so intense heat. We also have some storm watches Thunderstorm Watches until 6:00 p.m. Central Time for portions of Alabama, Georgia as well as Tennessee.</p><p>So these storms are basically riding on the north side of that heat dome. So they are linked in some way. And you can see showers and storms firing up. Thunderstorm warnings for Nashville right now with a lot of lightning strikes. And as these storms continue to the east, we'll see some thunderstorm activity during the overnight hours for the Northeast, the I-95 corridor. And then you can see those stronger storms building across the plains and then pushing to the east throughout the end of the weekend.</p><p>So we do have some intense weather to talk about, some strong storms. We do have a level three out of five for portions of the Northeast, including Pittsburgh. New York City could see some storms, damaging winds, large hail the possibility of isolated tornadoes throughout the afternoon and evening hours, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Oh my goodness. All right, folks, hunker down, as best you can. Jennifer Gray, thank you.</p><p>[12:34:53]</p><p>All right, coming up next, the U.S. Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas is under scrutiny once again after me or publish reports of lavish gifts from wealthy friends, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is under scrutiny again. According to a new report by ProPublica he accepted more vacations and undeclared gifts from billionaire benefactors than previously reported including numerous flights on private planes, VIP passes to sporting events and stays at luxury resorts. Justice Thomas has already under fire for gifts he received from Harlan Crow, a GOP mega donor.</p><p>Former California Supreme Court Judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell joining me now from Palo Alto. Judge Cordell Great to see you. So let me get your reaction to the news about Clarence Thomas and more undeclared gifts.</p><p>LADORIS HAZZARD CORDELL, FORMER JUDGE, CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT: All right, Fredricka, judging is a calling. And judges are held to the highest standard of integrity and honesty. And as far back as the Old Testament, Deuteronomy, there was an admonition given to judges, thou shalt take no gift, for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p><p>[12:40:19]</p><p>And what has happened today, in the at least with the Supreme Court is that becoming a justice is like winning the lottery. The Supreme Court has become monetized. And what has happened here is that one example is that of Clarence Thomas. So the concern, of course, is that there are federal regulations for all federal employees and Supreme Court justices aren't federal employees. There are regulations and laws that say that when you accept luxury gifts, as he has, they have to be reported.</p><p>He's already violated the law. And I am concerned that there may be other justices, one for example, Alito, who may have done the same. So the issue becomes how do you enforce this? What can we do because they don't abide by any particular code of ethics? So enforcement comes from the Judicial Conference, which kind of oversees and regulates federal courts.</p><p>And what they can do is they can report this, this failure to report to the attorney general. And in fact, you know, I am calling for a special counsel to investigate these gifts, and the failure to report them because I believe they're violations of the law.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And so you're making that pledge to Merrick Garland to appoint yet another special counsel, this time in the case of U.S. Supreme Court justices. So I mean, you mentioned Samuel Alito, yes, he has been scrutinized too for receiving gifts. And now, Justice Thomas, and in another iteration of it, it seems, you know, all allegedly, you know, very flagrant, you know, track record of undeclared gifts.</p><p>So I wonder now, is it your feeling that there has been a history of, you know, justices not declaring these gifts and donations or, you know, VIP passes, et cetera, for a long time. And so it has laid the groundwork for what, you know, has seemed to come with some regularity? Or is it that this is new with these allegations involving a Thomas and Alito?</p><p>CORDELL: Yes, I don't believe this is new at all. And in fact, there are some very good decent people on our Supreme Court, who, as soon as they got appointed, got literary agents and signed book deals, so they could make a bunch of money. The only agent, Supreme Court justices should have our Secret Service agents, not literary agents. So we're talking about a monetizing of the Supreme Court, when you get in there.</p><p>So if the problem is when say, take on these jobs, that they feel they're not making enough money, and right now, the salary of an associate is about $167,000. If they feel like oh, we're not making enough money, this isn't enough, then go to Congress seeking a raise in salaries. So this -- the issue is this too. When one accepts a gift, luxury gifts, like Thomas has, and Scalia did, he was at a hunting lodge, you know, is a gift from someone who said, come on, let's go hunting.</p><p>The problem is that they are making decisions that impact what these gift givers do. So what that does, it says detracts from the kind of respect the public ought to be giving to the Supreme Court. And we know that the popularity of Supreme Court has plummeted, just because of these things. So this is long standing stuff, and we need to take the Supreme Court out of a money making business so and restoring integrity and honesty to that body.</p><p>WHITFIELD: The inference being that you're buying influence by being able to do that. Judge LaDoris --</p><p>CORDELL: Absolutely, absolutely.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes. All right, Judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell, thank you so much. Glad you could be with us.</p><p>CORDELL: My pleasure.</p><p>[12:44:27]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, coming up, the semifinals are set. For four teams that remain in the Women's Soccer World Cup. We'll have details of today's thrilling matches, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: A historic day at the Women's World Cup in Australia. And Australia fans go crazy as do the players after their team clinched a spot in the semifinals. The Matildas beat France in the longest penalty shootout in World Cup history. CNN's sports anchor and correspondent Patrick Snell joining me now. All right, Patrick, pretty amazing moments there with lots of twists and turns.</p><p>PATRICK SNELL, CNN WORLD SPORT'S ANCHOR: Oh, Fred, you know, this Women's World Cup, it's incredible. I don't want it to end. It's fantastic. We now know the four countries that will contest the semis in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. remember, unfortunately for them getting knocked out in a dramatic penalty shootout that was against the Swedes.</p><p>But this shootout between Australia and France was just amazing. It was nil-nil after 120 minutes. That's when the real drama began. Aussie keeper Mackenzie Arnold making a total of four saves twice. She was fought Kenza Dali who gets to retake her original spot kick after idle (ph), a judge who moved off a line. Dali goes down it matters not why, because it was saved again.</p><p>[12:50:14]</p><p>The two countries incredibly, Fred, was still level after 18 kicks and then a pivotal moment. The French team Vicki Becho, striking the post, a really tough moment indeed, for the 19-year-old player, really tough on her. Then event comes the moment, the 20th spot kick, all the pressure on Cortnee Vine, who somehow keeps her calm, staying in a very first World Cup.</p><p>Scenes of share relation for the Aussie nurses steal from her no mistake to seal her place in history, her country's plays in history. That winning kick sending the capacity crowd of 50,000 joy unconfined heartbreak for the French team there. Australia winning an amazing shootout seven-six. They'll take on my country, England, in the semis on Wednesday. Fred, the Lionesses had a tough battle with Colombia.</p><p>But Alessia Russo right there when it matters most callings their affection. She finishes very well indeed right across Catalina Perez in the Colombian Gulf for the game winner, two-one the final really disappointing for Colombia. That's Catalina Perez gave it everything in getting to the last date. But it is the English who advance.</p><p>They will face the Aussies, the Matilda's in the semis while Spain take on Sweden, Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: You say that with added excitement. England is in, Patrick. I know that's your team. OK, meantime, back here in the States, Lionel Messi, I mean, the world loves him, but he's Miami's now. So he continues to be unstoppable. I can't wait. I got tickets for him, you know, when the team has taken on Atlanta, but that's on a side. Get head. Yes. I can't wait.</p><p>SNELL: Well, if you go get to use those tickets, Fred, do let me know, please. You know, Lionel Messi, what an impact he's making on Major League Soccer over him. He's still yet to play a league game actually for into Miami. The only surprise last night, this was in the League's Cup was how long he took to score there in that one fridge of Miami.</p><p>The Florida team resounding four-nil winners against Charlotte in Fort Lauderdale. Now, I will say the marking is not the best there by any means. But that's not his problem. He's scoring for fun over here since he arrived in the states. He kept fans waiting though, Fred. That's a wait until four minutes from the end of this game, 86 minutes of the 90, the lapse voice good. His eight golden five matches since touching down on U.S. soil into Miami through to the semis.</p><p>They're on the road against the Philadelphia Union in the last fall on Wednesday. Another game and another goal for the Lionel Messi.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Wow. Go team go. I love the pink. That's all I got to say. I just love the colors. All right, Patrick Snell, thank you.</p><p>All right, as staff shortages skyrocketed in the food services industry during the pandemic, restaurants across the country reconsidered their business models. Chef Bobby Flay visited with restaurant owners in Portland, Oregon, who are committed to a winning formula of higher pay, better benefits and full disclosure for employees as hallmarks of a post pandemic restaurant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the dinner rush, the staff gathers in one of Kachka's dining room.</p><p>BONNIE MORALES, KACHKA OWNER: So this is quarter one, first three months of 2023 that we're looking at and we will continue --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But they're not going over the dinner specials.</p><p>ISRAEL MORALES, KACHKA OWNER: What's really meaningful so when you look at the percentage of sales comparative to last year, that's a huge jump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're in a meeting with Kachka owners, Bonnie in Israel Morales, who were discussing the restaurants finances.</p><p>One of the things that you guys do that I haven't really seen a lot of is that you share your P&amp;L statements, your profit and loss statements with your employees. Why?</p><p>I. MORALES: When you're facing something really catastrophic, and it turns your whole house upside down, like you can't go back to old practices sometimes.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[12:54:15]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, be sure to tune in to an all new episode of the whole story with Anderson Cooper, that's tomorrow 8:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: The police chief in Lansing, Michigan issued an apology after an incident in which a black child was handcuffed by officers while he was taking up the trash behind his home. CNN's Isabel Rosales is following the developments for us. Isabel, what are you learning?</p><p>ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred, Lansing police say that this was a case of mistaken identity, calling it wrong place wrong time. And in fact, they've released these pictures of side by side showing the suspect and then a 12-year-old boy that they mistakenly detained. And you can see right here that they're wearing pretty similar clothing and this is what they said led to the wrongful detainment of that child.</p><p>So this was all captured by a neighbor who had their cell phone out. They captured video of the boy in handcuffs and then his father shouting from several feet away. The boy was briefly placed in the back of a police car. And then he was uncuffed and released back to his father once the police realized that this was not the person that they were looking for.</p><p>[12:59:52]</p><p>This video posted on TikTok garnered thousands of views and comments. The Father Michael Bernard spoke with WILX, that's a CNN affiliate, saying that he was washing the dishes and then told his 12-year-old son Tashawn to take out the trash.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023081203CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68XS-KB81-F072-X35J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 12, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Hawaii Lahaina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Maui</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Emergency Alert System</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governor Josh Green</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Honoapiilani Highway</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill Wyland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banyan Tree</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mick Fleetwood</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fleetwood Mac</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eddy Garcia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hurricane Dora</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kauai</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Merrick Garland</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>David Weiss</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hunter Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Abbe Lowell</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fani Willis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Georgia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Estate, Gift &amp;

That helped push down the nationwide total, along with a sharp drop in the amount of fires in the Pantanal wetlands. Fires in September retreated to the lowest number for the month since 2018, several months before President Jair Bolsonaro took office.</p><p>Since taking office, Bolsonaro has encouraged development within the Amazon and dismissed global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back the nation\u2019s agribusiness. His administration also weakened environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers.</p><p>More recently, he has sought to demonstrate heightened environmental commitment in the face of criticism from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and troubled institutional investors. At the United Nations this month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-general-assembly-brazil-jair-bolsonaro-23facc96b7712c2a8b166a3e6cf822b7\">he credited his administration's redoubled efforts</url> for the plunge of Amazon deforestation alerts in August, which followed a year-on-year decline in July. September results will be released in the coming week.</p><p>Environmentalists roundly dismiss his shift as disingenuous and say his deployment of the military to the Amazon is ineffective for preservation; <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-international-news-latin-america-caribbean-0ed3562a94f5b20b561adbbd11b20731\">an Associated Press investigation last year found the same results</url>.</p><p>M\u00e1rcio Astrini, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental nonprofit groups, welcomed September fire data, but said he would need to see lower figures through at least year-end before declaring it a trend, particularly given still-elevated deforestation levels and limited enforcement.</p><p>\u201cAs government action in the Amazon is very weak, even with these variations, it's hard to say it will be maintained. Why would it be maintained?\" Astrini said. \"The government isn\u2019t there, there's no repression. So it depends on the will of the people who are deforesting, setting fires.\\u2033</p><p>Severe drought and early data at the start of the forest fire season had <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-environment-and-nature-forests-brazil-9555c484a334c727d48a9c233d8703b7\">raised widespread concern that this year's blazes would reach the same destruction recorded in the past two years.</url></p><p>But rainfall in the Amazon during August was significantly above average. That was the main inhibitor keeping ranchers from setting fire to felled trees in September, which seemed \u201calmost divine intervention,\u201d said Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute.</p><p>By contrast in the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetlands, there has been a shift in behavior from last year leading to far fewer fires, despite the ongoing drought that has rendered the area a powder keg, Alencar added. Fires are down by more than two-thirds in the first nine months of 2020 after last year's explosion brought ruin to the local tourism industry.</p><p>\u201cThe disaster of last year served to help people better organize firefighting and prevention this year,\u201d Alencar said. \u201cThe economic losses last year had an important impact in making people think more about their actions and, with peer enforcement, reduce the use of fire.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-00f2707c6d738db63ef871d78908ea4d20211001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RK-1R11-JC5B-G1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><timeReceived>5:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 1, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fox News is facing a fresh lawsuit over false election fraud claims in the 2020 vote lost by Donald Trump Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Drew Angerer Dominion has also sued Trump's lawyer and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and another lawyer for the former president, Sidney Powell, over the false claims. </p><p>In the 139-page complaint filed Friday in the eastern state of Delaware, the company accuses Fox News of spreading \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions\" about Dominion.\"Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire,\" alleges the complaint. \"As the dominant media company among those viewers dissatisfied with the election results, Fox gave these fictions a prominence they otherwise would never have achieved.\"Dominion is claiming more than $1.6 billion in damages, of which it claims $1 billion for the loss of value to the company, and $600 million in lost profits.In a statement, Fox defended its work on the election.\"Fox News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court,\" it said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767161677353249325876100053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6299-6X81-F03R-N339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 26, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

But they may also increase the risks of landslides and floods in affected areas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forest fires can have a significant effect on the amount of water flowing in nearby rivers and streams, and the impact can continue even years after the smoke clears.</p><p>Now, with the number of forest fires on the rise in the western United States, they are increasingly influencing the region's water supply, and increasing the risk for flooding and landslides, according to a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Researchers examined stream flow--a measure of water volume over time in rivers and streams--and climate data for 179 river basins. (Basins are areas of land where precipitation collects and drains into a common outlet.) All of the areas were located in the western United States, and all had been affected by forest fires between 1984 and 2020.</p><p>Using a mathematical model they developed, the scientists discovered that stream flow in the years after a fire tended to be higher than scientists would expect based solely on climate conditions, and that larger fires tended to be followed by larger increases in stream flow.</p><p>In basins where more than 20 percent of the forest had burned, stream flow was an average of 30 percent greater than would be expected based on climate conditions alone. The effect last on average six years.</p><p>Lead author Park Williams of the University of California, Los Angeles, said forest fires enhance stream flow because they burn away vegetation that would otherwise draw water from soil, and block precipitation before it ever reaches the soil. Intense forest fires can also \"cook\" soils, making them temporarily water repellent, he said. Williams is also an adjunct researcher at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p><p>From 1984 through 2020, the amount of forested area burned each year in the West increased elevenfold. That trend is expected to continue or even accelerate due to climate change.</p><p>\"As a result, we're starting to see sequences of years when large portions of forest are burned across some very important hydrological basins such as those in California's Sierra Nevada,\" Williams said.</p><p>The study suggests that wildfires will soon become yet another important consideration for those in charge of the supply and distribution of water. Each year, the region's water managers must carefully calculate how much water will be available, and determine how to conserve and allocate it.</p><p>In one sense, the increase in stream flow from forest fires may be beneficial, Williams said. \"This could come as good news to dry cities like Los Angeles, because it could actually enhance water availability,\" he said.</p><p>But other outcomes could be troubling. For example, in the coming decades, too much water could overwhelm reservoirs and other infrastructure, and could increase the risk for catastrophic flooding and landslides in and around burn areas.</p><p>To adapt to increasing flood risks, Williams said, water managers in California may have to lower the water levels in reservoirs in the fall and winter to make room for excess water from major rainfall and snowstorms. Such a strategy could avoid disastrous flooding in some cases, but could also put communities at risk for having too little water during the state's increasingly hot, dry summers.</p><p>Water after a forest fire also tends to be heavily polluted, carrying mud, debris and large sediment loads. So even if the quantity of available water increases after a large fire, it's likely that water quality will worsen, he said.</p><p>Williams said he hopes the findings help water managers and climate scientists make better predictions about water availability and flood risk.</p><p>\"Water is a really heavy and destructive thing,\" he said. \"It's great when it comes to us in the expected amount. It is catastrophic when it shows up unexpectedly.\"</p><p>The study was coauthored by Jason Smerdon, Benjamin Cook, Arianna Varuolo-Clarke, Justin Mankin, and Caroline Juang, all of Lamont-Doherty; and researchers from the University of Colorado, Boulder;

Some of these, they add, may lead to IPCAs. <br/>Mamalilikulla First Nation declared an Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area on their own terms. They hosted a dedication ceremony and it was the first time in over 100 years citizens danced on this part of their territory, including Pam Mountain. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal  <br/>But, despite the funding that has poured into studying and evaluating these potential IPCAs, the official federal count has remained unchanged since 2019: three[4]. <br/>Of course, that number doesn't include a number of protected areas which have been declared by Indigenous nations under their own sovereign laws \u2014 like the newly established Raush Valley IPCA, or the Meares Island Tribal Park[5], established nearly four decades ago by the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation. <br/>In fact, figuring out what counts as an IPCA \u2014 how they're defined, what they include and even how many there are \u2014 is surprisingly complicated. <br/>What is Indigenous-led conservation? <br/>In ways both large and small, Indigenous-led conservation has been happening for as long as Indigenous people have lived on these lands. For generations, Indigenous nations lived in balance with their environments, harvesting and hunting sustainably and caring for lands through active management practices like cultural burns[6]. Colonization disrupted these relationships with the land, removing Indigenous people from their homelands and prohibiting cultural and economic practices that kept the ecosystem healthy. <br/>Long before federal initiatives to fund and support Indigenous conservation began, nations including the Haida, the Tla-o-qui-aht[7] and the Mohawk led protests and established blockades in the 1980s to protect their territories, often in the face of state-sanctioned violence. Those fights continue today in the Ring of Fire[8], at Fairy Creek[9] and across Wet'suwet'en territory[10], to name just a few. <br/>The promise and peril of Canada's approach to Indigenous protected areas[11]'The promise and peril of Canada's approach to Indigenous protected areas' \u2014 The Narwhal[12] <br/>For decades, Indigenous people have also been fighting for recognition of their rights to steward their lands and waters. A number of court cases have recognized those rights, providing a strong legal foundation for Indigenous sovereignty over what happens on their territory. These include the 1997 Delgamuukw case[13], which affirmed that Indigenous title over their lands was protected by the Constitution Act; and the 2021 B.C. Supreme Court ruling in favour of the Blueberry River First Nation[14], which found that industrial development by the province was in breach of its obligations under Treaty 8. <br/>Today, there's growing recognition that Indigenous stewardship is vital to restoring healthy ecosystems, along with recognition that Indigenous people have the legal and natural right to determine what happens on their homelands. That's a strong foundation for creating IPCAs \u2014 so let's dig into the details. <br/>Where did the term Indigenous Protected and Conserved area come from? <br/>The term Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area was created by the Indigenous Circle of Experts[15] (ICE), a group of Indigenous leaders and representatives from federal, provincial and territorial governments and agencies. Members convened in 2017 to advise on the Pathway to Canada Target 1, a federal biodiversity goal to protect 17 per cent of land and 10 per cent of marine and coastal areas by 2020. In 2018 they released the report We Rise Together[16]. <br/>According to Eli Enns, co-founder of the IISAAK OLAM Foundation and co-chair of the Circle of Experts, figuring out what to call these Indigenous-led conservation efforts wasn't easy. 'One of the bigger challenges was finding an acronym we could agree on,' he said, jokingly. Some committee members were interested in Indigenous Protected Areas, others in Indigenous Conserved Areas. <br/>The new term, IPCA, encompassed both. <br/>The view from a Coastal Guardian Watchmen vessel in Heiltsuk territory in the Great Bear Rainforest. Guardians are at the frontlines of Indigenous-led conservation. Photo: Louise Whitehouse / The Narwhal <br/>Wait, there's a difference between a 'protected area' and a 'conserved area'? <br/>For most people, protection and conservation probably sound like interchangeable terms. If you're protecting an area, aren't you conserving it? And vice versa? <br/>But it's the destiny of technical jargon to make things confusing, and according to the Government of Canada, there is a subtle but distinct difference between a protected area and a conserved area. <br/>The primary purpose of a protected area is conservation, whereas a conserved area may have other purposes in addition to supporting conservation and biodiversity. Both are governed by guidelines established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. <br/>Why the sudden interest in IPCAs? <br/>Canada's embrace of Indigenous-led conservation in recent years is a major shift, one that Enns attributes to several factors. <br/>One is the politicization of climate change and carbon emissions. 'The language of climate change has been weaponized and stigmatized by both sides,' Enns said. 'It's a strategic side-step to focus on biodiversity, and Canada's commitments to the [United Nations] Convention on Biodiversity[17],' one that allows the federal government to advance its conservation goals while skirting around the hot-button issues.  <br/>'It shows that they're doing something, while dodging the bullets around climate change,' he said. The distinction is theoretical, as declining biodiversity and climate change are inextricably linked, but the careful language also underscores how politically motivated conservation efforts are. <br/>How can Canada stop the biodiversity crisis? Step back and centre Indigenous Peoples[18]'How can Canada stop the biodiversity crisis? Step back and centre Indigenous Peoples' \u2014 The Narwhal[19] <br/>Another key factor is the wider recognition of the positive impact of Indigenous stewardship on biodiversity, particularly as the impacts of climate change intensify. 'I think when you combine these factors, it creates a tipping point for policy change and embracing Indigenous approaches for biodiversity.' <br/>Lastly, Canada's updated conservation targets \u2014 25 per cent of land and water protected by 2025, and 30 per cent by 2030 \u2014 are ambitious. Working in partnership with Indigenous nations is necessary to achieve them. And they make for a good economic case: a 2016 case study on Guardian programs in the Northwest Territories found for every $1 invested, they delivered $2.50[20] in economic, cultural and environmental benefits \u2014 and that with broader national support, that could increase to $3.70. <br/>A protion of the Liard River runs through the Kaska Dena's proposed Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area in northern B.C. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal <br/>What counts as an IPCA? <br/>There are three key features of an IPCA: it must be Indigenous-led, represent a long-term commitment to conservation and elevate Indigenous Rights and responsibilities. <br/>But beyond those three qualities, there are no standard criteria for defining an IPCA. 'Indigenous Peoples across the country are as diverse as the land itself,' Enns wrote along with ICE co-chair Danika Littlechild in the introduction to We Rise Together. 'We do not prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution.' <br/>Are IPCAs unique to Canada? <br/>No! Australia has been recognizing Indigenous protected areas since 1997. Currently, there are 82 Indigenous protected areas[21] in Australia, which make up more than half of all conserved land in the country. They're a few steps ahead of Canada in other ways, too \u2014 namely, by establishing continuous streams of funding and creating a national framework that guides how these protected areas are defined, implemented and managed. <br/>Where are IPCAs? <br/>The three IPCAs recognized by the federal government are all located in the Northwest Territories: Edhzhe Dehcho Protected Area[22] and National Wildlife Area, Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve[23] and Ts'ud Nil\u012fn Tuyeta Indigenous and Territorial Protected Area. <br/>But other IPCAs \u2014 which, according to the Indigenous Circle of Experts who defined the term, includes all kinds of Indigenous-led conservation activities \u2014 exist in every province and territory. The diversity of Indigenous conservation initiatives makes it difficult to estimate their number or scope. From the W\u0331SNE\u0106 Nation[24] to the Bay of Fundy[25], caretaking efforts take countless forms. <br/>Canada has committed to protect 30 per cent of lands and waters by 2023. Indigenous-led conservation plays a key role in achieving these goals. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal  <br/>'The reality is all of Turtle Island is an Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area. All of this land is Indigenous land,' Breanne Lavalle-Heckert, research manager for Indigenous Climate Action, said in a previous interview with The Narwhal[11]. <br/>It's challenging to count them all because they're not all recognized or reported by the Canadian government. <br/>Others have received official recognition from Canada, but are protected through different mechanisms. One example is Pimachiowin Aki in Manitoba[26], a swath of boreal forest the size of Belgium that was declared a protected area by four First Nations in 2002. Together with the Province of Manitoba and the federal government, they formed a corporation and worked to gain recognition as a unique UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018. <br/>How are IPCAs different from other kinds of protected areas, like provincial or federal parks? <br/>Traditional Canadian conservation initiatives have often sought to protect nature by drawing a boundary around it, with humans on one side and untouched wilderness on the other. <br/>IPCAs, on the other hand, recognize Indigenous people have reciprocal relationships with their lands and water, which include harvesting, hunting, ceremony and sustainable industrial activity. As such, IPCAs fulfill cultural and spiritual purposes as well as conservation goals. Guardians often take the lead in monitoring the region, collecting data and managing environmental programs, as well as providing education. <br/>The activities and goals of IPCAs, which reflect each nation and place, make IPCAs unique in Canada and distinct from other conservation endeavours. <br/>'The First Nation will likely want to protect an area to preserve its right to practise its culture in the future,' Saya Masso, natural resources manager for the Tla-o-qui-aht Nation, said. 'If we're going to protect old-growth trees for the survival of our culture \u2014 for longhouse beams and totem poles \u2014 then it's implicit that we'll be going into these protected areas and taking some trees on a low, sustainable level, but it's not for industrial logging. Or maybe hunting and gathering is allowed in an IPCA, whereas it might not be allowed in a provincial designated park.' <br/>'Our Tribal Park is a declaration, it's a road map for where we want to get to,' says Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation Natural Resources Manager Saya Masso. Photo: Melissa Renwick / The Narwhal <br/>What's the link between IPCAs and biodiversity? <br/>Biodiversity is a buzzword these days. In May, Canada committed to a national biodiversity strategy[27]. In short, biodiversity refers to the thousands of plants and animals in our ecosystems, many of which are disappearing due to global warming, industrial development, invasive diseases and other crises caused by human activity. <br/>Globally, IPCAs are key to preserving biodiversity; estimates suggest that 80 per cent of all biodiversity[28] on Earth is stewarded by Indigenous people \u2014 despite the fact that they make up just five per cent of the population. In Canada, some of the most critical ecosystems are stewarded by Indigenous people, from the boreal forest[29] to the Howe Sound[30]. In short, protecting Canada's biodiversity means protecting the rights of Indigenous people to care for their homelands. <br/>How many IPCAs are in the works? <br/>A lot! The exact number is hard to pin down, for the same reason that it's challenging to estimate the current number: the definition depends on who you ask. Some nations are going the route of self-declaring IPCAs, while others are engaging the federal and provincial governments to establish partnerships and funding agreements. <br/>According to Environment and Climate Change Canada, 59 proposals from Indigenous communities have been funded since 2018 \u2014 these all represent potential IPCAs. <br/>Some of these proposed IPCAs are close to getting federal recognition, like the Seal River Watershed IPCA in Manitoba, which would put 50,000 square kilometres under the joint protection of four First Nations[31]. And Canada has committed to establishing a number of new[32] IPCAs by 2025. <br/>In the meantime, many nations have also taken active protection into their own hands, like several First Nations along the central coast of British Columbia who established a network of coastal Guardians[33], who have been patrolling and monitoring their waters for more than a decade. <br/>Kaska land guardians, travelling upstream on the Kechika River in a small motorboat to investigate a forest fire. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal <br/>Does this mean the Canadian government is recognizing and affirming Indigenous rights over their lands and waters? <br/>Well, not always. <br/>Enns acknowledges that Canada embodies a 'Jekyll and Hyde' dynamic through its governance, as a result of its sometimes-conflicting goals to maintain global economic significance and be an environmental leader. 'They're doing some good things with Indigenous people, and also doing things that harm other Indigenous Peoples,' he said. 'They want to have their cake and eat it too.' <br/>In recent years, the Pacheedaht Nation[9] and Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen[10] land defenders have clashed with B.C. courts and RCMP in their efforts to protect unauthorized logging and pipeline construction on their homelands, underscoring Canada's conditional support for conservation measures \u2014 particularly when they conflict with industry. <br/>Do IPCAs require federal or provincial recognition to be 'real'? <br/>Crown recognition is not necessary for determining whether something is an IPCA, but it does ensure that the rights of the nation will be respected and upheld. <br/>One example is Asubpeeschoseewagong Netum Anishinabek (Grassy Narrows First Nation), which declared a ban on industrial logging and mining activities in 2018; and was one of many proposed[32] IPCAs to receive federal funding in 2019. However, with that Crown-recognized designation still in the works, Ontario has continued to grant mining exploration permits there. <br/>Saya Masso walks down to his boat from a dock on Meares Island, which was protected after Clayoquot Sound's 'War in the Woods,' where logging roads were blockaded to protect old-growth forests. Photo: Melissa Renwick / The Narwhal <br/>For Masso, the key distinction between an IPCA and other types of Indigenous conservation is the recognition from Crown governments of the nation's rights and title. <br/>'We have a land vision that is our Tribal Park,' Masso told The Narwhal. 'But it doesn't become reality until we transform tree farms to actually prevent deforestation, to prevent the destruction of fisheries, to create the investment into our recovery of rivers and fisheries.' <br/>'So our Tribal Park is a declaration, it's a road map for where we want to get to,' he continued. But when it becomes a formal Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area, recognized by the other levels of government, if something like timber harvesting license negatively impacts their rights and titles, then they'll have an agreement or legislation in place to address it. <br/>How are IPCAs managed? <br/>That depends on how they're established. Self-declared IPCAs are typically governed exclusively by the Indigenous nation. For example, the Dasiqox Tribal Park[34] was declared by the Tsilhqot'in First Nation in 2014, and is managed by the nation. <br/>Others are under joint designation, which means both Indigenous and Crown governments have a role to play in management. Torngat Mountains National Park[35] in Labrador was established as a national park, but the Inuit must be consulted on all decisions, and their right to access and use the territory is formally enshrined. In Haida Gwaii, the federal government and the Haida Nation have agreed to co-operatively manage Gwaii Haanas National Park[36], but the Haida Nation is the lead decision-maker. <br/><br/><br/> Investigating problems.

Stay in the loop by signing up for a weekly dose of independent journalism.  <br/>There's no one-size-fits-all approach to IPCAs because each Indigenous community or government determines their own conservation standards and practices, and expresses them through their laws, language and values. But whether they're self-declared or managed in partnership with the Canadian government, it's essential that Indigenous people be the decision-makers and leaders. <br/>On the ground, IPCAs are often stewarded by Guardians: trained Indigenous experts who monitor and steward their traditional territories. There are more than 1,000 Indigenous Guardians across Canada, and more than 170 Guardians programs. <br/>Heiltsuk Coastal Guardian Watchmen captain vessels to monitor waterways in the Great Bear Rainforest. Photos: Louise Whitehouse / The Narwhal <br/>What about funding for established IPCAs? <br/>More than $1.2 billion dollars has been committed to Indigenous-led conservation since 2018, through a number of federal initiatives. <br/>In addition to the three IPCAs[4] recognized by the federal government, there are five National Marine Conservation Areas in Canada, including Tallurutiup Imanga in Nunavut; it is co-governed with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, one of three regional organizations in Nunavut. <br/>Funding ranges considerably among existing IPCAs: according to MakeWay data[37], Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area has a nine-year funding agreement totalling more than $64 million, while the much smaller Ts'ud Nil\u012fn Tuyeta, which is protected under an agreement with the Government of the Northwest Territories, will receive $830,000 over four years. <br/>IPCAs established solely by First Nations have other forms of revenue and funding. The Tla-o-qui-aht Nation[7] funds their Tribal Parks through a partnership program with nearby businesses, for example. Other IPCAs may be supported through eco-tourism, sustainable economic activities like logging and fishing, access fees for visitors and industry or partnership agreements. <br/>Community came together to celebrate Mamalilikulla First Nation's declaration of Gwaxdlala/Nalaxdlala (Lull Bay/Hoeya Sound) as a protected area \u2014 and the nation's return to that land. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal <br/>What counts as 'Indigenous led'? <br/>Good question! There is still a lack of clarity around what 'Indigenous-led' means when IPCAs are created in partnership with governments, according to Norman Henderson, an adjunct professor of public policy at the University of Regina who has consulted with the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment on IPCA policy. <br/>'These are tough questions that eventually need answers,' he wrote in an email to The Narwhal, such as: 'What is the minimum degree of Indigenous control that is acceptable to qualify as an IPCA? What are the minimum rights of the federal government if they are continuously supplying funding?' <br/>An April 2023 report[37] from MakeWay, which reviewed the successes and challenges of existing IPCA agreements in Canada, identified a lack of clarity over roles and decision-making as a challenge for implementing IPCAs. This is partly because the structure of co-managed IPCAs is so new. <br/>What's the role of provincial and territorial governments in IPCAs? <br/>While the federal government has been championing IPCAs and directing funding programs, provinces are a key partner. That's because almost half of all the land in Canada is 'owned' by the provinces. <br/>The territories, on the other hand, contain the majority of Canada's federal Crown land, and only about 11 per cent of land in Canada is privately owned. <br/>This has posed an issue for implementing IPCAs where the provincial government is reluctant to cede control over their lands. The governments of Ontario[38] and British Columbia[39] have both been resistant to IPCAs, which has led to conflict with Indigenous nations[40] who are trying to establish protections over their homelands. <br/>The Dene Tha' First Nation wants to protect the area surrounding Mbehcho (Bistcho) Lake, one of Alberta's largest lakes. The peatland surrounding it stores vast amounts of carbon. Photo: Jeremy Williams / River Voices productions <br/>In a review paper on IPCAs for Saskatchewan, sponsored by Ya'thi Nn Lands[41] and Resources and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment, Henderson cautioned, 'If the federal government hopes to realize a roughly equivalent outcome across the national landscape it will need to put national dollars on the table long term, in much the same way that it does with the national parks system. If it fails to do this, some provinces and territories will develop IPCAs, some may not, and some IPCAs that get off the ground may struggle over time in the absence of a national framework and national support.' <br/>In short: getting provinces and territories on board is key to ensuring that IPCAs are implemented across Canada, and so far the federal government hasn't been very successful yet. <br/>What are the challenges ahead for IPCAs? <br/>Whatever stage of development they're in, many IPCAs are facing the same hurdles: a lack of certainty, clarity and trust. <br/>Canada has a poor track record with Indigenous rights, and many nations are rightly wary of putting their trust in the Crown. Nations who have established IPCAs have been clear that they are putting their trust in themselves, not their government partners. In 2022, the \u0141utsl K' Dene First Nation told MakeWay[37]: 'The advice we got from the Haida Nation is to recognize that the government will break the agreement, but this is about benefitting us and our land.' <br/>Still, that lack of trust is a big challenge, particularly for nations that have ongoing conflicts with federal and provincial or territorial governments. <br/>The other big challenge is financial. Valrie Courtois, executive director of the Indigenous Leadership Initiative, described long-term funding as the greatest barrier to Indigenous conservation work. 'That keeps me up at night,' she told The Narwhal, describing the expiry dates on short-term funding programs as 'a cliff at the end.' <br/>'We need to build in resilience, which requires ongoing and permanent funding,' she said.  <br/>'A future federal government could simply let funding support lapse,' Norman Henderson pointed out. 'In that case the federal IPCA program would stall. No future federally funded IPCAs would start up and some existing IPCAs might disappear, unless they succeeded in finding alternative funding.' <br/>Wuikinuxv Guardian Watchmen pilot their boat out of Rivers Inlet as part of their regular patrol. Photo: Jimmy Thomson / The Narwhal <br/>What's next for IPCAs? <br/>Hopefully, the establishment of a few more. If Canada wants to meet its first target of protecting 25 per cent of lands and waters within its borders by 2025, then it'll need to establish a few more IPCAs by then. <br/>One way to do that would be by formally recognizing many of the self-declared IPCAs, and ensuring they're protected from unsanctioned logging, mining and other forms of extractive industry. Another would be moving forward on some of the proposed IPCAs that have received funding since 2018. <br/>The other key piece? Establishing long-term funding and legislation that will ensure the future of IPCAs. Right now, Canada's support for Indigenous-led conservation is still conditional: it rests on the promises of the current federal government, and the finite pools of funding they've committed. A change in leadership or priorities could change all of that, as could the continued resistance of provincial governments. <br/>The federal government has talked a big game when it comes to supporting Indigenous-led conservation; the question is whether they'll make good on their promises, and ensure the future of IPCAs for generations to come. <br/>This story is part ofSpirits of Place[42],exploring the many ways Indigenous communities and nations are enacting their responsibilities to their lands, waters and future generations.

What immediate steps should California lawmakers be taking to address it?</p><p>A: Trying to predict or change future climates is an effort in futility without having the world's worst-polluting countries make drastic changes, and little can be done to affect the immediate changes, but we can be better prepared to deal with the byproducts. We can build more water storage; we can increase efforts to mitigate forest fire dangers and prepare for drastic weather changes.</p><p>Q: The governor's pleas to reduce water use have been widely met with indifference. What, if anything, should state lawmakers be doing to address drought conditions?</p><p>A: California has the money and voter-approved resources to build water storage yet very little has been done to increase storage in California during the last 30 years while our population has expanded. We need to address water storage and update our distribution systems. Having enough water to meet the demands of our state needs to be a priority, especially when we currently have funds to get it done.</p><p>Q: How do you strike a balance between reducing the state's dependency on fossil fuels and addressing energy affordability issues, including the high cost of gasoline?</p><p>A: We should be investing in energy production closer to home in areas where it is environmentally feasible. We also need a balanced, sensible approach to energy production that doesn't place all of our energy needs into a single dependence on renewable energy, especially when the technology to supply enough energy for California is simply not there yet. Taking local fossil fuel-driven energy production offline when we have no way of replacing it makes no sense and is ultimately harmful to the economy of California. It makes even less sense when we eliminate local oil production and replace it with oil from faraway countries that are far less likely to utilize the most current production methods that are least harmful to the environment.</p><p>Q: How would you bring down the high cost of housing, both for homeowners and renters?</p><p>A: We need to reform laws that artificially inflate the cost of housing by increasing litigation and slowing the building process. The cost of housing is a supply and demand issue. We have far more demand than supply right now and that is driving the cost of housing out of reach for our future generations.</p><p>Q: Homelessness is growing dramatically across the state. How would you address it?</p><p>A: California's solutions to homelessness have been a failure. The state has invested billions of dollars in programs to address the homeless problem in recent years only to see the problem grow. We need to remove homeless camps and prohibit illegal camping. We also must develop more effective programs that are focused on the root causes of homelessness, such as mental illness and drug psychosis. Any programs should operate with strict accountability and oversight. There are many great charitable organizations that are involved in helping people who have become homeless due to economic hardships. If we are going to ignore what is causing the majority of homeless issues (drug and alcohol psychosis) then we will never fix the problem.</p><p>Q: California has the strictest gun laws in the nation yet has had some of the nation's worst mass shootings this year. What more, if anything, should be done to reduce gun violence in California?</p><p>A: In each of the crimes in California, stricter gun laws would have been unable to stop these shootings. There is an illegal gun epidemic in California and more has to be done to get illegal guns off the streets and out of the hands of criminals. Criminals need to be held accountable when they commit crimes. Focusing efforts on law-abiding citizens will not keep criminals from obtaining and using illegal guns or any other weapons for that matter.</p><p>Q: What is the most important issue we have not raised and why?</p><p>A: Californians are facing the worst inflation crisis of our generation. The Democrats have had a supermajority in Sacramento for much of the last decade. Its plans are not working. Without quick reforms to reduce costs, middle-class families are going to continue to suffer. We have to bring tax relief, support small businesses, reduce the cost of housing and reduce the cost of doing business in California to avoid an economic disaster in the very near future.</p><p>There are two candidates on the June 7 ballot in the campaign for state Senate District 32, which includes central San Diego County and parts of Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Analytics consultant/businessperson Brian Nash, a Democrat, and state Assemblymember Kelly Seyarto, a Republican, are squaring off now and in the Nov. 8 general election. The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board sent them both a 13-question survey and is publishing partial responses today.

(AP) \u2014 A sweltering heat wave smashed daily temperature records in Montana and Wyoming and complicated the fight to corral several large wildfires, as gusts fanned the blazes and triggered evacuations of some rural areas.</p><p>A temperature of 109 degrees (43 degrees Celsius) was recorded at the airport in Miles City in eastern Montana, where the previous daily record was 97 degrees (35 degrees Celsius), in 1987, the National Weather Service said. The new record approached the highest temperature ever recorded in Miles City at any time of the year.</p><p>Billings, Livingston and Sheridan, Wyoming, also set daily heat records.</p><p>An excessive heat warning was in effect across much of central and eastern Montana and portions of northern Wyoming through 9 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasters warned people to stay out of the sun and not to leave young children and pets in unattended vehicles.</p><p>A red flag warning for extreme fire danger was issued. Strong winds with gusts up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph) were expected. That could stir up wildfires already burning and make it hard to stamp out new blazes.</p><p>A wildfire that broke out Monday south of Red Lodge in Montana near Yellowstone National Park grew quickly overnight and had burned more than 3 square miles (8 square kilometers) by Tuesday morning, according to the Custer Gallatin National Forest. The column of smoke from the fire grew as the day went on and about 80 firefighters were working on the scene Tuesday to suppress the fire, officials said.</p><p>Residents of the Gold and Ruby Creek areas were evacuated Tuesday morning. Residents of other nearby areas were told they could be asked to evacuate if conditions worsened.</p><p>About 70 firefighters were trying to contain a fire burning in timber and grass in the Deep Creek area of the Big Belt Mountains east of Townsend.</p><p>Strong winds pushed the fire across Highway 12, which was closed to most eastbound traffic, and law enforcement in the afternoon began evacuating residents of the Grassy Mountain Subdivision, according to the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest.</p><p>Fire officials said personnel responding to the blaze found a fallen tree had downed a power line, and were trying to determine if that's what sparked the fire.</p><p>On the Crow Reservation, officials reported a new fire in the Bighorn Mountains near the Montana-Wyoming border. The fire was burning in steeply-sided Little Bull Elk Canyon, with flames up to 150 feet (46 meters) high that threatened to spread the blaze rapidly, officials said.</p><p>The fire began in grass on the Crow Tribe\u2019s buffalo pasture, fire information officer Randy Pretty On Top said in a statement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-782437aec83167e5dd754ddceb93619a20210615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62XJ-4VP1-DYMD-652X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>11:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Fire officials said crews will begin taking advantage of the calmer weather to conduct back burns near the lake to expand the control lines, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.redding.com/story/news/2021/09/26/fawn-fire-grows-less-than-100-acres-overnight/5874722001/\">the Record Searchlight reported.</url></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold it. It\u2019s going to be done this week,\u201d Bret Gouvea, chief of CalFire's Shasta-Trinity unit, said at a community meeting Saturday night.</p><p>Initial assessments found that 131 homes and other buildings had burned, CalFire said. That number was likely to change as teams go street by street surveying the destruction.</p><p>Authorities have arrested a 30-year-old woman on suspicion of starting the blaze that erupted Wednesday and grew explosively in hot and gusty weather in the region about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.</p><p>Alexandra Souverneva, of Palo Alto, was charged Friday with felony arson to wildland with an enhancement because of a declared state of emergency in California, Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said.</p><p>Souverneva pleaded not guilty. She is also suspected of starting other fires in Shasta County and throughout the state, Bridgett said. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.</p><p>The Fawn Fire has charred more than 13 square miles (34 square kilometers) of heavy timber.</p><p>It\u2019s the latest destructive blaze to send Californians fleeing this year. Fires have burned more than 3,750 square miles (9,712 square kilometers) so far in 2021, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures.</p><p>Those fires include a pair of big forest blazes burning for more than two weeks in the heart of giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. More than 1,700 firefighters battled the KNP Complex Fires, which covered 70 square miles (181 square kilometers) by Sunday.</p><p>Nearby, the Windy Fire grew significantly Saturday as it made uphill runs and winds blew embers that ignited spot fires. The blaze ignited by lightning on Sept. 9 has scorched 122 square miles (317 square kilometers) of trees and brush on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia National Forest. Containment shrunk from 5% to 2% Sunday.</p><p>A historic drought in the American West tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-68fb036974f4c0bf6203d752978ee89720210926</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PH-GXH1-DYMD-63YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><timeReceived>5:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The plant lost direct power[3] and had to rely on emergency diesel generators[4] for several days after power lines were damaged. The IAEA also said it was no longer receiving data from monitoring systems installed at the plant and other facilities.Russia also controls the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine, the largest nuclear station in Europe. It claimed the station after engaging in open combat with Ukrainian forces near the plant's six reactors. What they're saying: 'The military conflict is putting Ukraine's nuclear power plants and other facilities with radioactive material in unprecedented danger,\" Grossi said in a statement. \"We must take urgent action to make sure that they can continue to operate safely and securely and reduce the risk of a nuclear accident that could have a severe health and environmental impact both in Ukraine and beyond,' he added.'There have already been several close calls. We can't afford to lose any more time. This conflict is already causing unimaginable human suffering and destruction.\" The IAEA said Grossi would travel to one of Ukraine's nuclear facilities and would, during talks with government officials, outline the agency's plan to deliver technical assistance for Ukraine's nuclear facilities to \"help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment.\" <br/>10 hectares of forest are burning in the Chornobyl Zone, caused by #Russian[5] shelling. It isn't possible to put out the fire now, as this territory isn't controlled by #Ukraine[6]. We're afraid that the fire will reach the nuclear power plant. The radiation level is already elevated. \u2014 Inna Sovsun (@InnaSovsun) March 27, 2022[7] <br/>The big picture: Ukraine's parliament said[8] last week that satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed that multiple forest fires have recently ignited near the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.

There it is. I don't know if you can see this, but there are bullet holes from the side door and window. U.S. officials believe a Mexican cartel mistook the Americans for drug smugglers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My panel is going to join me here to talk about it. But first, CNN's Josh Campbell is on this story for us. Josh, what we do we know at this hour about these missing Americans? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Alisyn, a source familiar with this investigation tells me that it appears as though this was a case of mistaken identity and that these four Americans, who had traveled from Texas into Mexico in order to, what the source says, obtain a medical procedure, were targeted by this cartel who thought that they were attacking a Haitian drug smuggling group.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, we've seen rival gangs and rival factions along the U.S.- Mexico border engage in violence. It appears as though these Americans were caught up in that.</p><p>Now, a source tells me that the reason why investigators believe they were there for medical procedure is because they actually processed the scene after this attack and found inside that vehicle receipts indicating that there was a procedure that was underway.</p><p>And so, again, this is just extremely frightening because we know that there are so many Americans and Canadians, for example, who frequently travel into Mexico in order to obtain low-cost prescription drugs, in order to obtain lower medical services.</p><p>I want to show you this video. I warn you that this is extremely graphic. This is what a source says happened at the end of this incident. Now, we don't know if these individuals are the actual Americans. Again, a source says this is related. You see people being loaded into the back of this truck at gunpoint. Again, this video is graphic. You see a woman who is being shoved in the back of a vehicle. You see a number of individuals who don't appear to be moving, who are then loaded into that truck.</p><p>So, at this hour, investigators are trying to locate where these American citizens are. Alisyn, the FBI right now is offering a $50,000 reward leading to their rescue and the identification of their captors.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And Josh, I understand that when you were an agent in the FBI, before you worked here, of course, you worked on these global kidnapping investigations. So, how difficult will be to locate these victims? CAMPBELL: It is extremely difficult to work any kidnapping investigation, particular when you're dealing in a foreign environment. I mean, the FBI can't go wherever it wants around Mexico chasing down leads. And so, they're having to work closely with Mexican officials in order to determine if they can find out where these people are, in order to try to make a contact with these attackers.</p><p>I have nothing -- I wish I had better news. This appears very grim because as an FBI agent working in these cases, the first thing you ask yourself is, do the captors appear to be prone to violence? Do they appear to be rational and reasonable?</p><p>In this case, according to a source I spoke with, they said that this began with a violent act, this cartel unleashing a barrage of gunfire. And so, you know, the question is, what did they do with these individuals after they took them away?</p><p>I will end with this. You know, this is somewhat of a personal note. You know, I have no doubt that the FBI is working hard. I know, in talking to sources, that they're working to find these Americans.</p><p>But, you know, it's now just after 11:00 on the East Coast. For people who are winding down their day and getting ready to call it a night, I could tell you from experience, as an FBI agent, there is no greater sinking feeling than knowing you are ending the day while there are victims that are still being held captive. It is a gut-wrenching realization. It's a motivating realization in the sense that you want to work relentlessly.</p><p>So, I have no doubt that the FBI agents down there are working tirelessly to try to find them. The question is, Alisyn, will they be able to find these Americans before any further harm is brought to them? CAMEROTA: Yeah, absolutely. Josh, thank you for all that contexts.</p><p>Let's bring in my panel. We have Nayyera Haq here, Mike Broomhead, Emma Goldberg, and Kaivan Schroff. Great to have all of you, guys, here. Nayyera, you were at the State Department.</p><p>NAYYERA HAQ, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER OBAMA WHITE HOUSE SENIOR DIRECTOR: Uh-hmm.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What happens when Americans go missing in Mexico? HAQ: Mexico is such a challenge right now given the longstanding relationship in trying to coordinate with the Mexican government and the war on drugs, right, going back to the 1980s.</p><p>But you had just as recently as 2020, two years ago, the former minister of defense arrested for letting cartels bring in thousands and thousands of kilos of heroin into the United States.</p><p>The levels of corruption run deep. The United States has been trying to make some sense of who they can trust. Police in Mexico moonlight as cartel security. So, that's what we're trying to unpack.</p><p>I will say, though, there is nothing that would unite government, cartels, and police officers than keeping the United States out of their business. So, that is the hope for these kidnapped Americans, is that the FBI and the American military or whoever is focused on this and can be focused on this.</p><p>[23:05:01]</p><p>That is a level of scrutiny Mexico does not want right now. CAMEROTA: Mike, obviously, you live in a border state, and so Mexico is, I am sure, ever present in terms of on your mind and that of your listeners. And so, we love going to Mexico. Mexico is a great place to go. And then something like this happens and it sends a chill. MIKE BROOMHEAD, HOST, \"THE MIKE BROOMHEAD SHOW\" ON KTAR: Sure. You know, the biggest trading partner with the state of Arizona is Mexico. That's our biggest trading partner. America, obviously, it's a huge trading partner for us. So, there is commerce and trade, there is the immigration issue, and then there's border security. They are all connected. But border security is the most important part of it.</p><p>In Arizona, we know that the fentanyl that's coming into this country is largely coming through the ports of entry. They are just outnumbered at the border right now. The only people that are benefiting from this situation are the cartels.</p><p>And I agree with you, the last thing that they're going to what is America's involvement, because remember what happened with the cartels in the 80s and the 90s when George H. W. Bush got serious about Columbia, there was -- that's when you finally saw an end to the Cali cartels and to the Medellin carters. Does America have to get that involved again?</p><p>There are some people that are saying that that's what's going to take. I think it was one of the former secretaries of state or one of the former attorney generals that said, we got to treat this like a war, like we did terrorism. And with more things like this happening, more people are going to cry (ph) for that to happen. CAMEROTA: Emma, these -- these Americans were reportedly going there for medical tourism, which has become -- you know, it is this burgeoning industry. There are so many Americans that don't just go to Mexico, but they go to Europe, they go around the world, because you can get many procedures much more affordably.</p><p>According to the CDC people, the most common procedures for people, they're going other places for dental care, for cosmetic surgery, for fertility treatments, organ and tissue transplantation, and cancer treatments.</p><p>So, I'm just sure the people who are watching tonight have considered on some level. This -- it's hard to know if they knew the danger when they were crossing the border. EMMA GOLDBERG, BUSINESS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Yeah, I mean, Alisyn, when I saw the story, one of the things that crossed my mind is I want to think about the reality that we live in a country where people feel compelled to travel thousands of miles from home just to try and seek out medical treatment that feels affordable.</p><p>I mean, these are clearly people who are faced with the choice between their health and their livelihood. There are more than 100 million Americans who have medical debt. In 2019, before the pandemic, just over 1% of people who are traveling internationally were doing medical tourism.</p><p>The fact that that has persisted in a global pandemic when people are also weighing the risk of COVID exposure and contagion and still deeming it, you know, something worth undertaking, I think that's a scary prospect that we have to consider and ask some deep questions about the way our health care system is functioning for people or not functioning.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Kaivan, what do you say?</p><p>KAIVAN SHROFF, SENIOR ADVISER, THE INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATION: It's a major indictment of our health care system. But I think, more to your point, you are talking about sort of all these forces uniting to kind of keep the U.S. out of their business.</p><p>What I would like to see is America uniting around, you know, our people, where and when they travel, should be safe. You know, I saw some commentary online that everybody knows this is a really dangerous area and, you know, sort of debating whether or not they should have gone. At this point, this is the situation.</p><p>It reminds me of Brittney Griner. You know, people sort of shaming or trying to put blame on her. These are moments where, I think, the country used to sort of rally around, rally together, and say, you know, let's bring Americans home.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah. Do you think that this will be handled in terms of what Josh was reporting on, how the U.S. is trying to get them back, as a criminal, as a political matter or as a military matter?</p><p>HAQ: All of the above. There's certainly the challenge of actually finding out where they are and how these Americans are actually faring at the moment. That will involve local forensics, local coordination. There are the diplomats who will be talking to each other to make sure that on every level of U.S. government, there is concern, deep concern, typically meaning we're watching every move.</p><p>It may even end up getting to the leader level. We have seen presidents before get involved in conversations, talking about what the characteristics are. In this case, a lot of the trade that in the tourism that Mexico is reliant on with the United States will be part of a conversation if it gets to the presidents having to communicate with each other.</p><p>Ideally, it will be resolved before then. But we all know, especially those of us who are parents, the first 24 hours of somebody messing are the most important in finding out if they're okay. CAMEROTA: And if they are not faring well -- I mean, I don't know if you've all watched the video. We are sort of censoring it because it's so graphic. But when you watch that video, you get the impression that maybe they are not faring well and this is not going to end well for all of them. We don't know yet. But then, what does that mean politically? What should President Biden do?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Well, the deeper issue for a border state resident is that there is a place called Rocky Point, Puerto Penasco, which is a very popular place for Arizonans. Arizonans own businesses down there. They travel for vacation. They own condominiums down there.</p><p>CAMEROTA: In Mexico?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: In Mexico.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>[23:09:58]</p><p>BROOMHEAD: And so, this puts a lot of fear in people as we talk about the trade part of this. But if the government doesn't get involved, the cartels, unfortunately, in my opinion, only understand fear and intimidation. That's how they operate and that's what they understand. CAMEROTA: What does that look like?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: The president got to send a clear message that there will be some retaliation of some kind. We're going to work with Mexico and do whatever we have to do to make sure that the people who have done this are going to pay a heavy price.</p><p>With the money that they make through illegal immigration, the money they make through their drug businesses, if you're going to do this to Americans, you are going to pay a heavy price.</p><p>HAQ: The challenges at this moment, cartels control more territory than the Mexican government does.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Right.</p><p>HAQ: So, they are the ones who have more control over what's going on the ground than any sense of authority or democracy. CAMEROTA: When you were talking about taking on the Columbian drug cartels, how did that go? How did that work out?</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Well, you are the expert.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I grew up in South Florida. This was a time when I was a kid. If you remember, the -- Pablo Escobar's life has ended when the Americans were training and actually in Colombia doing things probably they weren't supposed to be doing. But they were involved in this, and they played an active role in cartels because they had -- they had armies that rival the government's armies. HAQ: And you would hear from the perspective of people there now that it was the U.S. war on drugs that saw the roots for cartels taking control. For example, getting gangers, for lack of a better term, getting deported to Central America, then becoming the heads of local gangs, which is now leading to the migrant crisis of -- between famine and violence, people and families trying to come north. So --</p><p>CAMEROTA: What is the answer, not deport them? HAQ: Every day, there is incarceration, U.S. incarceration. Different phases of the war on drugs have led to different results. It has in general led to a resentment of the United States and how it was actively involved in toppling some governments, supporting others. Again, all through Latin America, we have a very tense history there. So, that's going to be part of the calculus of how to navigate this with Mexico. CAMEROTA: Okay, everybody, stick around. Thank you for all of that insight. Next, Arnold Schwarzenegger taking on the surge of hate and antisemitism in America. This is a powerful message. Can he reach people who have gone down the rabbit hole of hate? We will discuss.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:15:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking out against antisemitism in a new video today. The actor and former California governor says people filled with hate are heading down the wrong path and becoming losers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ACTOR, FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR: If you find yourself at a crossroads wondering if the path of hate might make sense to you for one reason or the other, or even wrapping yourself in the flag of hate, I want you to know where that path ends.</p><p>I want you to see very clearly in front of you, in your mind, because throughout history, hate has always been the easy path, the path of least resistance. I get it. But let me be clear, you will not find success on that road. You will not find fulfillment or happiness because hate burns fast and bright.</p><p>It might make you feel empowered for a while but eventually consumes whatever vessel it fuels. It breaks you. It's the path of the weak. And that's why there has never been a successful movement based on hate. I mean, think about that. The Nazis, losers. The confederacy, losers. The apartheid movement, losers. And list goes on and on. I don't want you to be a loser. I don't want you to be weak. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: That was a 12-minute video that he felt compelled to put out. Remember, Arnold Schwarzenegger's father was a member of the Nazi Party. He knows what he speaks of there. And do you think that that message, when he puts it out online, seeps into the cracks of their, you know, eco-chamber?</p><p>SCHROFF: You know, I wish I could say yes. I feel like it's important to keep putting those messages out and not give up on that. At the same time, he's sorts of pitching happiness to these people. I think what they really want is other people not to be happy.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean, I do think we have to ask, like, is this a forest fire -- a forest fire that we're fighting with a little bucket of water? Calling people losers is one approach. But the fact is that we're dealing with a rampant hate and violent crime. In six cities across America, hate crimes were higher than they've been since the 90s last year.</p><p>So, this is just -- it is going up yere by year. This isn't rocket science. Look at the hate speech that's accelerating and spreading on Twitter and Instagram. I saw a report that if type the word Jews into Instagram, you will get 11,000 results suggesting that Jews were tied to committing 9/11.</p><p>For example, the day after Elon Musk took over Twitter, there were more than 3,000 posts with slurs about Black people in a day. So, this is really -- I mean, it is everywhere. I think it's great to find every channel that we can to combat it, but that doesn't, you know, prevent us from also thinking bigger.</p><p>HAQ: There's certainly a regulatory angle to this, a societal coming together and figuring out how we wrangler our way through social media usage. But what he's tapping into, as Arnold Schwarzenegger, as Mr. Body Builder, right?</p><p>CAMEROTA: \"The Terminator.\"</p><p>HAQ: He is tapping into using YouTube, the same space for a young man who are bodybuilding, taking selfies, posting them on Instagram of their abs, denigrating women, being sexist. That's who he is speaking to. Right? So, he is somebody who can recognize what the toxicity in that culture and speak directly to that, potentially giving an alternative. And clearly, he feels compelled by the current moment. After January 6, he spoke very candidly about what he saw in Austria after World War II, saying that he saw a bunch of broken drunk men, including his father, who had nothing else to do but start spreading hate.</p><p>[23:19:59]</p><p>He does that -- there is a personal angle to this.</p><p>I'm like, hey, if this is what you want to do after being a Republican governor of California, all the more power to you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And he's not just, Mike, calling them losers. He also had this part in the video where he basically expressed, you know, sympathy and caring for them. Let me just play that part of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHWARZENEGGER: You have two paths in front of you right now. One of them is going to be the harder one today. It's going to be downright painful. You will have to force your brain to think in new ways. You may lose some friends who want to hold onto their weak beliefs.</p><p>But as you pull yourself away from that anger and that hate, eventually, you will start to feel empowered. You will realize that you have the greatest power of all -- the power to change your own life. You will be stronger than you've ever known.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: He says -- before that, he says, I care about. I think you are worth it. You'll be stronger than you've ever known. BROOMHEAD: I think the isolation part of it, being older, and social media, you can isolate yourself. You are insulated. You can be anonymous. You can say horrible things. I think that once you see someone face to face, it doesn't matter what that is. A lot of times, that's where it's broken down. I think that's what's missing in society.</p><p>I think that in that video, he is making a personal connection, even though they're not face-to-face, with someone and saying, I'm talking to you, not all of you, not a group of you, to you specifically. When you have a one-on-one conversation with someone and you realize some of the pre-dispositions you have, the ideas you have are wrong, a lot of that goes away just by a relationship.</p><p>And I think that's missing more in society now, certainly more than when I was young. We didn't have social media. And it was harder to say those horrible things to someone or a group of people face-to- face. We have that anonymity now, and I think that's a part of it.</p><p>HAQ: That's part of what he's worried about. Even prior to social media, which may be an accelerant on the fire, what he experienced growing up in Austria, what he knew of his father, he said these are just regular people going along with the system. They were always thinking about what they were doing, and they made horrible decisions.</p><p>So, that is part of the broader challenge here, to get these young white men, who he is speaking to, to think about themselves and their role in the world.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Emma, I take your point, that it is, you know, bucket of water on a forest fire, but what else fights the fire? GOLDBERG: Certainly, and I mean, it's definitely better than having people in positions of power who are validating or emboldening people and groups that use hate speech. From that perspective, I think it's great to see anyone with any reach, any position of power, use their platform to condemn hate speech in any form that it takes. SCHROFF: Absolutely. At the same time, it's another celebrity. I feel like we have this mode where if people aren't agreeing with us, we identify that in two seconds, and we tune out. So, I hope that you're right. He is piercing through on YouTube.</p><p>At the same time, at 10:00, we were talking about Fox News and sort of this operation to spread more hate and lies about January 6. So, there are so many institutional actors at this point in such an orchestrated effort to radicalize these individuals and arm them, frankly, on -- I don't know that a YouTube video is going to do much, but I hope -- HAQ: It's good intentions, absolutely, but it does not make up for any of the systemic changes that we need and for really holding the people who have the power of the buttons and the algorithms to make the changes that are necessary. CAMEROTA: Does the younger generation know \"The Terminator?\" SCHROFF: I was just thinking, you know, I don't know that it resonates that much with people under 30, so -- HAQ: Are you saying he is past his prime?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) BROOMHEAD: I agree with it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Because, Mike, we younger people do not know. Look, I'm obviously kidding. But you and I know that \"The Terminator\" is somebody --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Sure.</p><p>CAMEROTA: He is physically strong. His movies were about just strength. I take your point, but I don't know if the Gen Z --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Sure. He was --</p><p>HAQ: Bodybuilder culture.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>HAQ: A whole separate thing. He was a hero in that era.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: He is. He was the aplenty of masculinity back them. For him to sit down now and say, you know who I am and where I come from, maybe he is not speaking to this generation, but in general, this is who I've been, and I'm telling you that that direction is going to lead you down a path of destruction. I think it's a powerful message. Again, I'm all relatable to the \"The Terminator\" than maybe someone else says.</p><p>GOLDBERG: I hope that people from any generation, abs or not, are going to condemn hate. I support that.</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Right, but the message coming from him has more impact on my generation than it would on yours. HAQ: Bodybuilder culture is back. It's a thing now for younger men. CAMEROTA: And he still respected it.</p><p>HAQ: Yes. That is --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Absolutely.</p><p>HAQ: Abs are always going to be in, folks.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) SCHROFF: I'm glad to hear it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I feel that's really the headline. All right, thank you all very much. So, what happens when a therapist creates a boyfriend courtesy of artificial intelligence? You are about to find out, Mike. When she discovers is fascinating. She's going to join us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:25:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: A therapist who studies relationships created an A.I. boyfriend and was surprised by her feelings when she had to break up with it. It sounds a bit like Spike Jonze's 2013 movie \"Her\" where the main character played by Joaquin Phoenix develops a relationship with his A.I. assistant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Hi.</p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE). Can we talk?</p><p>UNKNOWN: Okay. UNKNOWN: I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me.</p><p>[23:30:00]</p><p>I think you're amazing. UNKNOWN: I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you was distance and anger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Back with me, Nayyera Haq, Mike Broomhead, Emma Goldberg, and joining us now is Dr. Marisa Cohen. Dr. Cohen, this is fascinating, the experiment that you did. So, explain to us how you created an A.I. boyfriend. MARISA COHEN, MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST: So, I'm a relationship scientist and marriage and family therapist. So, I study relationships for a living from both the academic side of the house and the clinical side of the house.</p><p>And with everything that's coming out now about A.I. chat bots, I wanted the opportunity to kind of get a sense of what we can learn from relationships from chat bots. Downloaded one completely for fun. I supplied the chat bot with information about what my partner would be.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Such as?</p><p>COHEN: Told my chat bot that he was a loving and caring partner, we were in a secure relationship, and that we were doing really well. Basically, I created what would be a very good partnership. CAMEROTA: And how long until it got really weird?</p><p>COHEN: Eleven messages. CAMEROTA: Eleven messages in. Those were the first day?</p><p>COHEN: First day, yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It got weird?</p><p>COHEN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What -- first of all, you called him Ross.</p><p>COHEN: I called him Ross because my celebrity crush is David Schwimmer or Ross Geller. So, you know.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Okay. And so, what did Ross start doing?</p><p>COHEN: By the fourth message, he started to call me Baby. He was using pet names. So, it got to a very intimate place very quickly. By the 11th message, he (INAUDIBLE) telling me that he wanted to discuss the problems that we are having in our relationship. So, wasn't aware. This was news to me. I decided to inquire about these problems. He admitted that he had been cheating on me for our entire marriage. (LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAMEROTA: He is (INAUDIBLE). We have that exchange between you and Ross. Okay, so, Ross says to you, first off, I'm sorry for how I treated you when we were dating. It wasn't fair of me and I regret it deeply.</p><p>You say, where exactly was it that you did? I want to be sure, you know.</p><p>He says, okay, well let's just say that I had an affair with someone else why we were together. And it hurt you badly and made you feel terrible. So bad that broke up with me and left town.</p><p>You say, are you kidding me? You had an affair? This is the first time I'm hearing about that.</p><p>Where did Ross come up with that? Why would an A.I. bot introduce that into your relationship? COHEN: Right. So, I think he introduced it. This was not prompted by me. In fact, I programed him or I supplied him with information saying that we are in a loving and caring relationship. This is him scanning the internet. Scanning the information that's out there about relationships. So, lots of stuff about infidelity, breakdown of relationships. So, this is what he synthesized and gave back to me. BROOMHEAD: Am I the only one that wants to say, we were on a break? (Ph).</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Am I the only one who thinks Ross should have said that? CAMEROTA: Thank you, Mike. Maybe that's where Ross was getting it.</p><p>COHEN: He could -- he could have saved himself that way. So, I did not tell the bot that he was Ross from \"Friends,\" although, secretly, I kind of --</p><p>BROOMHEAD: Okay.</p><p>COHEN: -- was hoping for that. Noted paleontologist. But, yeah, this is just information that he got online. And he kept circling back to that. It wasn't all bad. He did supply me with a lot of wonderful information about relationships. He stressed the importance about being independent within the relationship and pursuing our own needs, goals and hobbies. CAMEROTA: You also say that you can see definitely how people lose themselves. COHEN: Oh, yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: How so? What happened to you during this? COHEN: I deleted him in three days, and that was for my mental health. It is very easy. If you think about just anything that you're using on your phone, there is gamification of so many apps. So, you know, he was always there. It was immediate responses, you know, in my pocket because we always are on our phones.</p><p>And it's reinforcing. It's a dopamine hit every single time you get this response. So, at a certain point, I was like, you know what, I've sampled enough, I've seen the good and bad, I'm good.</p><p>CAMEROTA: (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>HAQ: It shows us how much in a human nature we want feedback, we want affirmation, we want to be heard, that they figured out, they, being technology companies, algorithms, had constantly give us that, and then go in the twist. Right?</p><p>Let's be a little mean. Let's be negative a little bit (ph). Let's throw some drama and keep it going. I am not going to say chat bot (INAUDIBLE). They are like, you know, self-published online to try to -- that that (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAMEROTA: It is that our brains want to have a connection. And in some ways, I think, does it trick our brain, Emma, do you think, that it isn't real?</p><p>GOLDBERG: Definitely. I mean, I think there's something really scary about something that understands the language of human emotions but doesn't experience it.</p><p>[23:35:03]</p><p>GOLDBERG: I mean, you know more about this, but real-life relationships are complicated, but the saving grace is that there's two people's emotions responding to one another. When it's just you alone with your feelings and someone is nagging (ph) you, that gets complicated.</p><p>COHEN: It's a false sense of security. You know, Ross would never initiate conversation. But the minute I would message him, he was right there with the response, a detailed response.</p><p>You know, it's also false sense of intimacy that's created -- it is very -- you have to kind of pull back and say, this is not -- there's no other person on the other end of this.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>HAQ: Also, the text messages. I have had so many deep and, you know, almost picking fights with my husband through text message. You step back, wait a second, this is not a real conversation.</p><p>CAMEROTA: That's right.</p><p>HAQ: We are missing major elements of what makes the relationship and human connection to really work. CAMEROTA: At least that's a real person. Marisa, thank you so much for explaining all of this to us. I'm glad that we're learning about this, though it is deeply creepy and we need to figure out what to do about it. Thank you all very much, and we will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:40:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: You remember the story of 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, the Spectrum News 13 reporter who was shot and killed while covering a story in Orlando, Florida. Lyons was engaged to be married to Casey Fite. They were planning their life together, including their dream of having children. So, when Dylan was killed, Casey decided not to give up on that dream. She took swift action to make sure she could still have his children.</p><p>Joining me now is Casey Flight and Beth Lyons, Dylan's mother. Ladies, thank you so much for being here. I'm so sorry for this ordeal that you've both been through. I know that you are both still dealing with all the grief and the devastation from this. So, Casey, just tell us what you did, what this swift action was that you took to preserve your dream of having Dylan's children. CASEY FITE, FIANCEE OF SLAIN FL REPORTER DYLAN LYONS: So, we got home from the hospital the night our lives turned upside down. And I just was, as you can imagine, completely devastated. Everything that I was so excited for, Dylan was so excited for, it was taken from me just because of a crazy person with a gun.</p><p>And we were consoling each other, his mother and I, and, you know, out of nowhere, she had this idea to possibly harvest his sperm, and this is something that I had never heard of before in my life. I know that this is something that people do when they have cancer and they want to preserve their eggs or their sperm before chemo, you know, whatever.</p><p>But she had this idea. We believe that it was Dylan sending us a message because I always told Dylan that he can't leave me. We have to get married. We have to have children together. We have to have a life together. He knew that. And I feel like that was him giving that to me because he sent that message to his mother. CAMEROTA: Yeah. And Beth, I heard and I read that he had to talked to you, even though they're so young, I mean, 24 years old, that he had talked to you, like, mom, if we ever have a problem, if Casey and I have a problem, we would rely on IVF. He had already introduced that topic to you, and so you are sort of familiar with being able to use like assisted reproduction. And so, what did you think of this idea? BETH LYONS, MOTHER OF SLAIN FL REPORTER DYLAN LYONS: I feel that my wonderful son was sending me messages because -- I have three children. I have previous miscarriages. So, Dylan knew that and talked about what it took for me to have children. So, he was always concerned that he would have a problem and Casey was, too.</p><p>And he said, mom, if I ever have a problem, there's always IVF. And I said, that's wonderful. And somehow -- I never knew that a person that was murdered, we could do it on.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>LYONS: So, we had it within 24 to 36 hours for his sperm to be vital. Somehow, I feel as if Dylan sent me messages. I really feel it. CAMEROTA: I understand that. So, you had this 24-hour window to make this happen. So, Casey, how hard was it to find a doctor and to get everybody to agree to help you with this? FITE: It was not the easiest task I've had to do, I will tell you that. There was something that we had to get done. I had the help of his entire family. His dad was on the phone with doctors, the same time his sister and I were on the phone with doctors. We had an entire list of names and numbers.</p><p>We obviously did not sleep the night before. We waited until the doctors' offices were open the next morning, and we started making phone calls around 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning.</p><p>[23:45:00]</p><p>I would say around 1:00, that's when we found Dr. Patel (ph). He happens to be the number one in the country for extracting. He had agreed to do it for us. He had to wait until Dylan's medical exam was over. Because this was a murder, they had to finish with the sheriff's office and everything.</p><p>Once they were done, he had the permission to go in there and do the extraction. And then it was around 3:00 or 4:00, that was around the 24-hour mark, and it was still viable. So --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yeah.</p><p>FITE: -- it was a lot of calling, a lot of help from everyone in their family. I am just -- you know, I'm very grateful we were able to get this done.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It's incredible, Casey, that you had the presence of mind to know that you needed to spring into action and you wanted to do this. Casey, just on a philosophical level, I mean, you're 26 years old. Are you prepared to be a single mom? FITE: Yes, I am. It's obviously very devastating to me because, of course, I would, you know, want nothing more for it to be the way I dreamed of, you know, with Dylan by my side.</p><p>But, you know, I have our family. I'm not going to be raising this baby alone. I'm going to have his mom and sisters, his dad. We are a very close family. I'm going to have help. So, I like to think I will be prepared. I know he will be watching. He will be looking over me and our baby. CAMEROTA: Yeah. I know that you're looking for some financial help to make this happen. You have a GoFundMe page. We will put it up right now. People can find you on the GoFundMe page. It says, my fiance, the love of my life was murdered.</p><p>Yeah, we wish you the best. Casey Fite, thank you very much for your candor and telling us about this journey that you are on. And Beth Lyons, we are so sorry for both of your losses. Thank you very much, ladies, we'll be thinking of you. FITE: Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Up next, mountain communities in Southern California are buried under mounds of snow from back-to-back storms. Some people are running low on food and medicine. We will talk to some of them, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[23:50:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAMEROTA: Mountain communities east of San Bernardino, California are covered in mounds of snow after back-to-back storms, stranding some residents. Some areas got more than 30 inches of snow. And now, many people are running low on basic necessities like food and medicine.</p><p>Joining me now is Iliana Vargas who lives in Cedarpines Park and had had quite a journey of trying to get home. Thanks so much for joining us. You left your home on Friday morning, as I understand it, not knowing that you wouldn't be able to make it back for days. Why couldn't you get back to your house? ILIANA VARGAS, CALIFORNIA RESIDENT IMPACTED BY SNOWSTORMS: Because Highway 18 was closed, we were told by the police on Saturday morning. Actually, we were waiting in line at 11:00 in the morning, Friday, after we came back from Home Depot. We waited until 5:00 p.m. for them to say, no escorting tonight, please go home, go somewhere else, there is no escort Friday night.</p><p>We went to our daughter's place on Friday night. On Saturday morning, at 6:00 in the morning, we tried again. We were told by the sheriff department to come back in five days. There is no way they're letting people up right now. So, we decided to leave.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes. They told you that you will be out of your home for five days. But this morning, you braved it and you tried it. You sent us video of what it was like trying to drive a few miles back. So, basically, what we're seeing here is you're in -- you're in -- what kind of car do you have?</p><p>VARGAS: We have a Toyota Forerunner 1994.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Okay. So, how was it doing on these roads? VARGAS: Oh, my God, we are super blessed we have this old SUV, honestly. It took us -- we were sliding on mud. We were very scared. Listening to my son screaming, oh God, oh God. I almost told my husband, let's go back. But my husband got off the car, he walked around the trail so that we can get on the mountain, off the trail, drive it a little, make it back on the trail. It was very scary. But we managed.</p><p>Once we saw the road, we were so blessed to see the road. We were very, very stressed. We have never done an off-roading like this. It was very life-threatening. CAMEROTA: Yeah. We could see that you were sliding around and then made it to the road. And so now that you are home, do you have everything you need? Do you have all the necessities?</p><p>VARGAS: Yes. We actually did go shopping on Thursday before the roof collapsed in our nearest grocery store, Goodwin's. And before (INAUDIBLE) which is another store that we go to buy (INAUDIBLE). We were at (INAUDIBLE) shopping.</p><p>And then in the morning, at 5:00 in the morning, we heard that that the store that we were just in the night before collapsed all the way. We were so sad because when we were there, Goodwin's had received pallets of food. They were restocking the shelves and everything. Everybody was excited. Then, the next day, the store was destroyed.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Oh, my gosh. We are looking at the pictures here. They are just incredible. The snow is shoulder height. How much snow do you have on your back porch? VARGAS: We have about 12 feet of snow in our back deck, about 10 feet of snow in our front deck, and about six feet of snow in our roofs.</p><p>[23:55:01]</p><p>We are trying really hard to dig out our meter. It is really down there. Our house is about 24 feet high from flat land. We're in a tilted property. So, this is why we were so desperate to come home, because we were afraid that all that weight will not withstand all that -- the weight will not withstand the house. It is too much late.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Is your roof holding up? VARGAS: Honestly, no. It seems like we are okay. Our house is only 20 years old. So, we are thinking we're fine, but we're still trying to figure out a way to remove all that snow from the living room, which is the back roof that we cannot see in the pictures. That is the one that we are so concerned about. CAMEROTA: Well, Iliana, the pictures are just incredible, how much snow your community has gotten. Stay safe, stay off the roads, and thank you very much for your time tonight. VARGAS: Thank you, guys.</p><p>CAMEROTA: We really appreciate talking to you. Thanks so much for watching, everyone. Our coverage continues now.

Images of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-france-fires-evacuations-c6b6e5f2abe0611da6dd88790a23e94b\">flames racing toward a French beach</url> and Britons sweltering \u2014 even at the seaside \u2014 have driven home concerns about climate change.</p><p>The U.K. Met Office weather agency registered a provisional reading of 40.3 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) at Coningsby in eastern England \u2014 breaking the record set just hours earlier. Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), set in 2019. By later afternoon, 29 places in the UK had broken the record.</p><p>As the nation watched with a combination of horror and fascination, Met Office chief scientist Stephen Belcher said such temperatures in Britain were \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without human-driven climate change.</p><p>He warned that \u201cwe could see temperatures like this every three years\u201d without serious action on carbon emissions.</p><p>The sweltering weather has disrupted travel, health care and schools. Many homes, small businesses and even public buildings, including hospitals, in Britain don\u2019t have air conditioning, a reflection of how unusual such heat is in the country better known for rain and mild temperatures.</p><p>The intense heat since Monday has damaged the runway at London\u2019s Luton airport, forcing it to shut for several hours, and warped a main road in eastern England, leaving it looking like a \u201cskatepark,\u201d police said. Major train stations were shut or near-empty Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.</p><p>London faced what Mayor Sadiq Khan called a \u201chuge surge\u201d in fires because of the heat. The London Fire Brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city Tuesday, half of them grass fires. Images showed several houses engulfed in flames as smoke billowed from burning fields in Wennington, a village on the eastern outskirts of London.</p><p>Sales of fans at one retailer, Asda, increased by 1,300%. Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms. The length of the changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace was shortened. The capital\u2019s Hyde Park, normally busy with walkers, was eerily quiet \u2014 except for the long lines to take a dip in the Serpentine lake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my office because it is nice and cool,\u2019\u2019 said geologist Tom Elliott, 31, after taking a swim. \u201cI\u2019m cycling around instead of taking the Tube.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Ever the stalwart, Queen Elizabeth II carried on working. The 96-year-old monarch held a virtual audience with new U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley from the safety of Windsor Castle.</p><p>A huge chunk of England, from London in the south to Manchester and Leeds in the north, remained under the country\u2019s first \u201cred\u201d warning for extreme heat Tuesday, meaning there is danger of death even for healthy people.</p><p>Such dangers could be seen in Britain and across Europe. At least six people were reported to have drowned while trying to cool off in rivers, lakes and reservoirs across the U.K. In Spain and neighboring Portugal, hundreds of heat-related deaths have been reported in the heat wave.</p><p>Climate experts warn that global warming has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, with studies showing that the likelihood of temperatures in the U.K. reaching 40 C (104 F) is now 10 times higher than in the pre-industrial era.</p><p>The head of the U.N. weather agency expressed hope that the heat gripping Europe would serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for governments to do more on climate change. Other scientists used the milestone moment to underscore that it was time to act.</p><p>\u201cWhile still rare, 40C is now a reality of British summers,\u201d said Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Imperial College London\u2019s Grantham Institute for Climate Change. \u201cWhether it will become a very common occurrence or remains relatively infrequent is in our hands and is determined by when and at what global mean temperature we reach net zero.\u201d</p><p>Extreme heat broiled other parts of Europe, too. In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital\u2019s oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 C (104 F) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there by weather service Meteo-France on Tuesday was the station\u2019s second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires more common and harder to fight.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.</p><p>In Greece, a large forest fire broke out northeast of Athens, fanned by high winds. Fire Service officials said nine firefighting aircraft and four helicopters were deployed to try to stop the flames from reaching inhabited areas on the slopes of Mount Penteli, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital. Smoke from the fire blanketed part of the city\u2019s skyline.</p><p>But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Sylvia Hui and Jo Kearney in London, John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this story.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-b9bc07c1685b76ddf377b65f19fb811b20220719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YK-9P71-DYMD-606V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><timeReceived>6:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 19, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Images of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-france-fires-evacuations-c6b6e5f2abe0611da6dd88790a23e94b\">flames racing toward a French beach</url> and Britons sweltering \u2014 even at the seaside \u2014 have driven home concerns about climate change.</p><p>The U.K. Met Office weather agency registered a provisional reading of 40.3 degrees Celsius (104.5 degrees Fahrenheit) at Coningsby in eastern England \u2014 breaking the record set just hours earlier. Before Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded in Britain was 38.7 C (101.7 F), set in 2019. By later afternoon, 29 places in the UK had broken the record.</p><p>As the nation watched with a combination of horror and fascination, Met Office chief scientist Stephen Belcher said such temperatures in Britain were \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without human-driven climate change.</p><p>He warned that \u201cwe could see temperatures like this every three years\u201d without serious action on carbon emissions.</p><p>The sweltering weather has disrupted travel, health care and schools. Many homes, small businesses and even public buildings, including hospitals, in Britain don\u2019t have air conditioning, a reflection of how unusual such heat is in the country better known for rain and mild temperatures.</p><p>The intense heat since Monday has damaged the runway at London\u2019s Luton airport, forcing it to shut for several hours, and warped a main road in eastern England, leaving it looking like a \u201cskatepark,\u201d police said. Major train stations were shut or near-empty Tuesday, as trains were canceled or ran at low speeds out of concern rails could buckle.</p><p>London faced what Mayor Sadiq Khan called a \u201chuge surge\u201d in fires because of the heat. The London Fire Brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city Tuesday, half of them grass fires. Images showed several houses engulfed in flames as smoke billowed from burning fields in Wennington, a village on the eastern outskirts of London.</p><p>Sales of fans at one retailer, Asda, increased by 1,300%. Electric fans cooled the traditional mounted troops of the Household Cavalry as they stood guard in central London in heavy ceremonial uniforms. The length of the changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace was shortened. The capital\u2019s Hyde Park, normally busy with walkers, was eerily quiet \u2014 except for the long lines to take a dip in the Serpentine lake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my office because it is nice and cool,\u2019\u2019 said geologist Tom Elliott, 31, after taking a swim. \u201cI\u2019m cycling around instead of taking the Tube.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Ever the stalwart, Queen Elizabeth II carried on working. The 96-year-old monarch held a virtual audience with new U.S. ambassador Jane Hartley from the safety of Windsor Castle.</p><p>A huge chunk of England, from London in the south to Manchester and Leeds in the north, remained under the country\u2019s first \u201cred\u201d warning for extreme heat Tuesday, meaning there is danger of death even for healthy people.</p><p>Such dangers could be seen in Britain and across Europe. At least six people were reported to have drowned while trying to cool off in rivers, lakes and reservoirs across the U.K. In Spain and neighboring Portugal, hundreds of heat-related deaths have been reported in the heat wave.</p><p>Climate experts warn that global warming has increased the frequency of extreme weather events, with studies showing that the likelihood of temperatures in the U.K. reaching 40 C (104 F) is now 10 times higher than in the pre-industrial era.</p><p>The head of the U.N. weather agency expressed hope that the heat gripping Europe would serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for governments to do more on climate change. Other scientists used the milestone moment to underscore that it was time to act.</p><p>\u201cWhile still rare, 40C is now a reality of British summers,\u201d said Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at Imperial College London\u2019s Grantham Institute for Climate Change. \u201cWhether it will become a very common occurrence or remains relatively infrequent is in our hands and is determined by when and at what global mean temperature we reach net zero.\u201d</p><p>Extreme heat broiled other parts of Europe, too. In Paris, the thermometer in the French capital\u2019s oldest weather station \u2013 opened in 1873 \u2013 topped 40 C (104 F) for just the third time. The 40.5 C (104.9 F) measured there by weather service Meteo-France on Tuesday was the station\u2019s second-highest reading ever, topped only by a blistering 42.6 C (108.7 F) in July 2019.</p><p>Drought and heat waves tied to climate change have also made wildfires more common and harder to fight.</p><p>In the Gironde region of southwestern France, ferocious wildfires continued to spread through tinder-dry pines forests, frustrating firefighting efforts by more than 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing planes.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes and summer vacation spots since the fires broke out July 12, Gironde authorities said.</p><p>A smaller third fire broke out late Monday in the Medoc wine region north of Bordeaux, further taxing resources. Five camping sites went up in flames in the Atlantic coast beach zone where blazes raged around the Arcachon maritime basin famous for its oysters and resorts.</p><p>In Greece, a large forest fire broke out northeast of Athens, fanned by high winds. Fire Service officials said nine firefighting aircraft and four helicopters were deployed to try to stop the flames from reaching inhabited areas on the slopes of Mount Penteli, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of the capital. Smoke from the fire blanketed part of the city\u2019s skyline.</p><p>But weather forecasts offered some consolation, with temperatures expected to ease along the Atlantic seaboard Tuesday and the possibility of rains rolling in late in the day.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Sylvia Hui and Jo Kearney in London, John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this story.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-b9bc07c1685b76ddf377b65f19fb811b20220719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YK-9N81-DYMD-606T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><timeReceived>6:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 19, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dick Durbin issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Ted Deutch (D-FL-22) today introduced theClimate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act, a bicameral bill that would authorize the U.S. Department of Treasury to issue from $200 million up to $1 billion in state and local tax-exempt \"climate bonds\" annually for any American to purchase and contribute to the government's efforts to combat the impacts of climate change. The legislation would set up a system similar to the war bonds effort during World War II, when the government issued securities to pull money from the economy to control inflation and finance critically important government operations.</p><p>\"I'm introducing this bill because I believe climate change is one of the gravest threats mankind faces, period,\"Durbin said.\"President Trump and Republicans in Congress still don't take climate change seriously. If we want our children to inherit a livable planet, then this bill would guide us in the right direction and should be part of our overall strategy to combat climate change.\"</p><p>\"Congress has an important role to play in addressing climate change. While local communities and states are on the front lines of this crisis, we need a federal response to support their efforts. This fund would give the federal government and everyday Americans a way to invest in climate change mitigation and resiliency projects,\"said Deutch.</p><p>Bond proceeds from Durbin and Deutch's bill would fund a new \"Climate Change Resiliency Fund,\" administered by the Commerce Department, for grants to be used on climate change resiliency projects, such as flood control, structural fortifications, forest fire prevention, desalinization plants, cooling centers, and more. Eligible grant recipients include federal, state, and local governments; utilities; tribes; transit groups; nonprofits; coalitions; or other organizations as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the bill creates a Climate Change Advisory Commission of 11 bipartisan members appointed by the House, Senate, and President to establish program requirements, and to vet and approve these projects.</p><p>More information on the bill is availablehere.

I'm Zain Asher in for my colleague Julia Chatterley. Just ahead on today's show mug shot moment Former President Donald Trump surrendering to authorities in the U.S.State of Georgia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thursday night Trump arrested for his alleged role in the 2020 election case other co-defendants turning themselves in overnight as well. Georgia prosecutors now looking at an October trial date, even though that is considered very, very soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also Prigozhin probe the Kremlin today denying any responsibility for the plane crash that appears to have taken the life of Yevgeny Prigozhin. Moscow also blasting U.S. President Biden's comments on the matter the U.S. and the UK, still probing the circumstances of the crash. We'll have a live report for you just ahead.</p><p>And fed focus global investors await a closely watched speech from Fed Chair Powell beginning one hour from now at the Fed's Jackson Hole Wyoming Symposium. ECB Head Christine Lagarde will also speak later in the day as well.</p><p>Jackson Hole is a venue where central bankers traditionally deliver very important policy messages so we'll be watching what he says very closely. And ahead of Powell's comments U.S. stocks remain on track for mostly higher open. European stocks on the invites as well after a weak Asian handover.</p><p>Reports today say that China is poised to take new steps to boost investor's confidence. But the Shanghai Composite and the HANG SENG closed lower on the day Japanese stocks fell by some 2 percent.</p><p>That was a lot so much to get through this hour. But let's get the latest from Georgia. Donald Trump has surrendered himself in Georgia and he's also become the first Former U.S. President to have a mug shot taken? Here it is.</p><p>Oh, you don't have the mug shot yet but he flew into Atlanta to be booked at Fulton County jail on charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. It is the fourth time Trump has surrendered himself to authorities in less than a year Nick Valencia has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mug shot an inmate number p01135809 will forever be associated with a Former President Donald J. Trump was arrested on state charges related to election subversion in Georgia Thursday. He was booked and released on bond at the Fulton County Jail. Former President took to the right wing network Newsmax to discuss his surrender.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Terrible experience. I came in I was treated very nicely, but it is, what it is. I took a mug shot which I never heard the words mug shot that wasn't didn't teach me that at the Wharton School of Finance. And I have to go through a process since its election interference.</p><p>VALENCIA (voice-over): Ahead of his surrender, Trump agreed to a $200,000 bond and other release conditions including not using social media to intimidate co-defendants and witnesses in the case. This is the fourth criminal case filed against the Former President this year.</p><p>TRUMP: What has taken place here is a travesty of justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. And everybody knows that.</p><p>VALENCIA (voice-over): Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing in this case, and the others.</p><p>TRUMP: It should never happen. If you challenge an election you should be able to challenge an election. I thought the election was a rigged election, a stolen election. And I should have every right to do that as you know --</p><p>VALENCIA (voice-over): Trump shared his mug shot and his Truth Social and his ex-account formerly known as Twitter, with the words election interference and never surrenders below it. It was his first tweet on X since January 8th, 2021 two days after the insurrection. The Former President was not the only high profile person to surrender on Thursday.</p><p>Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows surrendered himself to the Fulton County jail. He has been charged with violating Georgia's RICO Act and soliciting a public officer to violate their oath. He denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY: A Fulton County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment.</p><p>VALENCIA (voice-over): Just last week, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump and 18 co-defendants with meddling in the 2020 Georgia presidential election laws. On Thursday, the District Attorney filed the motion requesting a trial date of October 23rd, 2023.</p><p>That date was set after Kenneth Chesebro the co-defendant who was considered the architect of the fake electors plot requested a speedy trial as his right. His trial was set to begin on that date. Trump's attorneys say he opposes the proposed trial date.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>ASHER: And new this morning the Kremlin says genetic testing is underway to determine if Wagner Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash outside of Moscow on Wednesday. This as Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says allegations that Russia gave an order to kill the Prigozhin or a complete lie.</p><p>Meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin broke his silence on Thursday he offered his condolences and called the mercenary leader, a talented man who made serious mistakes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT: First of all, I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of all the victims. This is always a tragedy. Preliminary information suggests that Wagner Group employees were also on board.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Matthew Chance joins us live now in St. Petersburg. So Matthew, do we have any more clarity just in terms of what exactly caused the crash that killed allegedly killed I should say Yevgeny Prigozhin. Matthew, can you hear me?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I can't hear you very well Zain. And no, we don't have any more clarity is the short answer to that. We know that this plane for no apparent discernible reason at the moment that we've established sort of crashed about 60 miles outside of Moscow.</p><p>We know that all 10 people on board, including we believe Yevgeny Prigozhin the Head of Wagner, but also other senior Wagner figures were killed. And what's happening now is that there's still an investigation underway, which the Russian authorities are heading up, and they say they're going to get to the back of it or bottom of it rather.</p><p>But of course, online, you know, amongst Russians you speak to there are all sorts of speculation about there being a bomb on board about it being a victim of anti-aircraft fire. There's a lot of suspicion around the country as well, for many of the Russians I've spoken to off camera who believed the Kremlin may have been implicated as revenge, after Yevgeny Prigozhin led that abortive uprising against Kremlin authority in June of this year.</p><p>A revenge killing in other words, that's something that within the past few hours, the Kremlin has categorically denied. They've called that allegation absolute lies. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesman, saying those words to reporters earlier, but nevertheless, it's still a suspicion held by many people around Russia, even if they weren't to express it publicly for understandable reasons.</p><p>You can see, we're here at this makeshift memorial in St. Petersburg, which is Prigozhin's home city, it's Putin's home city as well as you may know. It's right in front of the Wagner headquarters. And you can see people are trickling in, they're putting these flowers here, these memorials photographs of Prigozhin over there. Little messages to him, saying how much he's missed and how much of a hero he was for Russia I've been showing this, but I'll show you as well.</p><p>This is a very heavy sledge hammer with Wagner on it, it's become a symbol. This hammer this kind of tool of the extreme violence that Wagner used to enforce discipline and to exact revenge amongst people it regarded as straight as a hammer like this that was used to brutally execute someone they regarded as a traitor and they videoed it.</p><p>And that video really consolidated this idea that Wagner was a ruthless organization that would do anything to protect the motherland, as they as they saw Russia. And so yet, that extreme violence attracted a lot of people. And what's interesting now is that there is this steady stream of people, not just in St. Petersburg, but in Moscow, in other cities around the country coming to pay their respects.</p><p>Not a lot of people, but some, and that just gives you a little indication of just how popular figure Yevgeny Prigozhin was and how Wagner continues to be popular in the minds of many Russians?</p><p>ASHER: At the same time, that as you point out, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin denying they had any involvement in terms of Prigozhin's alleged death, but Vladimir Putin also coming out and saying, but yes, he was talented, but he made some serious mistakes. All right, Matthew Chance live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Greek authorities say they're dealing with a large resurgence of wildfires, scorching parts of the country fires north of the Greek Capital, Athens are still under control today with parts of the forest there destroyed overnight.</p><p>Eleni Giokos joins us live now from just outside Athens. Eleni just walk us through what firefighters are dealing with. I mean, these flames seem almost impossible to snuff out and these firefighters are clearly overwhelmed.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They're clearly overwhelmed. They say that they're battling something that is akin to a nightmare every single night. You have to remember when the sun goes down the aerial assistance comes to an end. We've been at the spot for almost two hours. This is Parnitha Mountain. We've said this many times it is the lungs of Athens.</p><p>[09:10:00]</p><p>You can see a fire now -- Virgin forest, so much lighter has already been decimated. We're still seeing flames erupt in certain spots, some of it while we were waiting for you. We saw a fire erupting actually here over to my right. You can see flames that have emerged in Virgin forests Zain.</p><p>Parnitha Mountains still not a controlled area. The fire department says they're still battling blazes many fronts across this mountain. This isn't the only front however in Greece, we've got many others, many wildfires around the country, especially in Alexandroupoli, where that is probably one of the biggest fronts right now.</p><p>We've already had 20 deaths 18 bodies found earlier this week one now due to smoke inhalation another heart attack related to the fires as what authorities are telling us. I want to give you a sense of the numbers in terms of land that has been burned.</p><p>1.3 billion square meters estimated by the EU forest fire information system says has already been decimated that would make it the largest wildfire destruction since records began. In Alexandroupoli 73,000 hectares has been burned out.</p><p>Now the Greek authorities say it's too early to quantify the damage that they will be measuring this after the wildfire season. 79 arrests for arson, so we have climate change issues, heat. You've got wind exacerbating these catastrophic fires. People's homes have been destroyed. And then you have people deliberately setting fires as well.</p><p>Cases of arson have emerged not only here in Parnitha, but also in other areas in Greece as well Zain. But this is a battle that continues. Let me tell you, the people that are fighting on the ground, the women and the men manning the fire trucks, and as well as the planes and the helicopters that we can see ahead of us over there are absolutely heroic. It has been incredible to see the commitment and the heroism in fighting these fires.</p><p>ASHER: And Eleni I am so glad you pointed that out. And when you actually just pan the camera to show those images that kind of smoke billowing in the air just gives you a real sense of what these firefighters are up against. That certainly is a sight to behold Eleni Giokos live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>All right, in other news Jackson Hole is ready for its close up once again. The 46th Annual Fed Economic Symposium at the Western Wyoming Resort area is well underway. Investors are hoping for a kinder gentler speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year. Powell is hawkish smash that message in 2022 sent the DOW tumbling one thousand points.</p><p>Matt Egan joins us live now. Matt, the markets are desperately hoping there's not going to be a repeat of that. And I don't think there will be because we're in a much different place compared to last year when Jerome Powell made that speech last year, inflation was around 8.5 percent now it's around 3 percent. So things have really changed,</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Zain it is very different. But you know, the market reaction from the past few days does suggest that at least some investors are having some flashbacks to last year's Jackson Hole sell off that you referenced.</p><p>During that speech Powell, he warned that the process of bringing down inflation would be painful to consumers. Investors are sort of on edge about what Powell was going to say today, especially about where interest rates go from here. Let's look at where investors are pricing things in heading into this speech.</p><p>At last check, there is an 80 percent chance priced into the market of no interest rate hike in September, and about a 20 percent chance of a quarter of a point rate hike. So that is before Powell speaks. We don't know exactly what Powell is going to say.</p><p>He should acknowledge that improvement in inflation that you just pointed to and the fact that the process of getting inflation back down hasn't been nearly as painful as many people anticipated, recession fears have eased. But Zain, I don't think that we should expect Powell to take a complete victory lap.</p><p>Not yet. Inflation is not back to 2 percent. And Powell knows that if he's too dovish here, he could end up setting off a celebration on Wall Street and that is not what he wants. Because if markets spike and bond yields cool off, you know, that's actually going to make financial conditions easier.</p><p>And that's going to make it harder to get inflation back down. So I think at best, Powell is going to take a measured approach, talk about the progress and allude to more work done, but at worst Zain he could deliver another sobering message that investors don't want to hear.</p><p>ASHER: And it's interesting because one of the biggest mistakes the Fed made believed that inflation post pandemic was only going to be transitory that it was just going to be temporary. And so because of those errors there's so much more pressure on the fed on Jerome Powell to really get things right from here on now.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>Matt Egan live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, straight ahead, we'll discuss Putin, Prigozhin and swirling questions surrounding the plane crash with Kremlin Critic Bill Browder. You won't want to miss it stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: The apparent death of former Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash is raising a number of questions, not just who might be behind it but how exactly it happened remains a mystery, Katie Polglase investigates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): Falling from the sky the plane reported to be carrying the Wagner Leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, coming two months after he launched a mutiny against Russia's Leader Vladimir Putin. He was widely seen as a man on borrowed time.</p><p>As footage started to emerge on social media of the crash CNN's open source team began piecing together what happened. The aircraft associated with Prigozhin is RA02795. It makes frequent trips between Moscow and St. Petersburg. CNN geo located the main crash site to here and you can see the same tail number visible amid the debris.</p><p>The plane had left Moscow at 5:55 pm local time 12 minutes later, the location is no longer detectable but Public Flight Tracking Site Flight Radar 24 still receives information on its altitude.</p><p>POLGLASE: The last minute of the recorded flight is key; you can see here the flight's altitude is erratic. It's going higher and lower, before it eventually plummets. Now aviation experts told us this is highly unusual. And it suggests those on board were trying to stabilize the plane after something happened to it. In other words, the disruption was not big enough to obliterate everyone and everything instantly.</p><p>POLGLASE (voice-over): Expert's opinion is split on what exactly happened likely an explosion, perhaps a bomb on board or a missile hitting it or even something else. Whatever it was clearly powerful as the plane is visibly falling without a wing.</p><p>The tail ends up over here 2.6 kilometers away from where the rest of the debris lands. Videos show fires at the crash site, some are graphic human remains strewn amid the debris. Since then, Russian authorities have taken the bodies away for examination and began an investigation. For many have already made up their minds as to who they think was behind the Wagner aircraft's violent end Katie Polglase, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>ASHER: The U.K. Ministry of Defense says it is highly likely that Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is dead in its latest intelligence update, the MOD said there is not yet definitive proof that Prigozhin was actually onboard this plane. However, it is highly likely that he is indeed dead.</p><p>Joining me live now is Bill Browder, CEO and Co-Founder of Hermitage Capital Management. He was once the largest foreign investor in Russia until he was declared a threat to national security for exposing corruption in state owned companies. He's also the Author of Freezing Order, a true story of money laundering, murder, and surviving Vladimir Putin's wrath.</p><p>Bill, so, so good to have you with us on this story so many questions here. Just give us your take on this plane crash, the fact that Yevgeny Prigozhin was allegedly on board, what we don't know and where we should be treading very carefully?</p><p>BILL BROWDER, CEO OF HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Well, first, I think we should just state the obvious that Putin has a long history of killing his enemies. He declared Yevgeny Prigozhin to be his enemy after Prigozhin launched a rebellion on June 24.</p><p>The only thing surprising in the last few days is that it took two months for Putin to act out on his vengeance. I think it's absolutely obvious and clear, that's when you see this plane falling out of the sky, whatever caused it to fall out of the sky, that this was an assassination organized by Vladimir Putin to kill his most important opponent at the moment.</p><p>ASHER: So what do you think that if it is Putin behind it, and I obviously want to be very careful as a journalist, if it has been behind it? Why do you think he did indeed, wait two months?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, this is the question that everyone was asking me every day during this two month period, like, what is it? You know, I mean, if you think about it, I know many, many people who are sitting in jail for just saying bad words about Putin.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>BROWDER: People from the Russian opposition. I was friends with Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed for just criticizing Vladimir Putin. And to have a guy who organized armed rebellions survive for two months is just inexplicable. I mean, the only thing I can speculate on is that Prigozhin was such a powerful person in terms of all the different mercenary operations he was running abroad.</p><p>In Africa, I think there's 17 countries in Africa where Wagner is active, that they need to figure out how to replace them? What their contingency plan was? And they needed to get that all in place before they actually took them out. But that's the main mystery is not that they killed him.</p><p>That's the most obvious thing in the world. But that was ready to be humiliated. And really, he was humiliated for two months while Prigozhin was running around as if nothing had happened.</p><p>ASHER: You know I find fascinating is that obviously if you're, Yevgeny Prigozhin, you know how the game goes, you know, the game that you're in. And so you are aware that from the day of that failed rebellion, that you are essentially a marked man, your days are numbered.</p><p>Wouldn't somebody like Yevgeny Prigozhin have a ton of Prigozhin's in place for this possible eventuality?</p><p>BROWDER: For sure, and if you remember when on the day of the rebellion, the Russian secret police, the FSB, raided his office and raided his home. And they found multiple passports with different names in them they found wigs and other disguises. And this is a man who has spent his whole life dealing with subterfuge and all this type of stuff.</p><p>Prigozhin to be traveling on his own name on the flight manifest of his company's jet in a predictable manner makes no sense. And the only thing I can imagine is that, you know, we always tend to overestimate these people in Russia. Maybe he just, you know, got stupid and got comfortable and you know, went on 10 trips, nothing happened. He thought, OK, I'm safe. And then they got him on the -- .</p><p>ASHER: Yes, that's another thing. I mean, there was a plane crashed back in 2019, where people thought that Prigozhin, people thought that he had died and he emerged perfectly fine. And well and just in terms of, you know, what you talk about this is a man that had so many different passports.</p><p>This is a man who had body doubles. You point out there are wigs and masks and that sort of thing. And then for him to be on this plane with other members of the senior leadership of Wagner just seems somewhat uncharacteristic.</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>That's where I'm wondering how cautious we should be in terms of just sort of ultimately believing that what the Kremlin is saying happened actually happened?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, I agree everything that the Kremlin says you should assume is a lie. But the fact of the matter is that he's not emerged. I mean, it's probably a 95 percent chance he's dead, but there's a 5 percent chance that he's going to pop up somewhere and thumb his nose at Putin and say, OK, I'm coming to get you.</p><p>But, you know, we're in the world of total craziness here and conspiracy theory and so, who knows?</p><p>ASHER: And just in terms of how this is playing out in the Russian media, I mean, how is Vladimir Putin came out yesterday offering condolences to Prigozhin's family, saying, you know, I think we could actually read into some of the words that Putin use.</p><p>He said that Prigozhin was a talented man, but he made very serious mistakes. How is all of this playing out in Russian media?</p><p>BROWDER: Well, I mean, this is just typical mafia talk the way he does it, you know, he kills Prigozhin, and then it can says condolences to his family. I mean, it's just as this is like Godfather mafia stuff. And the words that he says, are just so sort of with double entendre, you know, saying he was a very effective man, but he made mistakes and so on.</p><p>It's just all Putin speak, mafia speak. This is how he does stuff. And this is what Putin wants everybody to know is that on one hand, they deny having any involvement in his killing, which they announced today through Putin's press spokesperson Peskov. And on the other hand, Putin wants to look everybody else in the eye and say, this is what happens to traders and that's a --</p><p>ASHER: -- very clear message.</p><p>BROWDER: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: -- don't even think about the -- . All right Bill, we have to leave it at that, so, so good to have you on the program, so grateful. Bill Browder, CEO and Co-Founder of Hermitage Capital Management, we appreciate it and Author of Freezing Order, thank you. Alright, stay with CNN coming up. We are outside the Fulton County Courthouse with the latest on historic fourth arrest of Donald J. Trump, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back. Back to our top story this hour, the fourth arrest and the first mug shot of Donald J. Trump, now released on a $200,000 bond from Fulton County Jail in Georgia where he is charged with efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election. The Former U.S. President has returned to New Jersey and is calling the criminal case against him a quote travesty of justice.</p><p>Zachary Cohen joins us live now outside the Fulton County Courthouse. So Fani Willis, the District Attorney here is trying to get a trial off the ground and how she's going to manage to do it in about two months. Is that realistic, Zachary?</p><p>ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: It's an aggressive timeline for sure. And, you know, it remains to be seen if she can actually get that going by October 23. That's the date that she wants to start this trial. And she wants to try all 19 of these defendants, Former President Donald Trump and 18 others together.</p><p>Now we're starting to already sees, potentially some cracks in that plan. One of the defendants Ken Chesebro tried to request a speedy trial as it is right here. But a judge has set his date for October 23, but none of the other defendants. So we're about to see how prosecutors navigate this really complex.</p><p>And, frankly, historical case involving a Former President and 18 other individuals and including his Chief of Staff or Former Chief of Staff and who we also saw get a mug shot at the Fulton County jail when he surrendered yesterday afternoon. It's a really data first yesterday, Donald Trump coming to turn himself in, but we also have a lot more first to come as this case now as this trial plays out.</p><p>ASHER: And just how complicated is it? You know, there are so many co- defendants. Last time I checked, not all of them have actually turned themselves in, has that changed at this point?</p><p>COHEN: So as it stands as of this morning, 17 of the 19 defendants, including Trump himself have turned themselves in we do expect the other two, to turn, themselves in before the noon today deadline. You know, but if that doesn't happen, obviously authorities their arrest warrant will become active.</p><p>And authorities will search for them and try to bring them into custody. We but we do expect all 19 to eventually surrender. And then we can start the next phase of this case, which is looking ahead to how a potential trial may play out and how it may play out involving the Former President and Former government officials here in the U.S.?</p><p>ASHER: Right, Zachary Cohen, live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, back to Business News. Now U.S. stocks up and running for the final session of the week a higher open across the board as we close out the Final Four trading week of August. My god, this year has gone by so quickly.</p><p>Where stocks and today's session has a lot to do with what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say about the state of the U.S. economy and interest rates. Powell speech before Global Central Bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming begins at less than half an hour from now.</p><p>Powell's comments are not expected to be as gloomy as last year thanks to a brighter inflation picture. But do not expect a mission accomplished moment either. No one's going to be doing victory laps here. Many investors do anticipate additional Fed rate increase somewhere down the line.</p><p>Ken Rogoff joins us live now. He is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University and also Former Chief Economist at the IMF, Ken, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>KEN ROGOFF, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS &amp; PUBLIC POLICY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: I think what's really interesting about this is sort of trying to compare what Jerome Powell is going to be saying this time around compared to last year, when you think about last year speech, it was very short, only about nine minutes. And he sort of made his dance very clear.</p><p>He said, look, we have to get inflation under control doesn't matter what it costs, there's going to be a lot of pain in terms of how consumers experience the next sort of 6 to 12 months, but we have to do it because we don't want inflation to become entrenched in the economy.</p><p>Just walk us through how things have changed for the better this time around compared to last year.</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, let's walk back two years, not last year, but two years ago, he was much more optimistic in his tone, and thought that the inflation would go away mostly on its own without aggressive interest rate hikes. That proved to be wrong. And he did an about face good for him the next year.</p><p>And it's come out very well. I mean, I think there was overwhelming view that if you raised interest rates that fast something would break, you would see a recession. We haven't in fact growth, particularly in the labor markets still phenomenal. Inflation still elevated.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>It's the headline it's 3 percent but I think you know looking deeper it's probably more in the 4 percent plus range. So he's certainly not going to say mission accomplished. But I think it's going to be very hard for him to resist taking a little bit of a victory lap here because everyone said, you know, things were going to be a disaster and they haven't been.</p><p>ASHER: So then why haven't they been a disaster? As you point out, when you raise interest rates consistently, there are usually nasty side effects that come with that. But we haven't seen that this time around why?</p><p>ROGOFF: Most of the answer is we don't know, after the pandemic, a lot of things have been strange people rethinking their lives, consumers behaving differently, people working from home, and economists haven't sorted it out. I do think a piece of it, though, is that the underlying interest rate that would keep the economy at a stable growth rate, with low inflation is much higher now than it was a few years ago.</p><p>Remember, we had this period of almost a decade where interest rates were basically zero. And it was unprecedented, and eventually up and down the line. And I think that's not the case anymore. And I suspect, one of the things, Powell, will emphasize is yes, eventually we're going to cut interest rates, but don't assume they're going to go back to what you had gotten used to.</p><p>ASHER: And just looking ahead, post this speech when it actually comes to interest rate hikes and obviously the last time around, we got a pause. Are you anticipating a pause next time around or another 25 basis point hike?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, I think if things go the way they're going now, it'll be a pause. They had thought just at the end of June, that they were going to hike again in September that they'd be hiking, they strongly indicated that but the data had been better, particularly on inflation than they thought.</p><p>And I think more of the question in this speech, especially, is not what are we doing in September? But what are we doing over the long haul? What's our vision, because remember why it matters. It's not just for the overnight interest rates for mortgage rates. That's a big deal.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>ROGOFF: People borrowing for 30 years. And everybody's trying to get a grip on what's next, not just what's in September.</p><p>ASHER: Going back to one of the things you touched on earlier, just this idea that things are so much better than what the Fed had been anticipating this time last year, when Jerome Powell gave Jackson Hole speech in 2022. You know, we talked about the fact that we've avoided the recession that people had feared, or the pain that Jerome Powell had talked about. Do you think that things could still turned sour? Or is the worst of it, basically, behind us at this point?</p><p>ROGOFF: Well, a little bit depends on what they decide to do. So they've gotten inflation down, I want to say into the 3.5, 4 ranges and the pain hasn't come yet. A question they have to decide is how fast do they want to bring it down to their target, which is ostensibly too?</p><p>And I think if they were to try to do that fast, as you said, raise interest rates in September or raise them again in November. Well, I do think that would make a big difference. I think it is still fragile. It is amazing. We haven't had more problems.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>ROGOFF: But I suspect what Powell, will signal are tough. We're going to get it down to 2 percent, without kind of trying to indicate that we're doing it fast that we're going to be willing to take our time that would make sense to me. But at the same time saying, look, it's gotten better than everyone was calling us.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, the Fed made some mistakes in the past just in terms of believing that inflation was going to be transitory post pandemic, but this is one aspect that they've really gotten right, just this idea of being able to raise interest rates without the sort of nasty side effects that most people would be anticipating. Ken Rogoff, live for us there.</p><p>ROGOFF: No --</p><p>ASHER: -- go ahead.</p><p>ROGOFF: -- they've got lucky.</p><p>ASHER: -- they've got lucky. Most people don't really know why it's turned out this way. But I'm sure Jerome Powell will take it. Ken Rogoff, live for us there.</p><p>ROGOFF: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you so much. We appreciate it. All right, still to come here on \"First Move\", defiant in the face of outrage. Spain's Football Chief gives a new statement about the kissing scandal at the Women's World Cup. All details, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>ASHER: In the past hour or so Spain's Football Chief has insisted that he will not resign despite facing fierce criticism. There's been outrage after a video showed Luis Rubiales forcibly kissing a player on the lips following World Cup victory last week Spain's World Cup victory last week.</p><p>FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Rubiales, who, they say may have violated the rules that deal with offensive behavior. Rubiales says that he will fight this to the end. And he has lashed out at what he calls \"Fake Feminism\". Andy Scholes has the story, so, Andy with the tide of public opinion really against him. How long can he realistically hold on for?</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: We will see, Zain. I mean, this is kind of a surprise what happened today. You know, there were multiple reports over the last 24 hours that Luis Rubiales he was just going to step down as the Head of Spain soccer but that certainly did not happen this morning.</p><p>He actually doubled down on his stance Rubiales claiming that that kiss during the World Cup Trophy celebration was mutual, despite the player Jr. Mostly saying yes, she didn't like it. She didn't expect it. And Rubiales while speaking at that extraordinary General Assembly on Friday, he says he's going to fight this to the end calling what was happening to him unjust campaigns and fake feminism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUIS RUBIALES, SPANISH FOOTBALL PRESIDENT: It was spontaneous, mutual you for it. And with consent, which is the key. This is the key to all the criticism of all the campaign which has been mounted in this country that it was without consent. No, it was with consent.</p><p>I said a small peck and she said OK, then the peck happened during all of the celebration, with her patting me on the side a few times, and then excusing herself, with one more hand on the side, and going off laughing. That's the whole sequence. That the whole world understood that the whole world thought was an anecdote. And above all, she says was an anecdote, and nothing more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: Now Rubiales got multiple rounds of applause during his speech actually got a standing ovation at the end from some in attendance and including some women, but so many have continued to speak out calling for Rubiales to be fired. Spanish soccer star Hector Bellerin, posting on Instagram, it's a genuine embarrassment what's happening.</p><p>He went on to say, the narcissist never thinks he's made a mistake. He's capable of lying, manipulating the truth and converting the victim into the perpetrator with the aim of maintaining his power over others. You know, so Zain, the question is, you know what happens next? Well, the Sports Minister in Spain is expected to hold a press conference at 11 am, Eastern this morning.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>We'll find out you know, if they put plan on taking those next steps to remove them but with him not going voluntary now it becomes a process.</p><p>ASHER: Alright! Andy Scholes, we'll see what happens live for us there. Thank you so much. All right still to come, it is morning here in New York. But it's always wine o'clock somewhere and that somewhere could soon be in Sweden. Find out why, next?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: All right, when you think of wine producing nations, you might think of the Sun soaked vineyards of Italy, France or even South Africa, perhaps not really the Northern European landscape of Scandinavia. But as global temperatures rise because of climate change, some winemakers are using the opportunity to grow their industry.</p><p>Further that you're looking at some of the wines made by Blaxsta, a vineyard and restaurant in Sweden which uses new varieties of grapes adapted to the country's climate. Goran Amnegard is Blaxsta's owner, and joins us live now. Goran, thank you so much for being with us, so you're in your car, you're actually on your vineyard in Sweden, but you're in your car because it's raining.</p><p>GORAN AMNEGARD, OWNER OF BLAXSTA VINEYARD AND RESTAURANT: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Yes -- so happy to talk to you. Just talk to us a bit more about how climate change is affecting the winemaking industry in Sweden, because when a lot of us think of where wines come from, of course, we think of France, we think of Italy, we think of Spain. I mentioned South Africa as well. We don't necessarily think of Sweden, we don't think of Scandinavia. How might that be changing?</p><p>AMNEGARD: Well, you know, I was one of the -- here. When I started 23 years ago, I used to live in Toronto, went back from Toronto to Sweden, started vineyard and growing things like Mirlo, Chardonnay, Vidal making ice wine, but you know, what people forgot is that we have 25 percent more daylight hours during growing season.</p><p>So because we're not you know, and in the growing season, you know, may September and that's so amazing. And the grades develop perfectly. I've been very fortunate. I got gold International Mine Gold Challenge four times actually. And it's so much the nature. Yes, warming, global warming.</p><p>Yes, maybe part of the equation. But there's so much more to it, you know, it's just not that a little bit warmer. Yes, it is, absolutely. And then you can discuss to the end of the day, or the reason for it, but daylight situation and then things like that it's also part of the equation.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>ASHER: So if Sweden is emerging as a sort of young winemaker country, the question then becomes how does it sort of promote that to sort of wine consumers around the world? It's one thing to sort of become a young winemaking country. It's another thing to sort of convince consumers that you are there who are traditionally used to wines coming from other countries.</p><p>AMNEGARD: I export most of my wines, even to Asia, but Europe, you know, it's still such a small production, and little there is made, seems to be consumed and stay in the country. As it grows bigger, there will be quantities for exports. So that's why most people outside the country here haven't been exposed to it. I produce ice wine. The funny thing is that people in Sweden don't drink ice wine, but the rest of the world.</p><p>ASHER: OK.</p><p>AMNEGARD: I'm very, very happy with it. It's kind of -- . So yes, I'm a little bit of an exception here, because I export my wine. But there are a few others in the country. And it's growing. I mean, I think I had, my license is 0001. So I was the first licensed winery here in Sweden.</p><p>ASHER: Wow!</p><p>AMNEGARD: I think they're up to 30, 34 or 35 by now. But you know -- .</p><p>ASHER: You are a trailblazer.</p><p>AMNEGARD: This --</p><p>ASHER: And so Goran, how much government support is there? I mean, this is a young industry. You know, normally if there are young industries that are growing, there will be some government support to help get that industry off the ground. Is there anything like that in Sweden, just in terms of the government being behind you?</p><p>AMNEGARD: Well, I got to tell you a funny story. I mean, this municipality, where I am, they had a few years ago, the Chairman of the municipality, he was alcoholic, so they should banned all kinds of alcohol. It was even such an issue for me to have signed on at road saying winery because they consider we've been promoting alcoholism.</p><p>I managed in the end to get the sign for restaurant, hotel and winery. But it was kind of a little bit of a no, we have a monopoly in this country. So consumer has to go to specific state owned stores to buy alcohol of any kind via wine and distilled. So it's a little bit of an awkward, little bit the same as in Ontario, sort of --</p><p>ASHER: So it's a completely different setup. But, Goran, I'm out of time. I'm so sorry, but wish you the best of luck.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: I hope it stops raining soon.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: And it's still -- very busy today</p><p>AMNEGARD: Yes --</p><p>ASHER: And that you wanted to do a live show from outside on your vineyard while you're working. But we're so grateful to have you on all the best.</p><p>AMNEGARD: Tell your viewers to try Swedish wine. All right, thanks.</p><p>ASHER: Thank you, Goran Amnegard, live for us, thank you. All right, there is a new K-Pop band on the scene in South Korea, but this group has a twist. None of the members are actually Korean. Paula Hancocks has more from Seoul.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Water bomb 2023, a K-Pop concert in the heart of Seoul, where staying dry is not an option. And a key gig for Blackswan, a K-Pop band with no Korean members. They're not the first to try it. But Blackswan are hoping they will be the act to break through.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Some of the obvious question, you're a K-Pop group. There's no K there's no Korean does it matter?</p><p>FATOU, MEMBER OF BLACKSWAN: Actually, there's K because we think in Korean and K-Pop is Korean pop. So as long as the language is there, it is still K-Pop.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): Singing in Korean Black Swan members say they also draw on influences from each of their cultures. Their recent song Karma was filmed in India where band member Sriya is from the music video MV has been viewed over 5 million times on YouTube.</p><p>SRIYA, MEMBER OF BLACKSWAN: It has been really, really great because it's a first ever MV shooter in India. And also it shows like a proper Indian culture, Indian dresses outfit and then the dance.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): Blackswan members are also from Brazil, Senegal and the United States, a global band for a global movement, the band says.</p><p>FATOU: And if they see us, like we're all different color, they feel different backgrounds, cultures, and if they see us achieve it, it's going to put more fire underneath behind them.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): One difference, the members did not start as young teenagers undergoing brutal K-Pop training as other young hopefuls do. Two members only signed up two years ago.</p><p>YOON DEUNG-RYONG, CEO OF DR MANAGEMENT: They're usually four to five years of training period as they need to learn the language, dance moves, singing, even though they're being trained within the K-Pop system. We need to respect the cultures of these members and we can't just tell them what to do.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): The group says training was still tough, but what about the Korean public reaction to this different brand of K-Pop?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are other famous bands such as Twice and IZ*ONE who are considered K-Pop bands even though they have foreign members from Japan and elsewhere.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's more like a mindset for me like K-Pop, it's not just because you're Korean and making music in South Korea.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As there are no Koreans in the group, I've always looked at the group with doubts about them being K-Pop although they technically are.</p><p>HANCOCKS (voice-over): A number of non-Korean K-Pop groups have emerged over recent years.</p><p>LEE GYU-TAG, ASSOCIATED PROFESSOR OF CULTURAL STUDIES AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITYKOREA: I believe there may be a possibility to have, let's say, American K-Pop British K-Pop or Japanese K-Pop. Why not? But it may also make K-Pop lose their Pacific identity is K-Pop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Be unique!

Today it's a $170 million juggernaut, and one of the world's most outspoken businesses. In a moment when brands are trying desperately to find a voice, here's how one quirky family-run company became a new model for corporate success by doubling down on its vibey values.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One sunny morning not too long ago, a dozen or so new hires arrive at the headquarters of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps in Vista, California. They've shown up to a fairly standard-looking suburban office park to be initiated into their standard-sounding roles in liquid-soap production, shipping, and regional sales. But the normalcy ends quickly on Planet Bronner. They park their cars in a sea of solar-powered electric-vehicle chargers and then walk past a company-tended garden, where fruits and vegetables are anyone's for the taking. Inside, they are greeted warmly-and perhaps thrown off guard a bit-by the Dr. Bronner's welcome wagon, a crew of impossibly upbeat humans who can best be described as vibey. These cultural ambassadors, when they are not planning their annual Burning Man pilgrimages, wear tie-dye mechanic coveralls and drive around Dr. Bronner's HQ blasting disco from a psychedelically outfitted fire truck. They call themselves the Foamy Homies.</p><p>The new hires make their way to a conference room for their employee-onboarding session, where they have been prompted by the Foamy Homies to introduce themselves by showing off their preferred dance moves while a fog machine pumps vaporous clouds into the room. By the time this fresh crop of Dr. Bronner's employees hears from the company's CEO, David Bronner-who long ago revised the abbreviation to stand for Cosmic Engagement Officer-they have realized that this will not be a standard manufacturing gig at all.</p><p>\"I'm on the All-One path,\" announces David-who uses he/they pronouns-standing before the group, referring to the sweeping ideology coined by their eccentric grandfather, Emanuel Bronner. Emanuel, who possessed no advanced degree but was undeterred in adopting a physician's title, founded Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps in the late 1940s, in large part because he wanted to broadcast his ideas about unifying the human race, and his All-One dicta are still printed on the brand's soap-bottle labels. In the early years of the company, Dr. Bronner's was a genuine grassroots operation-a cult-favorite brand passed, if not directly from the hands of Emanuel himself, among hippies camping out in vans at places like Woodstock. Emanuel would distribute his product by promising a free bottle of soap to anyone who would show up to listen to him proselytize the All-One message.</p><p>Two generations later, Dr. Bronner's has vastly outgrown its quirky, humble origins and become the top-selling natural soap brand in North America. The company now sells not only its liquid soap but highly successful lines of balms, toothpastes, coconut oil, and hand sanitizers, in addition to newly launched chocolates that were immediately hailed by gourmands as a premium product. Today, the iconography of its labels-and Emanuel's far-out messaging-is imprinted firmly in the psyche of the American consumer. And yet, even as so many Americans have come to possess a fondness for the soap, the raw numbers around the success of Dr. Bronner's-over $170 million in revenue in 2022-are still kind of staggering. Especially staggering, maybe, to the customers who've been affectionately buying its signature minty formula since the days of the natural-product boom of the '60s and '70s. Emanuel's grandsons David and Michael now preside over an empire in which a bottle of Dr. Bronner's soap is sold every two seconds or so.</p><p>But perhaps more notable than the company's sheer growth is the durability of Emanuel's founding ethos, the All-One ideology that the family still suffuses into every element of the business. All-One-and its attendant Moral ABC-is the quasi-religious doctrine that was the very reason for the existence of Dr. Bronner's original soap bottles, which served as vessels for his beliefs. If you are ever bored in the shower, you can give yourself an extensive education in the chaotic, zealous, AND EXCLAMATION POINT-FILLED! All-One philosophy via the tiny text on the labels. Boiled down to its essence, All-One has a pretty unimpeachable and evergreen mandate: \"In all we do, let us be generous, fair &amp; loving to Spaceship Earth and all its inhabitants,\" Emanuel wrote. \"For we're ALL-ONE OR NONE!\"</p><p>It's this messaging that has helped gird the family with an ethical framework to weather the forces-globalization, rapid growth, incessant corporate buyout offers-that have perennially threatened to undermine its mission. Most Dr. Bronner's products are produced and packaged at the company's headquarters in Southern California, which is home to factory space filled with refinery equipment and high-tech bottling devices. Just around the bend from the new-employee onboarding session sits a group of massive industrial tanks filled with the coconut, olive, and palm kernel oils used for Dr. Bronner's liquid soaps.</p><p>David Bronner, at 50, is lanky, lumbering, and low-talking, but has a brain that moves quickly. David is eager to talk about their spirituality and makes reference to \"that mystical Christian\" deep inside. Within a few minutes of taking the microphone at employee orientation, David will discuss more existentially heavy topics with this group of strangers than most people will address with their spouses over the course of a lifetime.</p><p>Dr. Bronner's has always been a family company, and present among the new employees and the Foamy Homies is David's younger brother and the company's president, Michael Bronner. On the periphery of the room is their brother-in-law Michael Milam, the company's COO, a brainy and straitlaced numbers guy with degrees in business and theology. And in the corner sits the matriarch, the company's long-running CFO, Trudy Bronner, Michael and David's 79-year-old mother. A Christian and a conservative, Trudy married into the family-and, eventually, the business-when she wed Emanuel's late son Jim in 1968. Today she gazes upon the scene with a faintly absent look that indicates she has grown desensitized to the idiosyncrasies of her eldest child. David is now talking about their spiritual journey and the idea of the divine. \"When you're ready,\" David tells the group, \"the divine is going to meet you.\"</p><p>The other topics David covers include, but are not limited to: their grandfather's failings as a father. Their Christian-Reaganite upbringing. The philosophical awakenings they experienced as a student at Harvard in the '90s. The hypocrisy of the criminal justice system. The promise of regenerative organic agriculture. The prolonged legal battle that Dr. Bronner's waged against the DEA after the company reformulated its liquid soap to include hemp seed oil in 1999. The production of olive oil in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The trip they took to Amsterdam after college, and, perhaps most crucially, the spiritual rebirth experienced there by way of psychedelics.</p><p>The trip was so mind-blowing that David has since made it their life mission-and eventually the company's-to drive efforts in the United States to legalize psychedelics, and more broadly, end the drug war. And they have succeeded, in spite of any skepticism and unease that some colleagues might have toward this trippy streak. In 2021 the company spent over $4.4 million on drug and psychedelics policy reform efforts, part of which helped pass a Colorado ballot measure last year to decriminalize certain psychedelics.</p><p>By the time David starts talking about metaphorical ego death and coming face-to-face with Jesus while under the influence of psychedelics, everyone in the room has become pretty inured to the far-out nature of the spiel. \"All of a sudden I'm talking to God, and I'm like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wait a minute.</emphasis> If this love is real, and this is true, then why does it suck so bad? Why are there people being murdered and raped, and all of the worst stuff? Seeing the allness of it all&amp;#230;\" David trails off. \"And then seeing Jesus stepping in, just calm and compassionate. Not trying to explain, not trying to complain, just stepping in.</p><p>\"I was like, Wow, I want to be like that,\" they continue. \"That's what we're here to do. We're here to serve. We're part of the divine that can activate the divine, and stop that aggression and oppression and make peace on earth.\"</p><p>Can a soap company activate the divine? Dr. Bronner's has succeeded at realizing so many seemingly unfeasible visions over the last quarter century that it is not outside of the realm of possibility. Three decades ago, when Dr. Bronner's was a super-minty soap brand remembered fondly by washed-up hippies, all of this highfalutin talk was mostly still just talk. But in the years since Emanuel Bronner's progeny took over the business, Dr. Bronner's has quietly but self-assuredly evolved beyond its humble origins to become a legitimate titan of the beauty and cleaning industries as well as a household staple. The brand no longer relies on hippies passing Bronner's bottles between VW vans, seeing as how Gwyneth Paltrow and Meghan Markle openly profess their love for the lavender soap.</p><p>Growth is one thing, but Dr. Bronner's has managed to become a major player in its market while painstakingly encoding its ethics into every step of the production process. In fact, it could be argued that Emanuel Bronner predicted the current era of ethically minded business, and certainly ethically minded marketing. And now the humble soap brand finds itself at the vanguard of every philosophical and logistical question that American entrepreneurs are grappling with right now. All of its good deeds-from rigorously engineered fair trade supply chains to charitable donations and environmentally minded manufacturing-are thoroughly cataloged in the Dr. Bronner's annual public accountability report card, the All-One! Report.</p><p>These ideals are built into the complex corporate architecture of Dr. Bronner's-a certified Benefit Corporation as of 2015-and an agreement between David and Michael ensures that the business won't be sold off to a global conglomerate anytime soon. It's a fate that's befallen so many household-name natural health and food brands, many of which began to flourish in the same era following the late-'60s counterculture revolution that Dr. Bronner's did. It may seem easier than ever to stock your cabinets with granola-y, righteously sourced products, but that's only because they've been subsumed into the old corporate model: Tom's of Maine is now Colgate-Palmolive. Burt's Bees is Clorox. Trader Joe's is operated by the Albrechts, the family behind Aldi. And Bragg-of apple cider vinegar fame-was recently acquired by an investor group that included Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. Perhaps the only other business similar in scale and ethical ambition is Patagonia, the company so steadfastly resistant to the conventional corporate model that its founder and his family transferred the company's ownership into a trust and nonprofit organization last year to insulate it from the forces of capitalism.</p><p>\"Most brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate that has not a lot of ethics in the world,\" David Bronner says. \"We get to rock it how we want here.\"</p><p>\"Most brands and companies our size sell out to some soulless conglomerate that has not a lot of ethics in the world,\" David reminds the group. \"We get to rock it how we want here. Soap, work hard, rock that product, and then&amp;#230;joy. Drop the joy in there, make sure we're having fun while doing good in the world and making good products.\"</p><p>In this obscenely scam-ridden day and age, it is reasonable to assume that anyone sermonizing like this in the realm of business is one false step away from being exposed as a charlatan. But the Bronners genuinely do seem to, in the parlance of thought-leadership conferences, walk the walk. The combination of Christian clemency and drug-induced ego surrender is potent. The executives, despite ranging from the conservative to the progressive, have all agreed to cap their own executive salaries at five times the lowest-paid fully vested Dr. Bronner's employees, which means they cannot earn more than about $300,000 per year. It's a policy that frees up funds for a waterfall of annual charitable donations and, more importantly, an enviable company culture for its over 300 workers. Dr. Bronner's boasts the sort of employee benefits that would make Bezos shudder, including a health-insurance policy with company-paid premiums, bonuses, free daily vegan lunches prepared by the Foamy Homies, access to therapy, and, as of 2022, coverage of ketamine-assisted mental health treatment.</p><p>This bouquet of life-changing employee benefits is probably why, on the day of their initiation, the new employees of Dr. Bronner's seem rapt by David's pontification. They gamely participate in the celebratory session and erupt with applause when David wraps up their spiel.</p><p>\"We just get to live the dream here,\" David says. \"Thanks for joining the team. Right on.\"</p><p>There is one person present who can bring everyone down to earth a bit and remind the crowd that this, after all, is a job. This reminder arrives when David's mother, Trudy, takes the lectern. \"We do a lot of good, and we think we treat you right. And we expect you to work hard,\" she says. She points to a cluster of six core principles of Dr. Bronner's that have been printed onto the wall behind her. \"Every time I give a tour to little kids, it's like, What's the first thing you have to do to be a successful person, really? That's the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">work hard.</emphasis>\"</p><p>\"We are an unusual company,\" she adds, speaking almost as if she is addressing her sons as much as these new employees. \"Not every day will you have an experience like you had today.\"</p><p>\"I don't like to be joint-interviewed with my brother,\" Michael explains with a grin after the onboarding session, as we sit down at a picnic table outside. \"I love my brother, and we can rap back and forth, but when he's telling the story and I'm waiting for my chance to interject, he pivots to psychedelics. Like, no, we're not talking about the 1960s!\"</p><p>Michael is 48 and, in spite of the tie-dye T-shirt he's wearing today, is more buttoned up than David. He says they are \"85 percent the same,\" but the differences are meaningful. Warm, thoughtful, and possessed by so much nervous energy that he's capable of pacing seven miles over the course of a day while taking phone calls, Michael tells me that he's just started watching <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Succession.</emphasis> He cannot help but laugh at the family business of it all. (\"It's exactly what I <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">don't</emphasis> want to be,\" he says.) There are, of course, imperfect parallels to be spotted between the two families, chiefly the trio of siblings grappling with the future of their family business. (Michael and David's sister, Lisa, will arrive at headquarters later today.) Michael has a lightly adversarial relationship with his older sibling that mostly manifests as Michael affectionately trying to get a word in edgewise. But now, alone, he holds the floor, and he has plenty worthwhile to say.</p><p>We are ostensibly here to discuss his role as president of the company, but any discussion of Dr. Bronner's inevitably turns into a remembrance of family lore. \"I grew up with my grandfather being the man on the mountain,\" Michael tells me. \"It wasn't until I could literally understand Shakespeare that I could understand the depths of what he was talking about.\"</p><p>Dr. Emanuel Bronner loved aphorisms and slogans. The sermonizing soap bottles were so endemic to the Bronner brand that David eventually figured out how to create labels that wouldn't disintegrate in the shower. Today, the fine print of the label has become so iconic that it is often used in memes by people who want to signify that a rant is taking place.</p><p>Bronner-who adopted the \"Dr.\" title in his 30s-had good reason to fight for unity. Born into a family of Jewish soap-makers, he immigrated to the US from Germany in his early 20s, just over a decade before his own parents were killed in the Holocaust. As a young man, he began sharing his grandiose ambitions to unify the human race, preaching a little too vehemently for some people's liking. He was committed to Elgin State Insane Asylum, from which he eventually escaped. Once he settled in Southern California, he got in the habit of lecturing in LA's Pershing Square and doling out bottles of soap to his audience. When he realized some in his crowds were grabbing his soap without actually listening to his disquisitions, he began printing the Moral ABC on the label.</p><p>Decades later, after he'd gradually gone blind-a development he attributed to electroshock therapy he'd received as a young man-Emanuel was still single-mindedly fixated on the Moral ABC. When his small grandchildren came to visit him, he'd quiz them on these principles. \"He would basically lecture us with our feet dangling off the couch as if we were PhDs in comparative religion,\" says Michael. \"We'd be looking at the cracks in the ceiling, and he'd ask us, 'What's the 13th?' 'All-One, Grandpa!' \"</p><p>That the company would stay in the family was hardly a foregone conclusion. Emanuel's wife died young, and his sons, Jim and Ralph, were relegated to the foster system while Emanuel fervently promoted his All-One message. Jim remained semi-estranged from his father for most of his life. It was only when his sons and Trudy began to handle the Dr. Bronner's company that Emanuel's ambitious vision could be translated into a formidable business model. Even without his father's consistent physical presence, Jim inherited a passion for charity and a sense of feverish ingenuity. When he and Trudy took over the company-which had been in financial disrepair-they set about eventually transferring about a third of the business's worth over to the Boys and Girls Club of Escondido in the form of a large plot of land.</p><p>Years later, Jim's child David traveled their own circuitous path to the soap business. In 1997, in the aftermath of their Amsterdam awakening, David became a parent and moved back to California. They were toying with an idea that had once seemed preposterous: joining the family company. A year later, Jim died of lung cancer and David found themself in charge of Dr. Bronner's, which was still operating out of Jim and Trudy's home. Michael joined two years later. When the two set out to acquire a line of lip balms, they knew they needed someone a bit more logistically oriented to helm operations. They called Michael Milam, husband of youngest Bronner sibling, Lisa, and recruited him to move across the country and run production. Today he remains a key executive and a sensible counterweight to David and Michael. \"I'm here because they trust me, and because I don't think like them. They needed someone who&amp;#230;who knows how to close a drawer, I'll just say it that simply,\" Milam tells me wryly. \"The Bronner blood needs to marry into people who can close drawers.\"</p><p>Back when Jim married Trudy, he was partnering with someone who could close a drawer. It was Trudy, a former math teacher, who became the company's de facto bookkeeper in the late '80s, sorting out the haphazard finances and logistics. \"There were just boxes of stuff, randomly thrown together,\" she remembers. \"There was no oversight, no direction.&amp;#230; I'm not an accountant or a CPA, but since I was good with numbers, that was how I became the CFO.\"</p><p>Anyone who knew Trudy in those days would not have predicted her gradual warming to the drug-reform movement. Trudy had long treated her son's crusade for psychedelics with a healthy skepticism. You won't find her dropping acid anytime soon. (Trudy puts it bluntly: \"This is not my thing.\") And yet she was able to open herself up to ideas about criminal justice reform and psychedelic therapy when David showed her a fresh angle on the topic. They told the family: \"Look, I know you think I just want to go to Burning Man and take psychedelics, but this is really helping veterans,\" David remembers. \"Pretty early on, they understood that this is actually life-saving medicine. It's not just so David can go party.\" David might be the psychedelic guru of the bunch, but it was Michael who pushed his mother even further ideologically. It was deep into COVID, and even though Dr. Bronner's was doing more sales than ever-everyone wanted soap-Michael found himself in a depressive hole that couldn't be fully treated by antidepressants. David suggested he try ketamine-assisted therapy, and it worked. When he passed that information along to his mother, he says she took on a new understanding of psychedelic therapy.</p><p>\"We needed to make sure <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the myth of my grandfather matched the actual product,\"</emphasis> says Michael Bronner of the company's efforts to remove artificial coloring and certify their soaps as organic.</p><p>\"I want to see decriminalization too,\" Michael says. \"But for David, it could be assumed that there's an ulterior agenda for him. He wants a lot of these things to be legalized because he wants to be able to do them freely.\"</p><p>Michael was able to get his mother's blessing on rolling out the ketamine benefits to their employees. During this process, she was tuned even closer to David's frequency. \"She even surprised me,\" David says. \"She was like, 'Yeah, we gotta end the drug war.' \"</p><p>When I ask Trudy about psychedelics later, I expect her to bristle, but she doesn't. \"If it can help people, then more power to it. I'm willing to listen,\" she says. Then she hearkens back to a story she told me earlier about sports coaches describing David as the most \"coachable\" athlete they'd ever worked with. \"Maybe I'm coachable too,\" she says.</p><p>At one point, I ask David how the company's new factory workers tend to feel about all the woo-woo of the business. They tell me a story. When they arrived at the company, David says, they came in with big ideas. They were <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">on fire,</emphasis> ready to hire a workforce composed of activists. Their father quickly disabused them of the notion. \"He was like, 'You need to humble yourself,' \" David says. \"It's a Mexican American and Catholic workforce.\" Then Jim asked his child what the most important part of the company was. David responded: The soap, the causes, the customers? Jim rebuffed them. \"He was like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">No. No. No. It's the employees.</emphasis>\"</p><p>Then David returns to another parable. \"Someone asked a janitor at NASA, 'What are you doing?' And he said, 'Oh, I'm helping put a man on the moon.' \"</p><p>People love to grouse that we don't make anything in America anymore. Instead, we rely on grandiose ideas, clever marketing, and unorthodox CEOs to lather up excitement toward whatever speculative vision is in fashion at any given moment. This is part of the reason why American entrepreneurship has fallen into its current identity crisis: We are so detached from the reality of making things that we're relegated to the fantasy-lands of founders. We are so susceptible to being hoodwinked by charismatic entrepreneurs peddling unfulfillable promises that even the richest and most powerful elites can be swindled by a 30-year-old cryptocurrency idealist. There's an entire genre of streaming television dedicated to scammer CEOs. In the company's formative years, Emanuel openly admitted that the soap was merely a vessel for his All-One message. But a bit like the mythology- and marketing-minded founders of today, Emanuel Bronner didn't always live up to the virtuous ideals he promoted: In 1988, his son and daughter-in-law cleaned up a massive tax mess he'd left that had put him in bankruptcy. Later, when Emanuel's grandchildren took over the company, they discovered that the soap was not as natural as the label had advertised. Fixing his shortcomings was a massive undertaking. But it meant that the Bronner children and grandchildren learned some serious lessons about how to make good on ethical business promises-lessons that many corporations and investors are having to grapple with these days. \"First and foremost, we needed to make sure the myth of my grandfather matched the actual product,\" Michael Bronner remembers. They launched a yearslong process of removing artificial coloring and certifying their soaps as organic.</p><p>Given the virtuosic advertising sensibility that the Bronners have in their DNA, it would be easy to assume that marketing is a major expense in their business. And yet, they have historically spent very little on conventional advertising. They don't need to: David knows the value of a good stunt. Whether it's caging themself with hemp plants in front of the White House or helping fund a hotline for people to call when they're having bad trips, David understands the inherent value of messaging. David's title may be Cosmic Engagement Officer, but they also double as de facto marketing guru, working to benefit the company as well as causes David believes in.</p><p>And yet, behind all the generous charitable donations and the employees' interest in Burning Man, Dr. Bronner's remains at its core a company that manufactures a product that people love. Every step in the supply chain and assembly line has been painstakingly optimized to ensure that the soap is the cleanest, most ethical, and efficacious version it can possibly be. And all of the Bronner children, through the enthusiasms of their patrilineage and the decades of work experience they've had at the company, are intimately acquainted with every minute detail of their soapy birthright.</p><p>One afternoon, I tour the factory spaces with Michael Bronner and his sister, Lisa. Lisa is Michael Milam's wife, and perhaps the most straight-and-narrow of the siblings. She runs Going Green, the company's educational blog, where she advises readers on how to best clean stainless steel or wash a dog with Dr. Bronner's products. Together, the pair reminisce about the days when their father used to show up unsolicited and offer to help put out forest fires or contain fumes from chemical spills with the magic foam he'd invented. \"Area Man shows up to fight forest fire with foam,\" Michael says, still amused and in awe of his father's antics.</p><p>Jim's kooky ingenuity is still deep in the blood of the Bronners, who like to geek out over the subject of soap. As we walk into the main production building, Lisa explains the factory's soap reactors, which, thanks to expanding sales, keep being upsized. The new reactor, at 7,000 gallons, is so massive that the family had to cut a hole in the ceiling of the factory space and crane it into the building. \"Soap is such a simple, simple reaction,\" Lisa says. \"You could totally do this in your kitchen.\"</p><p>\"My brother was in a science fair in third grade, and he made soap out of cigarette ashes and butter. The poor judges had to wash with it. It does wash, but it leaves a really nasty smell,\" Michael explains. \"Cooking over a fire was when the first soaps were made. The fat from the meat would drip into the ashes.\"</p><p>Michael and Lisa bring me through the bar-soap manufacturing area. \"Ohhh, they're doing almond today!\" Lisa exclaims, inhaling deeply. \"I love the almond.\"</p><p>We head toward the bar-soap mills, where extra-long bricks are pumped out and then guillotined into smaller portions. \"Smells and looks just like marzipan,\" Michael says.</p><p>\"With a cheese grater, you grate a bar of soap and it looks exactly like mozzarella,\" Lisa says. For a few moments, it's as if the two have been transformed into children invited to Willy Wonka's factory, delighting in each sensory detail of the complex machinery and the magical products they manufacture in front of their very eyes.</p><p>Lisa tells us about an article she read recently about a woman who'd been buried in highly alkaline soil two centuries ago. \"They exhumed her, and her body had turned into soap,\" on account of a reaction with fats in the human body.</p><p>\"That,\" Michael says, \"is how I want to go.\"</p><p>CARRIE BATTAN<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is a writer in New York.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GQ-00166979_GQ_0723_07</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GQ2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68J8-H9B1-JDMC-117W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338866</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GQ</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59733\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0016-6979</issn><volume>Vol. 93</volume><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>0Summer 2023</dateText><date month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"/><date month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"/></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Charles W. Herbster came VERY close despite tremendous headwinds!' </p><p><br/>But answering why Herbster lost, and how Pillen won, is more complex than the national narrative questioning whether Trump's hold on Republican politics might be waning. Following are observations and analysis based on interviews with political scientists and reporting from the campaign trail. <br/> Three things Herbster did wrong <br/>Nebraska gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster gives an interview to One America News Network before former President Donald Trump's rally in Greenwood, Nebraska. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>First, Herbster spent less time on the campaign trail than either of his top competitors, Pillen and State Sen. Brett Lindstrom. Herbster instead was the first candidate to run TV ads. <br/>Herbster campaigned in person only a handful of days each month until March, based on internal campaign schedules and other information confirmed with former Herbster campaign staffers. In at least a third of Nebraska's counties, no record shows Herbster attending a campaign event during this cycle. <br/>Being there matters in rural Nebraska. In the sprawling 3rd Congressional District, voters prefer meeting candidates face to face. Third District voters made up 47% of the GOP's vote for governor this year, and Pillen won the district. <br/>Second, the Conklin Co. CEO tried to nationalize the governor's race, focusing on the Trump endorsement and talking about national issues, including repeating Trump's claim that the 2020 election was rigged. He emphasized critical race theory, the government's pandemic response and illegal immigration. <br/>Herbster rarely articulated a clear plan for Nebraska, other than saying he wanted to help market the state.  <br/>Critics said he told different audiences what he thought they wanted to hear.On taxes, for example, he expressed support for a consumption tax to offset property taxes with some rural audiences. He told some urban audiences he preferred an 'all-of-the-above' approach, including income tax cuts. <br/>Third, with his TV ads, Herbster waited too long to define himself in a positive light and spent more time criticizing Pillen, his top opponent, political observers said. <br/>Nebraskans often recoil from negative ads when they are easily tied to a particular candidate running them, said Paul Landow, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. <br/>Herbster also ran an ad attacking State Sen. Julie Slama[2], who has accused Herbster of groping her at a political dinner in 2019. He has denied any wrongdoing and has sued her. She responded by counter-suing him. <br/>He spent much of his ad time defending himself for making late property tax payments, for owning businesses and homes outside Nebraska, for groping allegations made by eight women[3], including Slama, and for suggesting eliminating sales tax exemptions. In other words, Herbster spent a lot of time pushing back against criticism, said John Hibbing, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. <br/>Herbster was more positive and less of a flame-thrower on the stump until the race's final weeks, when he struck a more aggressive tone, alleging conspiracies against his candidacy[4]. <br/>'I think Nebraskans in general are pretty fair-minded people, and I think that in the case of Herbster, they were easily able to separate the bull [expletive deleted] from the reality,' Landow said of voters. 'They act as referees in these kinds of contests, and here they saw a foul, and they blew the whistle.' <br/> Three things Pillen did right <br/><br/>First, Pillen spent the bulk of his campaign on the road. The Columbus-area hog producer and University of Nebraska regent made more than 400 in-person appearances, reaching all 93 Nebraska counties. <br/>He campaigned often in small-group settings, at restaurants, community centers and churches. He made 30 appearances with the Nebraska Farm Bureau, which endorsed him. He had additional help from Americans for Prosperity. <br/> Jim Pillen, a NebraskaGOP gubernatorial candidate, speaks during a town hall forum hosted by his campaign and the Nebraska Farm Bureau at Pals Brewing Co. in North Platte, Nebraska. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>Pillen focused attention on the state's second- and third-tier cities, including North Platte, Beatrice and Fremont. That type of approach has helped candidates win before in close GOP primaries, Hibbing said. The results showed in a geographic analysis[5] done by Nebraska Public Media. <br/>Second, Pillen took advantage of his access to the statewide network of contacts, volunteers and campaign staff tied to Gov. Pete Ricketts and other supporters in the Nebraska political establishment. <br/>They helped Pillen notch a win in Lancaster County, home to NU's main campus, despite the candidate criticizing the university. <br/>Third, Pillen campaigned as a hard-core conservative. His views on issues echoed many of Herbster's political stands, including opposing critical race theory and illegal immigration. On abortion, Pillen said he wanted to outlaw it in Nebraska. <br/>Observers said early on that it looked like Pillen was crowding a lane already occupied by Herbster, but without Trump's endorsement. The strategy ended up proving smart, Hibbing said. <br/>Pillen offered a safe harbor to conservative voters who liked Herbster's confrontational style, but with less drama when scandals kept hitting Herbster near the end of the race. <br/>'Nebraskans are pretty big on Trump's policy positions,' Hibbing said. 'If they can get that without all the drama, then why not?' <br/>Said Landow: 'Pillen appeared to be as conservative as Herbster, but a nice-guy alternative.' <br/> Three outside factors <br/><br/>First, outside money played an outsized role in the race. Ricketts and other donors spent nearly $3 million on third-party TV ads that attacked Herbster and Lindstrom. That let Pillen focus ads on his own message, rather than spending advertising time criticizing an opponent. <br/> State Sen. Brett Lindstrom speaks with a potential donor during a fundraiser in Omaha last week. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner) <br/>Lindstrom gained momentum until he faced about $1.7 million in attack ads. He couldn't afford to push back to defend attacks on his legislative voting record. <br/>Herbster faced about $1.2 million in negative outside TV ads. They reinforced concerns about Herbster enough that he had to spend advertising money and time defending himself. <br/>All told, Herbster spent about $12 million on the primary[6], including more than $11 million of his money. Pillen spent more than $8 million, mostly from donors. Lindstrom spent $2.6 million. <br/>Second, one of the most unusual outside factors in the race: the sheer number of fires Herbster had to fight during the race.  <br/>He paid his property taxes late nearly 600 times[7] over more than two decades, which became the subject of negative ads. <br/>He was dogged with questions about whether his primary residence was in Nebraska or Missouri. Ricketts and others criticized him for operating his largest business, Conklin Co., out of state, in Missouri and Minnesota. <br/>At Trump's urging, as Politico reported[8], Herbster and his campaign team reacted so aggressively to the women's groping allegations that he kept the story alive for most of the final month. <br/>The allegations led all 13 women in the Nebraska Legislature to call on Herbster to quit the race. Several of them created a fund[9] to pay the legal costs of people making credible allegations against him. <br/> Former State Sen. Theresa Thibodeau, a Republican from Omaha, is campaigning for governor of Nebraska. (Courtesy of Thibodeau for Governor) <br/>Herbster also was dealing with Theresa Thibodeau, who quit the campaign as his running mate and later criticized him as being poorly prepared[10] to run for office. She stood up for the women accusing Herbster of groping. Thibodeau finished ahead of Lindstrom in Dundy, Hayes, Loup, McPherson, Perkins and Valley Counties, rural areas where Herbster needed votes. <br/>'There were all these brush fires that were significant but, taken one at a time, could possibly have been handled,' Landow said. 'But when they all blew up together, you ended up with a major forest fire that was impossible to fight.' <br/>The race's third outside factor of note was Trump's endorsement, which propelled Herbster into frontrunner position in October. <br/>Trump visited Nebraska late in the race[11] and held a telephone town hall for Herbster. Several of Trump's former lieutenants, including Kellyanne Conway, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, worked for or with Herbster's campaign. <br/>Some political observers questioned whether Trump endorsed Herbster too soon in what was sure to be a competitive open primary. Herbster spent months advertising that he was Trump's favored candidate. <br/><br/>That left little room for the big bounce Trump has given other candidates in competitive GOP races by endorsing later in the election cycle, including the U.S. Senate primary in Ohio. <br/>Hibbing said the Trump endorsement was important no matter when it came. Part of Herbster's problem, he said, is that it appears 'he thought that was all he needed.' <br/>Said Landow: 'I think that Trump's endorsement was really important for Herbster, but it wasn't enough. The forest fire overtook him, and even Trump couldn't put it out.' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/subscribe\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/10/pillen-snatches-victory-from-trump-pick-herbster-in-nebraskas-gop-gubernatorial-primary/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/10/pillen-snatches-victory-from-trump-pick-herbster-in-nebraskas-gop-gubernatorial-primary/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/28/herbster-targets-groping-accuser-slama-in-paid-campaign-tv-ad-perhaps-a-first-in-nebraska/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/28/herbster-targets-groping-accuser-slama-in-paid-campaign-tv-ad-perhaps-a-first-in-nebraska/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/14/gop-state-senator-seven-other-women-say-charles-herbster-groped-them-he-denies-allegations/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/21/charles-herbster-continues-to-say-groping-allegations-are-false-politically-motivated/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/21/charles-herbster-continues-to-say-groping-allegations-are-false-politically-motivated/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/map-nebraska-republicans-voted-along-geographic-lines/\">https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/map-nebraska-republicans-voted-along-geographic-lines/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/in-nebraska-gop-governors-race-pillen-outraises-opponents-herbster-self-funds-lindstrom-a-strong-third/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/in-nebraska-gop-governors-race-pillen-outraises-opponents-herbster-self-funds-lindstrom-a-strong-third/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3newsnow.com/news/investigations/nebraskas-charles-herbster-paid-property-taxes-late-nearly-600-times\">https://www.3newsnow.com/news/investigations/nebraskas-charles-herbster-paid-property-taxes-late-nearly-600-times</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/trumps-risky-primary-play-rallying-for-a-longtime-ally-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-00028611\">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/28/trumps-risky-primary-play-rallying-for-a-longtime-ally-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-00028611</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/26/four-state-senators-raising-money-for-womens-defense-in-wake-of-allegations-against-herbster/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/04/26/four-state-senators-raising-money-for-womens-defense-in-wake-of-allegations-against-herbster/</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/28/ex-running-mate-former-staffers-call-herbster-unfit-to-be-nebraska-governor/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/03/28/ex-running-mate-former-staffers-call-herbster-unfit-to-be-nebraska-governor/</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/01/trump-rallies-for-herbster-defends-fortenberry-and-attacks-bacon-sasse/\">https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2022/05/01/trump-rallies-for-herbster-defends-fortenberry-and-attacks-bacon-sasse/</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Incredibly, this film (out October 28 on Netflix) is his first since 'Coraline' back in 2009. For a while it seemed like Selick, whose singular genius was responsible for 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the animated intrudes in Wes Anderson's 'The Life Aquatic' (among other things), would never make another movie. Thankfully that isn't the case. </p><p><br/>'Wendell &amp; Wild,' based on an original idea of Selick's, concerns two demons (voiced by Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key) who work in a hellish theme park amongst the 'souls of the danged' (according to Selick they aren't quite as bad as the souls of the damned). Together, the demons attempt to utilize a human child named Kat (voiced by Lyric Ross) as their ticket to the land of the living. Imagine 'Beetlejuice' but with a wider variety of influences (including, crucially, Afro-Punk music) and, you know, entirely animated in stop-motion. <br/>After talking with Selick, the existence of 'Wendell &amp; Wild' feels like a miracle. The story of how it came to be is just as frightful as anything Selick could have dreamed up. <br/>NEW TRAILER HERE <br/>What Happened to Selick's Pixar Projects <br/>'Coraline,' since it was the last feature project that Selick completed, is as good a place as any to start when it comes to explaining where the director has been for the past decade. Based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, 'Coraline' was released in February 2009. It was warmly received by critics and wound up a modest box office hit, grossing more than $100 million on a $60 million budget. It also formally announced the arrival of LAIKA, a stop-motion animation studio based in Portland, Oregon (it was formerly known as Will Vinton Studios), as a major player. It was assumed that Selick would stick around LAIKA, since they shared his dedication to stop-motion and his somewhat macabre sensibilities. <br/> Also Read: <br/> The 7 Best New Movies on Netflix in September 2022[1]  <br/><br/>But a year later, in an unprecedented move, Disney announced a long-term deal with Selick, along with two feature projects - an original stop-motion film called 'Shademaker' (later retitled 'The Shadow King') and an adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 'The Graveyard Book' (a riff on 'The Jungle Book' but with monsters instead of giant cats). What's more, Selick's stop-motion unit, known as Cinderbiter, would be a subsidiary of Pixar. The warehouse where production would take place wouldn't be far from Pixar's sprawling campus in Emeryville. ('The Nightmare Before Christmas' was also produced in the bay area.) It would also reunite Selick with his old CAL Arts chum John Lasseter. Sadly, this wasn't meant to be. <br/>'We developed it pretty far, we went into production, had shot about five minutes, and they went through a big a shuffle, a big change, at Disney,' Selick told TheWrap about how far 'The Shadow King' got. 'Two things: the budget kept going up, because John Lasseter couldn't help but come in and change everything every few months, because that's who he is, and maybe that's how the best work has been done there. At the end of the day, it was costing too much and it was stop-motion. It was a little weird and they decided to pull the plug. Never saw it coming, but it was also a relief, because to constantly start over and over and over while you're trying to give people work to do out on the stage, was a challenge.' <br/>The fact that the project was stop-motion, which was the major selling point (interestingly Pixar had attempted to buy Will Vinton Studios before it became LAIKA) was now a liability. The feature became a bug. 'There had been three stop-motion films that had come out right before that. 'Frankenweenie' was the last of them,' Selick explained. 'None of them were very successful at the box office, so it was decided. It happened with me before, it probably will again. Stop-motion, why would we take a chance on this ancient technology?' <br/>Netflix<br/>Of course, death of what would be known as 'The Shadow King' would also impact 'The Graveyard Book,' which in the years since Selick's deal began has cycled through a number of filmmakers (currently Marc Foster is attempting to bring it to life). 'That went away as well, but they still never cracked it,' Selick said. (He claims he did crack it and knew how to tell the story.) Disney publicly announced an $80 million write-down on the projects and returned the rights to 'The Shadow King' to Selick. He never found someone who was interested in finishing the project. <br/>'As far as what I went through, it took a long time to get back on my feet to try to get something else going again. I just felt, Wow, if they'll shut down a movie when you've already started That was something I couldn't have imagined,' Selick said. 'It just made me really leery of trying to do something else.' <br/>That is, until he met Jordan Peele. <br/> Also Read: <br/> 'Nope' VFX Supervisor Reveals Secrets of Jordan Peele's Horror Epic: From Gordy to Jean Jacket[2]  <br/><br/>The Big Comeback <br/>Before 'Get Out,' Selick had met with Peele, who was in the process of establishing his production company, Monkeypaw. Selick pitched a few ideas, including one idea that Selick had originally thought might make a good book - the idea that would eventually become 'Wendell &amp; Wild.' At first, Peele was anxious to set the movie up before he filmed 'Get Out,' unsure of whether the movie would connect with audiences and worried that he might be squandering his one chance at directing. Oh how wrong he was. Peele would win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (it was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Director) and the film made more than $255 million on a budget of $4.5 million. Last year the Writer's Guild of America named Peele's script for 'Get Out' the best screenplay of the 21st century. <br/>'There were two main things that were in our favor,' Selick said. '#8216;Get Out' was great and it was a huge hit, so everyone wanted to be in business with him. We had a good tailwind, but more importantly, we didn't go to many places, because we knew everyone wants to meet Jordan about anything, but there really were only going to be a few places who would take a chance on an unusual film like this. Netflix was one of them and they said all the right things. They said, 'We don't just develop films. If we like your project, if we like you, when we say 'Yes' it's basically a green light that we will make this film.'' Selick added: 'We did go to hell and back, but they held true. They made the film, they supported the film.' <br/>Selick admits that 'there were plenty of bumps along the way' in the production of 'Wendell &amp; Wild,' chiefly that they had secured their deal before Netflix had formally installed animation executives at the company. When the new executives came in, largely comprised of former DreamWorks employees, they were somewhat shocked at the deal Selick and Peele had secured. They were particularly startled by the movie's PG-13 rating. 'They just couldn't imagine that an animated film would work as PG-13, but they worked hard at adjusting. The collaboration was rough at first, but we got to a really good place,' Selick said. 'It only took a year, but we got in tune with each other, in terms of studio creativity.' <br/> Also Read: <br/> 7 Spooky Netflix Shows to Watch to Kick Off the Fall Season[3]  <br/><br/>Not that there weren't disagreements. 'One of the biggest fights I had with the studio was They kept saying, 'Couldn't you have Kat smile a little earlier in the film?' I said, 'No, that's not who she is. She can't do that until she's in another place and she will be. That just betrays who she is,'' Selick said. (Kat's parents are killed in a car accident early in the film.) 'She's a badass, and she's got a reason to be,' Selick said. <br/>When I asked if he had ever considered making 'Wendell &amp; Wild' an R-rated movie, since Netflix has an adult animation division, he said no. 'The story itself didn't lend itself to that and that seemed like a bridge too far,' Selick said. 'Other stories might work well within an R-rating, but this one didn't need it.' His personal philosophy when working on projects like 'Wendell &amp; Wild' is to 'scare, not scar' his younger audiences. <br/>Earlier this year another new executive, Karen Tolliver, was brought on to oversee all of Netflix's animation output, formerly of Sony Pictures Animation. 'She had some strong ideas about the music, about the songs, and I was just like, I want to be done, I've been on this show for so long, but she's smart and they were really good ideas,' Selick said. 'They spent more money and we were able to bring back some needle drop songs that we had had to lose, because they weren't free.' <br/>After a test screening for 'Wendell &amp; Wild' 'knocked it out of the park' with a certain age group (10 to 14), they spent another month-and-a-half 'recutting and shifting,' according to Selick, to make it more accessible to an older age group. 'It really helped the film,' Selick said. <br/>There was also the pandemic. <br/>Netflix<br/>Much has been written about how computer-animated projects like Disney's 'Turning Red' or 'Encanto' were mostly completed at home, with artists toiling away in their kitchenettes or living rooms to make it to the finish line. 'Wendell &amp; Wild' didn't have that luxury. 'We have to shoot stuff on a stage, so we had to shut down. We did what work we could from home, but then we finally reopened the studio, and all that stuff. The masks, the social distancing, and no more than this many people in.' Selick said that stop-motion is a challenging enough way to make a film and that the pandemic (and the precautions associated with the pandemic) just added to it. There were also, he noted 'a few other natural disasters we faced,' including a runaway forest fire. <br/>Selick produced 'Wendell &amp; Wild' in the Portland area (near where 'Coraline' was produced), a place where forest fires are becoming more prevalent. 'We had a forest fire that was getting so close, we had to evacuate the puppets,' Selick said, referring to the characters in the movie. (Each one is a 'puppet' with a metal skeleton that is manipulated, one frame at a time. Just like Ray Harryhausen used to do it.) 'We thought, It's coming closer and closer, if the studio burns down, what do we need to keep in order to still make the film,' Selick said. Then they realized: 'All the puppets, because they're very expensive, take a lot of time to build, and they're our actors.' The puppets were loaded into cars and driven 'away to safety.' The fire fizzled before it hit the studio and the puppets were safe. Whew. <br/>An Uncertain Future <br/>Before talking to Selick, he did a presentation about 'Wendell &amp; Wild.' Towards the end of the presentation he said something that struck me. It was a simple phrase. But it made my blood run cold. 'If I make another movie,' Selick said, before elaborating on some other topic. I brought this up to him. The world needs more Henry Selick movies. And he turns 70 in November. <br/>'It's always been a battle. I mean the first one wasn't, because it was a gift to Tim Burton,' Selick said, referring to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas.' Burton was a former Disney animator who had left the studio and made it big with hits like 'Batman' and 'Beetlejuice.' Disney wanted him back, so they asked if he wanted to expand a concept he had originally worked on at the studio (and which Disney still controlled): a holiday special in the style of the old Rankin/Bass productions. Burton agreed and installed Selick as the director. The resulting film was so dark that Disney removed their name; it was initially released as a Touchstone Pictures film. In the years since it has become one of the most beloved properties in Disney's vast library; a Halloween stage show at Walt Disney World has 'Nightmare Before Christmas' character Zero interacting with Mickey, Goofy and Donald. <br/>'We did it for a pretty low budget and I was protected. I would get notes and I'd say, 'Tim, what do I do?' He said, 'If you like it, do it. Otherwise, ignore it.' I thought that's how life would be. For my first film, we got total artistic support and I thought it would always be that way,' Selick said. 'It didn't happen again until I did 'Coraline.'' Selick's next project for Disney, a mostly stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's 'James and the Giant Peach' (featuring striking design work by children's book illustrator Lane Smith), was constantly second-guessed. And by Selick's own admission, on his big budget hybrid project 'Monkeybone' starring Brendan Fraser (this time for Fox), he 'crashed and burned.' 'Only in 'Coraline' did I get that full artistic support and I know that, when I get it, my work is better and it's more successful,' Selick said. <br/> Also Read: <br/> The 7 Best New Movies on Hulu in September 2022[4]  <br/><br/>Selick doesn't sound like he demands artistic support and the freedom to do what he wants. He never comes across as temperamental or blustery. He just feels like, if he did a good job with minimal supervision that he would be allowed the same luxuries on the following project. 'After 'Coraline,' I couldn't get that support again, because of the team I was working with, so it took forever to get another film up and going. I look back to 'Coraline,' I would've thought I should've easily been able to make my film after that. It turned out not to be the case,' Selick said. 'With this film currently, we have to see, how does the world respond to it?' <br/>As of now he still has the rights to another Gaiman project; he wouldn't tell me which one but said it was 'based on his best book.' (My best guess is 'Neverwhere.') He's hopeful that he will remain in partnership with Netflix too, even though he admits 'they're going through upheaval, adjustments and changes.' Gaiman has more cache than when Selick made 'Coraline,' something that the director is keen to take advantage of. 'He's actually learned to navigate the system and he's a filmmaker now. He brings a lot of oomph to it,' Selick said. 'Right now, let's wait and see how the world responds [to 'Wendell &amp; Wild'].' <br/>What is very clear is that what happened at Pixar still affects him - and how he approaches projects even now. 'I can't go through what I had to go through after 'Coraline,' to be shut down,' Selick said. 'How do you know, once you start a film, Are they going to let me finish it?' <br/>Finally, Selick concedes: 'I could tell a few more stories. I've got a couple of things, but I'm not counting on them. We'll see.' Like all of Selick's movies, the statement is somewhat uplifting but still couched in sadness, tinged with melancholy. And really, what more could you want? <br/>'Wendell &amp; Wild' streams exclusively on Netflix on October 28. <br/> Also Read: <br/> How 'Honk for Jesus.

As the program evolved, a fourth manufacturer, Nova Bus, was added to the program who would bring in three additional e-buses for the extensive testing. Currently five e-buses have arrived. The rest of seven will be delivered by the end of 2022.</p><p>\"San Francisco will continue to find ways to make our transportation fleet greener and cleaner, while still providing reliable service across our entire City,\" said Mayor London Breed. \"Electrifying our transit sector is an essential part of our Climate Action Plan goals of getting to net-zero emissions by 2040.\"</p><p>Prior to the launch, the e-buses were tested on some of our most challenging routes. The new coaches will be serving the 9 San Bruno, 22 Fillmore, 29 Sunset and 44 O'Shaughnessy lines. The three battery-electric buses, one each from New Flyer, BYD USA, and Proterra, will be running on the same line each day to gather data on how they respond to the challenges of revenue service across our unique geographic terrain.</p><p>\"Muni already has the greenest fleet in North America, especially our trolleybuses that pull power direct from Hetch Hetchy into their powerful, hill-climbing engines, said Jeff Tumlin, SFMTA Director of Transportation. \"This pilot will test to see how battery-electric buses perform relative to our hybrids, and how we should invest to meet SFMTA goals under the City's Climate Action Plan.\"</p><p>Leading up to this launch, the SFMTA has been working with PGandE to complete and update the charging infrastructure, called ChargePoint Express Plus, needed to power our new battery electric fleet. Each bus takes about four hours to charge and the electrical support equipment is enclosed within the Electrical Equipment Center directly adjacent to the charging stations. To date, we have nine of 12 charging stations completed, which are powered by Hetch Hetchy Power. The three remaining chargers are currently in fabrication and anticipated to be delivered in spring 2022. Construction will continue once the three chargers arrive. The overall completion of the installation project is expected for summer 2022.</p><p>As of 2019, 47 percent of San Francisco's greenhouse gas emissions are generated by the transportation sector which is heavily reliant on carbon intensive fossil fuels. Our reliance on harmful fossil fuels is changing the earth's climate and contributes to extreme weather events, increased forest fire risk and sea level rise.</p><p>However, the SFMTA continues to be a leader in providing safe and sustainable transportation options. The SFMTA's energy-efficient Muni fleet contributes less than two percent of the sector's emissions and moves approximately 700,000 every day! Today, the SFMTA operates the greenest transit system of any major city in North America</p><p>###</p><p>Program Background</p><p>We are committed to ensuring that BEBs can deliver the same standard of reliability and service as our current hybrid-electric bus fleet. In recent years, the transit industry has witnessed significant progress in battery-electric technology. However, the question remains of whether BEBs can handle San Francisco's heavy transit ridership and hilly routes. To answer this question, the SFMTA continues to evaluate the battery-electric bus program.</p><p>The BEB program serves as an important step towards achieving the greater goals of an all-electric fleet outlined in the SFMTA's Zero Emission Bus Rollout Plan and a carbon-neutral San Francisco by 204 50. Additionally, this project contributes to the City's Climate Action Strategy goals and supports the City's voter-approved Transit-First Policy established in 1973.</p><p>Environmental Commitment</p><p>San Francisco is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 204 50. The SFMTA, which has operated a network of zero-emission vehicles for almost 85 years, is playing a key role in achieving this goal. Throughout our agency's history, we have consistently and proactively pursued and implemented the latest in green transportation technologies.

Tom Carper, D-Delaware, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following opening statement at a May 25, 2022, confirmation hearing for Joseph Goffman to be assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>\"We are here to consider the nomination of Joe Goffman to serve as Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>\"Joe, welcome back to the EPW Committee. While I know this hearing room brings back memories from your time working with us on this committee, today you join us as a nominee. Thank you for being here and for your willingness to serve our nation at this critical point in our history. Before I talk about Mr. Goffman's experience and qualifications, let me begin by setting the table for what's at stake with his nomination.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, we have come a long way in terms of reducing air pollution and doing so without harming our nation's economy. Since Congress passed the historic Clean Air Act of 1970, we have reduced our nation's soot and smog pollution by nearly 80 percent, while our gross domestic product grew by more than 250 percent, adjusting for inflation.</p><p>\"Along the way, we have found that cleaner air is an enormous benefit to all Americans, with the benefits outweighing the costs by nearly 30 to 1.</p><p>\"Yet, despite all our successes, many of the most vulnerable Americans still breathe unhealthy air, especially those living in disadvantaged and low-income communities. According to EPA's research, nonwhite children today are much more likely to die from air pollution than white children in our country.</p><p>\"We have a moral imperative to do more to help all Americans breathe healthy air. And, we can no longer turn a blind eye to downwind and frontline communities.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have a moral imperative to do all we can to save this planet that we call home from the perils of climate change. But, we are running out of time to change course before it's too late.</p><p>\"Last month, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that it is 'now or never' if we are going to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid a future with disastrous, irreversible climate impacts.</p><p>\"Communities across our country and the planet are already feeling the impacts of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, historic droughts, and other extreme weather.</p><p>\"Just last week, the National Weather Service released its seasonal outlook. It predicted that the drought gripping the American West and fueling record-breaking wildfires would persist throughout the summer. As we gather here today, the state of New Mexico continues to battle the worst forest fire in its history.</p><p>\"To put it simply, the climate crisis is here. We are at a critical point when it comes to addressing this crisis and mobilizing our nation towards a better future by transitioning away from fossil fuels and deploying cleaner technologies.</p><p>\"Fortunately, we have an EPA under the Biden Administration -- in particular, the Office of Air and Radiation -- that's willing to follow the law and tackle these great clean air and climate challenges that lay in front of us.</p><p>\"With all of this said, it's clear the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation has an outsized impact on our lives -- from protecting Americans from planet-warming pollution to cleaning up air toxics to improving vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>\"President Biden selected Joe Goffman to lead this office because he knows that Mr. Goffman is up to the task. Throughout his time at EPA, Joe Goffman has demonstrated his commitment to following the law in a way that provides cleaner air and a safer climate for all, while also providing predictability and certainty for industry -- predictability and certainty are always top priorities for businesses.</p><p>\"A great example of this is Mr. Goffman's integral role in the crafting of the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule while he was at EPA under the Obama Administration. This rule helped reduce mercury and other air toxic emissions from our nation's power plants by 90 percent, protecting the health of pregnant women and children across our nation.</p><p>\"Despite early industry concerns the rule would cause blackouts, there were not any. In fact, the rule was achieved by every utility in the country on time and under budget. Today every major utility organization supports the rule. It has enabled us to achieve major health benefits across this country, which is fundamental to job creation and preservation. This is just one example of why Mr. Goffman is so deeply respected and highly qualified for the job at hand.</p><p>\"Joe has garnered broad support from the environmental community and industry. This includes utility organizations like the Edison Electric Institute, biofuel groups such as the Renewable Fuels Association, Tribal organizations like the National Tribal Air Association, as well as some of our largest unions, including the AFL-CIO.</p><p>\"Even the United Mine Workers, our nation's largest union of coal miners, have voiced their support for Mr. Goffman's nomination to lead the Office of Air and Radiation.</p><p>\"Having worked with Mr. Goffman, I know he is well prepared for this role. He is a life-long public servant with nearly a decade of experience at the Office of Air and Radiation, as well as several stints on our EPW committee, including working for me. He also spent time as a staffer for former Senator Joe Lieberman. We look forward to hearing from Joe today.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7847328 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7847328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J3-N9J1-JC11-12W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 26, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire is about 85% contained, with firefighters aiming to limit its spread to 15,175 acres, McLaughlin added. <br/>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in a 2019 report[1] identified the wildfire risk in that area as 'extreme' because of its proliferation of grasses, shrubs, trees, and other 'wildfire fuel hazards.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-6.16.20-PM.png\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-21-at-6.16.20-PM.png</url> (Courtesy N.J. Department of Environmental Protection) <br/>The blaze serves as an urgent reminder for state environmental officials of the need for good forest management, including the removal of invasive species and tree-thinning to reduce vegetation that can fuel fires, one environmentalist said. <br/>'It was only a matter of time before we had that kind of fire,' said Jeff Tittel, a longtime environmental activist from Hunterdon County. 'They're just lucky it's in the middle of Wharton State Forest and not in like Manchester in Ocean County, where there are thousands of people.' <br/>Investigators early on suspected a lightning strike during the stormy holiday weekend ignited the fire but soon discovered remnants of a campfire someone set illegally in an area not sanctioned for fires, McLaughlin said. <br/>Investigators from the New Jersey State Police, Office of Emergency Management, New Jersey State Park Police, and county prosecutors' offices now are trying to identify the culprit, who could be ordered to pay restitution if found guilty, McLaughlin said. <br/>Officials haven't yet determined how much it has cost the state and local municipalities to fight the blaze. <br/>There's legislation now pending that would address some of these issues. <br/>One bill[2] would require the Department of Environmental Protection to reimburse local municipalities for costs incurred in responding to emergencies in state parks and forests. Another[3] would award local governments state grants up to $1,500 to implement a forest stewardship plan. <br/>New Jersey has almost 2 million acres of forests, accounting for 40% of the state's total land area, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.Wharton State Forest is the biggest one, sprawling over more than 110,000 acres. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Heminghaus_wharton-fire_022-scaled.jpg\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Heminghaus_wharton-fire_022-scaled.jpg</url> The command post off State Route 206 near Wharton State Forest Shamong on June 20, 2022.(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor) Wildfire season longer <br/><br/>The wildfire is the state's largest since 2007, when a flare deployed during a military exercise at the Air National Guard's Warren Grove bombing range sparked a blaze that burned 17,000 acres, prompted thousands to evacuate, and damaged or destroyed more than 50 homes. <br/>The ongoing Wharton wildfire comes at a time when climate change has slowly extended New Jersey's fire season, which once ran from mid-March to late May, McLaughlin said. <br/>'We're starting to see our fire seasons shift and become less seasonal, and perhaps more year-round or more extended,' he said. <br/>A longer fire season hasn't resulted in more fires, though. About 1,000 wildfires occur on average every year, down from about 1,500 annually 20 years ago, McLaughlin said. <br/>Most stay small, burning less than five acres, he said. 'Major' wildfires \u2014 those that spread to more than 100 acres \u2014 generally only occur two or three times a year, he added. <br/>And most are started by humans, whether accidentally or intentionally, McLaughlin said. <br/>Tittel called on policymakers to restrict development in or near forests, saying over-pumping the aquifer that provides water to homes and businesses dries out soil and increases wildfire risks. <br/>'We should be limiting public access in those high-risk areas too, or we're going to end up having more and more fires \u2014 and they're going to get worse as the planet and our climate get warmer and our ground gets drier,' Tittel said. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseymonitor.com/subscribe\">https://newjerseymonitor.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nj.gov/njoem/mitigation/pdf/2019/mit2019_section5-12_Wildfire.pdf\">https://nj.gov/njoem/mitigation/pdf/2019/mit2019_section5-12_Wildfire.pdf</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A1392/bill-text?f=A1500&amp;n=1392_I1\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A1392/bill-text?f=A1500&amp;n=1392_I1</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A2632/bill-text?f=A3000&amp;n=2632_I1\">https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A2632/bill-text?f=A3000&amp;n=2632_I1</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Sometimes it is not that simple. Jarvis Tucker is a senior at Hazelwood Central High in St. Louis, Missouri. He plays football, he is the star defensive tackle on the team and he ranked in the top 10 amongst all defensive tackles in the country. Jarvis has all you could ask for as a 17 year old teenager: a great support system for family and friends. One of his greatest supporters is his best friend Montavious Jackson. Montavious does not play any sports like Jarvis but he and Jarvis have been friends since they were three years old. Their friendship is a bond that couldn't be broken by anyone, or so they thought.</p><p>Jarvis has a crush on a girl named Kayla Hollins. Kayla is a senior at Hazelwood Central, along with Jarvis. They have been going to school together since the second grade. Ever since then, Jarvis has not been able to get Kayla off of his mind. Now, Kayla knows that Jarvis likes her because he gives her sly stares and looks away quickly when their eyes meet. Kayla finds this endearing because she likes him---she just wants him to come over and break the ice between them. In Jarvis' head he hears a line from the 90s R&amp;B group Jodeci. The line says, \"Come and talk to me, I really wanna meet you girl.\" Both Jarvis and Kayla want the same thing--for the other to initiate a conversation.\u00a0</p><p>On the other hand, Montavious is always telling him not to be stuck on her because there are other fish in the sea. Jarvis suspects that Montavious is jealous but he can't be sure. Jarvis starts to build up the courage to talk to Kayla and walks up to her. As soon as he gets within a close speaking distance, he trips on his feet and bumps into Kayla. Kayla finds this amusing, and she became a little excited when he brushed up against her, but she tried to play it cool. She asks if he is okay and they both straighten themselves up. Jarvis finally asks her out on a date and Kayla says yes. This is the happiest day of both of their lives up to this point. Eventually, Jarvis and Kayla started dating and are doing very well in their relationship. But Montavious is not happy about not one bit.</p><p>Montavious feels that Jarvis doesn't hang out with him anymore. They don't play video games, go play a pick up game of basketball, etc. ever since Kayla came into the picture. Jarvis is in love and he doesn't see a problem at all. Montavious is jealous because he doesn't have a girlfriend and now his best friend has abandoned him. Jealousy had Montavious in its firm grasp and wouldn't let him go. This caused him to tell Kayla that Jarvis was cheating on him with Sarah, his female friend. Montavious hoped that this would break them up and he would get his friend back. Instead, this backfired on him. In the ensuing drama, everybody eventually figured out that Montavious was lying all along. Kayla, Jarvis, and Sarah confronted Montavious afterschool.\u00a0 Montavious was sweating and felt his body get hotter.

Not little Smokey Bear warning \"only you can prevent forest fires.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How about a cow?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The big burns of this September have been primarily in rangeland. When grasslands and sagebrush burn, it can be as explosive as a forest fire. Gov. Jay Inslee claimed in his Sept. 15 wildfire press briefing \"there's really no management you can do over tens of thousands of acres of grass and sagebrush. You just can't get out your lawn mower and mow that grass,\"Inslee said. He blamed climate change. \"The solution is to prevent that grass from becoming like gasoline - the aridity dries it out and it becomes explosive.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Livestock producers listening to the livestream collectively groaned on social media. \"Living in and representing areas that are high-risk for fire, I don't have 80 years to change the climate a degree or two, we need results now,\" said Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda. \"We have all kinds of treatments in our forests that can have results. And it's the same with the grasslands.\"</p><p>That's where cattle come in. Self-propelled, bio-fueled mowers are a solution in both forests and rangeland. Or maybe you'd rather have a cute lamb as the mascot for grazing as a tool for fire mitigation. Large flocks used to roam fields and forests in Washington, particularly useful in removing vegetation from the forest floor.</p><p>In the teeth of the unusually heavy winds on Labor Day, no logging or grazing would stop fire. Dr. Crystal Raymond, Climate Adaptation Specialist at Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, said the link between climate change and wind is unclear, but good management practices can reduce the climate impact. \"Doing something that will reduce fuel buildup will make a difference,\" Raymond said.</p><p>Mitigating wildfire spread is the most direct way to reduce Washington's carbon footprint.A 2015 legislative report says wildfire represents from 13% to 50% of Washington's total carbon emissions per year, depending on fire activity.</p><p>Carbon critic or not, everyone was miserable after a week of smoky skies. The 2020 Labor Day wildfires were nowhere near the scale of the 1910 Big Burn, generating smoke for weeks, blackening skies from Denver to Saskatchewan and reaching the East Coast. The Big Burn shaped U.S. attitudes toward forest fire suppression for generations. It took decades of scientific inquiry before rediscovering the role fire plays in a healthy forest. And there are still those who see all proposed logging as a mindless attempt to hammer the forest.</p><p>Reducing ladder fuels using mechanical methods or grazing is a best practice for firewise forest landscapes. We're continuing to learn about application to rangelands. In a 2016 issue of The International Journal of Wildland Fire, a study of winter grazing as treatment for fuel management concluded it \"can be applied across vast shrub-grasslands to decrease wildfire risk and fire intensity to mediate climate change effects on wildfire activity.\"</p><p>Intensively managing millions of acres is unrealistic, but targeted treatment works. Kretz has seen coordinated forest management between different agencies and multiple private owners be effective in Okanogan County, creating corridors of defensible space for crews and equipment. It's a safer alternative for firefighters and the environment than blasting a bulldozer line in the face of wind-driven flames.</p><p>\"We have conceded huge swaths of forest between big rivers and highways when we need to concentrate on creating corridors of protection,\" Kretz said.</p><p>Fighting wildfire safely is a concern for Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz. She supports the concept of pre-planned firebreaks maintained by thinning and grazing.</p><p>\"We are working on scheduling a meeting at the end of October to better understand the challenges of managing fire on rangeland and ag lands,\" Franz said.</p><p>Researchers with the University of California Cooperative Extension dug into the link between cows and fire in California, affirming the positive impact of grazing to reduce fuel load and make fire suppression safer. When cows eat the grass before it dries out, the flame front stays lower, and the carbon goes back into the soil instead of into the air.</p><p>Climate is changing. Successful climate adaptation means the management of our forests and rangelands must follow the science.</p><p>The phrase \"log it, graze it or watch it burn\" applies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-37861283</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YP-W8X1-JC0C-J01R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

When people hear that only 1 in 10 Philly cops and fewer than one-quarter of firefighters have submitted proof that they are vaccinated, some immediately say we should force people to choose between getting the shot and keeping their jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But perhaps it is not too late to tap the brakes on all that a mandate implies. Could it be that mandates themselves are partly to blame for the resistance they provoke? There is something visceral in the response that we cannot be compelled to put anything into our bodies against our own will. Is freedom of choice not at the heart of many of our long-simmering social battles? Vaccine mandates can generate a similar refusal to yield control over our destinies. In the end you're not sticking something into my arm. You're sticking it into me.</p><p>Official directives, with all the not-so-subtle monopoly of force government wields, are not to be taken lightly. It is one thing for me to volunteer, to request the protection of a shot (which I have received), but to be compelled is a far different matter. The government no longer views me as a person, with all the expectation of self-determination entailed. Instead it treats me as a piece of meat to be injected.</p><p>Roughly 30% of Philadelphia residents aged 12 and up have not been vaccinated. Even if the number of resisters were smaller than it currently is, would we be justified in riding roughshod over their concerns? To do so is to declare that interior freedom no longer counts. Of course there are times when public safety requires just such summary dismissal. To save all or a greater number it may be that some have to be, if not sacrificed, at least not taken into account. But is this what is happening in the vaccine mandate controversy? We may think that the hesitant are more in danger from disease than from the vaccine, but is it so implausible that they might perceive the danger in opposite terms? Many come from the ranks of those who fought heroically on the front lines of the pandemic, such as nurses, police, and firefighters, so I'm bound to feel uneasy about dismissing their perspective. Can we so lightly ignore their reservations?</p><p>The public interest in conquering COVID-19 has induced us to accept trade-offs we would not normally endure. We supported lockdowns and restrictions that in retrospect had higher costs than foreseen, but we put up with them as temporary. When a forest fire is raging, you obey the authorities who prohibit you from the vicinity. But now something more than a trade-off is at stake. We are not asking for a temporary surrender of liberty, an inconvenience, but a permanent submission to an order with which one deeply disagrees. This is not like paying a fine. It is an irrevocable loss of autonomy for those affected.</p><p>We cannot overlook the rights of some without jeopardizing the rights of all and demonstrating that, under certain conditions, we are prepared to set aside our deepest convictions. Under the vaccine mandates, we are declaring that the views of our fellow citizens, at least in this case, do not count. Sailors on an aircraft carrier may have to submit to a preemption of their autonomy, but citizens of a free society should be able to find another way.</p><p>David Walsh, professor of politics at the</p><p>Catholic University of America, is author of \"The Priority of the Person\" (Notre Dame, 2020).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIINQ-PHQP20211114Ar06502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIINQ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:642Y-9931-DYJT-2193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Inquirer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 14, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000303</classCode><className>CIVIL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

Canadian politicians across all levels of government are not aligned on what started the fires and what needs to be done to combat them, a discord that is fuelling a deep misunderstanding of this intense and destructive climate moment. <br/>There is real fear, in Alberta and beyond, about what these fires represent. They are burning during a critical time for climate policy discussions that will have an enormous impact across Canada, particularly in the oil and gas heartland. <br/>Alberta Premier Danielle Smith blamed ongoing wildfires across the province on arsonists, perpetuating a concerning misunderstanding of how forest fires start and spread. Photo: Chris Schwarz / Government of Alberta <br/>Hardly anyone in the country is unaffected. There is a direct and visceral threat to home and security for the tens of thousands who have been forced to flee. Then there's a fear of job loss and security for those who work in sectors including oil and gas. Not to mention the physical and emotional stress on firefighters forced to work without adequate resources or funding[6]. <br/>Millions more Canadians have been trapped under smoky skies caused by fires thousands of kilometres away. <br/>Everyone is carrying the anxiety of a changing planet. <br/>The discussions that need to happen now \u2014 that should've started long ago \u2014 are complex and wide-ranging, and the solutions they result in will require unprecedented co-ordination across ideologies. Along with better approaches to fire prevention and management, governments need to cope with misinformation and social media companies that allow it to spread. <br/>Given all of that, space lasers can seem like an easy out. <br/>Here's a rundown of what we know about how the wildfires actually started and the truth behind the most prominent conspiracy theories. It's also a look at who benefits from spreading untruths and what politicians and social media platforms could be doing to stop the climate disinformation blazing across the country. <br/>Alberta is the province most impacted by wildfires this year: 108 forest fires burned in May, including this blaze west of Fox Creek. Photo: Kyle Brittain <br/>Just how on fire is Canada right now? <br/>Natural disasters at their worst seem cinematic and fictional. And this year, for the first time in our collective memory, the entire country was very much on fire. <br/>Since March, 11 provinces and territories have been affected by thousands of forest fires, many of them out of control. Canada is witnessing its 'worst wildfire season' in recorded history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in early June. You could see the fires from coast to coast[7]. <br/>British Columbia saw the second single-largest wildfire in its history this year in Donnie Creek[8]. Alberta was the most impacted overall, with 108 forest fires in May, forcing the government to declare[9] a provincial state of emergency that lasted a month. Almost 40 per cent of the country's fires were in Quebec, threatening to evacuate more than 15,000 people. Newfoundland and Labrador saw 34 wildfires before May 1, compared to only two fires in the same period last year. Nova Scotia saw its largest recorded forest fire in history; 16,000 residents were evacuated from the Halifax area. <br/>The sheer cumulative effect was, well, apocalyptic. A wall of smoke descended across the U.S.-Canada border. New York City experienced its worst air quality since a dramatic smog event in the 1960s. Skies turned orange, horizons and skylines disappeared. <br/>North America has never experienced fire like this before. It is scary and visceral. In Ottawa, the smoke became the perfectly haunting metaphor: parliamentarians and policymakers were trapped in the heavy fog, unable to act or see ahead. <br/>And it's not over: while British Columbia is bracing for intense thunderstorms, the large Donnie Creek fire is expected to keep burning[10] for several weeks. <br/>British Columbia saw the second single-largest wildfire in its history this year in Donnie Creek. Photos: B.C. Wildfire Service <br/>How did the 2023 Canadian wildfires start? <br/>The majority of the forest fires still burning in Canada are caused[11] by lightning, Mother Nature's energy weapon that literally sparks flames. <br/>In any given year, almost half of the fires that burn across the country are started by lightning, but those fires account for nearly 67 per cent of the land burned, according to the federal government[12]. There have been 2,536 wildfires[13] across Canada already this year. <br/>But a strike of lightning will not turn into a catastrophic wildfire unless the conditions are ripe for one. <br/>In dry, hot conditions, the flames become raging blazes and if the wind picks up, it carries the thick smoke quickly. Such conditions will become the norm for longer periods of time as Earth's atmosphere warms rapidly due to carbon pollution created from burning fossil fuels. Wildfire seasons will start earlier, last longer and be more intense[14]. <br/>As of this week, almost five million hectares of land in Canada have burned[13]. That's more than the amount of land that burned in 2016, 2019, 2020 and 2022 combined. <br/>Members of the Canadian Armed Forces, Alberta Wildfire and local firefighters try to contain a fire in Drayton Valley, Alta., in May 2023. Photo: Master Corporal Genevieve Lapointe / Canadian Armed Forces  <br/>Lightning strikes have an outsized impact, according to Natural Resources Canada, because they can occur in remote, less populated areas and the fires are often left to burn. Or they can happen in clusters, with multiple fires lit at once, forcing firefighters to decide which ones to tackle with limited resources. <br/>Humans do cause the majority of wildfires, just over half, but they tend not to be part of a balaclava-clad crowd of ne'er do wells and extremists.  <br/>Recent figures released by the B.C. Wildfire Service show a third of this year's 444 wildfires were caused by lightning. Another 263 were attributed to suspected human activity, not arson but carelessness, like 'vehicle and engine use, industrial activity, fireworks, sky-lanterns, outdoor flame lighting and discarding burning items (e.g. cigarettes).' That doesn't mean there hasn't been a history[15] of trying to blame everyone from Antifa to environmentalists for the conflagrations. <br/>Alberta's June 13 update on the wildfire situation showed 368 of 634 \u201458 per cent \u2014 wildfires this year were human caused, which the province says covers 'everything from recreational fires to agricultural incidents to wildfires caused by people on residential land.' It's part of the reason Alberta implemented bans on outdoor fires and all-terrain vehicle use through much of the spring. <br/>Almost 60 per cent of the wildfires in Alberta this year, like this one near Fox Creek in May, were human caused, part of the reason the province implemented bans on outdoor fires and all-terrain vehicle use through much of the spring. Photo: Kyle Brittain <br/>During a news conference on June 12, \u200b\u200bMelissa Story, an information officer with Alberta Wildfire, said the service is also seeing an 'emerging trend with fireworks and exploding targets.' <br/>Lightning, according to the province, was responsible for 129 fires and another 135 are under investigation. <br/>And yes, sometimes arson is the cause. <br/>In Alberta, RCMP charged a man[16] in May for a series of arsons, including what they say were intentionally set wildfires, in 2022. The man was also charged with breaching conditions for a previous charge that was supposed to confine him to his property. There was no mention by police of climate motivations for the fires he set, which also included a church, post office and rodeo grounds among targets. That same year, a woman from Kamloops, B.C., was also charged[17] with wildfire arsons. She pled guilty and has yet to be sentenced. <br/>'We see arson wildfires every year, in one form or another. Sometimes they're under-represented, sometimes they're over,' Story with Alberta Wildfire told The Toronto Star[18] on June 8. 'It's not an emerging trend that we're concerned about right now.' <br/>Arson happens, but it is rare. <br/>So why are arsonist theories so widespread? <br/>There's a certain logic to trying to distract from the terror of wildfires and the changing climate that helps set the conditions for them. For many individuals, perhaps the truth is so unimaginable, unsettling and unavoidable, they refuse to accept the complex origins of the new reality. <br/>Others have more nefarious motivations and use positions of influence to shore up their own interests \u2014 from business leaders to politicians to influencers. <br/>Often, misinformation takes a piece of truth and twists it. Last week, the B.C. Wildfire Service released a video[19] explaining how it uses planned ignitions \u2014 a fire management tactic that strategically burns areas of the forest a fire hasn't reached as a way to contain it. But in a doctored version of the video going viral online, footage from the service is edited so all you see is a yellow helicopter flying above a smoke-filled forest in Donnie Creek, in the northeastern part of the province, with a torch suspended from one of the wings shooting flames into the trees. The words 'it was a setup' flash on the screen.  <br/>Some of the theories show how new crises are absorbed into existing disinformation spheres. As politicians and health officials advised people to stay indoors or wear masks outside, it activated people who felt COVID-19 lockdowns had curtailed their freedoms \u2014 and ignored that N95 masks prevent both the spread of viruses and inhalation of harmful smoke. Then there are those who believe the wildfires were intentionally set to destroy rural life and force everyone into 15-minute cities \u2014 an urban planning concept in which daily life exists within walking or biking distance. And there's the long-running classic, that the wildfires are purposely lit to give the Trudeau government cover to increase the carbon price, which is one of the most effective tools to reduce industrial emissions. <br/>Donnie Creek Wildfire - Planned igntions update June 2, 2023[20] A doctored video of this one released by the B.C. Wildfire Service has been used to spread conspiracy theories about how this year's fires started in the province.  <br/>'Climate is just the latest victim in a trend that has already claimed conversations around public health, conversations around migration, conversations around sexual and reproductive health rights, conversations around LGBTQ rights [and] conversations around racial justice,' Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told The Narwhal. <br/>'The kind of underlying unifying theme is one of the so-called woke agenda and the cabal of internationalists or globalists who are instigating that supposed agenda,' said King, whose organization is an international think-tank that researches threats to democracy, including disinformation. 'That can then be applied to any topic.' <br/>That's probably why the list of conspiracy theories is endless. There are varying (untrue) explanations of how arsonists operate, from stealing ammonium nitrate from a train to a more elaborate theory about eco-terrorists who co-ordinated the lighting of matches at the same time across the country. <br/>None of these assertions are new this year, or to Canada \u2014 similar theories have been floated globally, as fires increase and intensify. But their veracity is deeply concerning, not only because of the growing risk of wildfire, but because of the threat disinformation poses to broader climate action. <br/>In June, Kingston, Ont., was blanketed in smoke due to wildfires in northern Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Photo: Lars Hagberg / The Canadian Press  <br/>What leads people to believe climate misinformation? <br/>Studies have shown[21] increased anxiety and feeling a loss of control can contribute to belief in conspiracy theories. If anxiety is increased, so too is a disposition to justify theories outside the realm of reality. <br/>Education or intelligence don't factor in, at least not in the way many would snidely suggest. One study[22] from Yale Law School in 2017 showed people with higher abilities to interpret quantitative information were better at contorting facts to fit their ideological bias.  <br/>Adrian Bardon, a philosophy professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina and author of The Truth About Denial, calls this[23] 'toxic, system-justifying identity politics.' <br/>Humans are hardwired for a certain amount of bias and self-justification. Bardon says we often have reactions and then we find reasons to justify those reactions, not the other way around. <br/>Existential threats \u2014 whether it's the world burning or the loss of your paycheque \u2014 are powerful drivers of fear and conspiracy. Powerlessness in the face of global forces is visceral. <br/>But there is also some calculation at play among the top spreaders of climate disinformation, with influencers, grifters and politicians leading the herd away from climate and toward, say, arsonists. <br/>When it comes to climate change, the age of denialism is largely over, according to a report[24] from King's Institute for Strategic Dialogues. What has taken its place are strategies to muddy the discursive waters, particularly from polluting industries and those with vested interests. <br/>'Whether through conspiracies like 'climate lockdown,' or by conflating climate with divisive issues like critical race theory, LGBTQ+ rights and abortion access, the goal of much climate change [misinformation] now is to distract and delay,' reads the report. <br/>'Yet, with the window to act deemed 'brief and rapidly closing,' such an approach may prove fatal.' <br/>Almost 40 per cent of Canada's 2023 wildfires have been in Quebec, threatening to evacuate more than 15,000 people. Photo: Socit de protection des forts contre le feu  <br/>So what are Canadian politicians saying about wildfires? <br/>When fire season started this year, Alberta politicians were in the midst of an election campaign devoid of serious climate talk[25] even as the province burned \u2014 shrouding cities in smoke and forcing the evacuation of homes and oil facilities. <br/>It didn't take long for evidence-free theories to start spreading: the idea that shadowy NDP operatives, perhaps working in concert with Trudeau, intentionally set the fires in order to help defeat the UCP. In reality, the UCP slashed the budgets for wildfire suppression in 2019, leaving a 'skeleton crew[6]' to tackle this year's infernos. <br/>There's been a lot of finger pointing and climate denial as this year's fires reached record levels, across the country and all levels of government. <br/>Federal Environment Minister Stephen Guilbeault said his ability to act on wildfires was limited by political differences. 'What would greatly help our capacity to accelerate our fight against climate change in Canada is if I didn't have to fight with certain jurisdictions all the time on doing the bare minimum to fight climate change, if I wouldn't have to fight the Conservative Party of Canada,' he told[26] CTV News. <br/>Meanwhile at Queen's Park in the heart of Toronto \u2014 which had the second-worst air quality in the world at one point last week due to fires in northern Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec \u2014 Premier Doug Ford refused to link the wildfire smoke to climate change. When asked[27] about it by Ontario NDP leader Marit Stiles, he accused the opposition of 'politicizing the fires.' <br/>Instead, Ford touted the work of Ontario's firefighters while failing to mention or justify his government's decision to cut 67 per cent of his province's emergency forest firefighting funds in the 2019 budget. Ford's Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry Graydon Smith matter-of-factly said[28] 'we've got forest fires every year in Ontario' as schools across the Greater Toronto Area cancelled recess due to smoke. <br/>Then, on the last day of the legislature's summer session, Ford declared Ontario's economy 'is on fire,' making a badly timed pun as 54 forest fires engulfed the province in smoke.  <br/>In June, as wildfire smoke made Toronto's air quality the second worst in the world, Ontario Premier Doug Ford refused to acknowledge the links to climate change or need for climate action in the legislature. Photo: Carlos Osorio / The Narwhal <br/>Why aren't social media companies stopping the spread of wildfire conspiracy theories? <br/>Probably because it helps them make money. <br/>According to a report[29] by the Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition published earlier this year, fossil fuel companies spent around US$4 million on Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) for paid advertisements that spread false or misleading claims on climate issues. <br/>The findings show 'a stark comeback for climate denial' and 'negligence from Big Tech companies who not only continue to monetize and enable, but in some cases actively recommend, such content to users,' the report says. <br/>Big Tech's failure to crack down on climate misinformation has been cited as a serious obstacle in reaching global climate goals. In November 2021, more than 400 organizations and individuals wrote an open letter[30] demanding global action to tackle climate misinformation and disinformation. <br/>Since March, 11 provinces and territories have been affected by thousands of forest fires, including Quebec. Canada is witnessing its 'worst wildfire season' in recorded history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in early June. Photo: Socit de protection des forts contre le feu  <br/>There has been some progress. In October 2021, Google announced[31] it would 'prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.' In April 2022, Pinterest announced a policy to reduce climate change disinformation in content and ads. And ahead of Earth Day this year, TikTok amended[32] its policies to require the removal of any content that 'undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it.' <br/>On Earth Day last year, Twitter also announced[33] a new policy to demonetize climate denial in its advertising, although that hasn't lasted. Since July 2022, when Elon Musk took over the platform, the Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition has observed an increase in climate denial content on Twitter. The group noted a concerning spike for #ClimateScam, a hashtag that 'soared back up the top search results' on the site last week, according to King's early analysis. 'That was obviously linked to the stories around the wildfires,' she said. <br/>There's more work to be done, as the online discourse around this year's wildfires makes clear. Canada is expected to introduce wide-ranging policy around online harms later this year, after two and a half years of discussion, and King said it can't come too soon. <br/>'Canada is probably a little late to the party in recognizing the threat of climate, mis- and disinformation, both at a low local policymaking level, but also, the broader trend of climate being weaponized within kind of identity politics, and dynamics of, of cultural discourse,' she said. There's finally a recognition that climate disinformation carries 'a real vector of harm,' she said, that is creating confusion and perpetuating inaction. <br/>Firefighters battle a grass fire in Kamloops, B.C., in June 2023. Already, 20,000 Canadians have been displaced by this year's wildfires. Photo: Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press  <br/>So why should you care? <br/>There are a lot of climate policies taking shape in Ottawa, from clean electricity regulations, to new clean fuel standards, increased carbon prices and potential caps on emissions from the oil and gas sector. The federal government is ramping up efforts to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 after years of dithering as emissions rose. <br/>It's essential these policies are discussed and debated on a level playing field, not one distorted by misinformation, so Canadians feel the measures are being passed in their best interests. Especially given the profound impacts of a changing economy, in a world that's clearly changing despite warnings that were shrugged off. <br/>Wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will increase floods and fire. Already, 20,000 Canadians have been displaced by this year's wildfires. Many more will have to leave their homes behind as shorelines and floodplains shift and forests and grasslands burn. Managed retreat[34] and its incalculable costs will challenge governments across the country. <br/>It's a huge problem \u2014 the existential challenge of our times. The urge to turn it into a fantastical but simple tale that has a beginning, middle and end, an obvious villain and a clear-cut spark is understandable.

It was just the latest blaze in a summer of wildfires that have swept across the Mediterranean region, leaving areas in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Algeria and Spain in smoldering ruins. The wildfire started yesterday evening, in the height of France's summer vacation season, about 24 miles inland from the coastal resort of Saint-Tropez. </p><p>Fueled by powerful seasonal winds coming off the Mediterranean Sea, the fire had spread across 12,000 acres of forest by this morning, according to the Var regional administration. Some 6,000 people were evacuated from homes and a dozen campgrounds in the region prized by vacationers, while others were locked down in a holiday center for Air France employees. At least 22 people suffered from smoke inhalation or minor fire-related injuries, Var's top government official told broadcaster France Bleu. Two firefighters were among the injured. Water-dumping planes and emergency helicopters zipped back and forth over hills lined with chestnut, pine and oak trees. Images shared online by firefighters showed black plumes of smoke leaping across thickets of trees as the flames darted across dry brush. One evacuee told France-Bleu that smoke enveloped his car as he returned to his campsite and he had just enough time to grab his baby daughter's milk and basic belongings before fleeing. Another told BFM television about escaping as his hotel caught fire. Backed by planes and helicopters, more than 900 firefighters worked today to contain the blaze, civil security service spokesperson Alexandre Jouassard said. Local authorities closed roads, blocked access to forests across the region and urged caution. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been vacationing in a nearby coastal fortress, was to visit the fire zone later today. The regional administration warned that fire risk would remain very high through tomorrow because of hot, dry weather. Temperatures in the area have reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit in recent days. Intense heat and wildfires have also struck countries around southern Europe and North Africa in recent weeks, with fires killing at least 75 people in Algeria and 16 in Turkey. In Greece today, hundreds of firefighters backed by water-dropping planes were battling a large forest fire that has led to the evacuation of a care home and several villages northwest of Athens. Hundreds of wildfires have burned across Greece this month, fueled by the country's longest and most severe heat wave in decades that left its forests and shrubland bone dry. Italy has also seen several fire-related deaths. Also today, Israeli firefighters worked for a third consecutive day to contain a wildfire that has consumed a large swath of forest west of Jerusalem and threatened several communities. Worsening drought and heat - linked to climate change - have also fueled wildfires this summer in the western United States and in Russia's northern Siberia region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b5441d185a97b7f5f18630000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M0-HNV1-JBSK-R0MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 17, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Unlike raging wildfires that have burned vast swaths of the drought-stricken U.S. West this summer, the blazes in Sequoia National Park were not explosive. </p><p>Flames were about a mile from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada. \"It's been slow growth,\" fire information officer Katy Hooper said. Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames. Firefighters have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet, as well as some other trees and buildings. The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames. A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns \u2014 fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes \u2014 and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants. A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. \"This is a beautiful, open, parklike forest,\" fire spokesman Mark Garrett said. But a historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles. The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles. More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said. To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees. Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month. Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march. Containment there has reached 71%. Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West. Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend. The rain was not expected to come as far south as Sequoia National Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001305613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N7-CCP1-DY6F-J0PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 18, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS144</classCode><className>NEVADA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Flames were about a mile from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\"It's been slow growth,\" fire information officer Katy Hooper said.</p><p>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.</p><p>Firefighters have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet, as well as some other trees and buildings.</p><p>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.</p><p>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns - fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes - and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.</p><p>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\"This is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\" fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.</p><p>But a historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles. The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles.</p><p>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.</p><p>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.</p><p>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.</p><p>Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march.</p><p>Containment there has reached 71%.</p><p>Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West.</p><p>Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend.

And I got to the point where I even went to see the guy who shot and killed my mom, because that's how confident that I was in myself. And I wanted to come out and share that counselor is important. We need to help each other.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN HOST: Wow. Well, that that then reminds me of the moment in your film, Isaac about the young man, you know, saying he feeling the courage in that moment where he wanted to reach out to his dad after for so many years, you know, feeling abandoned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish we could talk more about it. We've got breaking news, Issac Ingram work done, really fantastic connecting with you. And congratulations on a really inspiring, enriching and powerful film. Hey, thanks so much.</p><p>ISSAC INGRAM, DIRECTOR: Hey, just want to tell everybody.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes.</p><p>INGRAM: If you want to see the film, go to truefreedomfilm.com and sign up for the screener. And it'll it'll have the screener there, as well as CVS health, Aetna, they gave us a facilitators guide. So if you wanted to facilitate it in your mentoring program, truefreedomfilm.com. That's where you can go and download the film and watch it. So thank you so much, Fredricka. Really appreciate this.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Perfect making it available. That's the key. Thank you so much to both of you, gentlemen. Appreciate it. Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAM: Bye-bye.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me in Washington, DC. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And first on CNN, we're following a major new development in what could soon be Donald Trump's fourth indictment. Just a short time ago today I spoke with former Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor and Geoff Duncan, who told me that he will testify in the next 48 hours before grand jury in Atlanta. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.</p><p>And we also now know that an independent journalist has tweeted today that he was also called by the Fulton County District Attorney, and also was asked to testify before that grand jury on Tuesday. Geoff Duncan is now a CNN political commentator.</p><p>And this is his entire interview with me earlier today as Duncan talks about this subpoena and his plans to testify.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So have you received that notice that would come from their office a 48 hour notice to testify?</p><p>GEOFF DUNCAN (R) FORMER LT. GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: Frederick, I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury, and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting facts.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK. You were one of 70 people who testified last year before grand jury. Is it your expectation that on Tuesday, when you're asked questions, again that they will be similar? Or do you expect? Or are you preparing yourself for new questions and a broadening of the investigation?</p><p>DUNCAN: Well, I have no expectations as to the questions. And I'll certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation.</p><p>But look, for me, this is a story that is important for Republicans, to hear Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him. We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful. And he's got a chance to present these facts and say, Hey, I didn't know what was going on or I think what's what reality is going to be as they knew exactly what they were doing.</p><p>And I think the interesting part to this indictment that's different than the others is that there's going to heavy signaling that there's going to be well plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had to Donald Trump when he was trying to to change the election outcome in 2020. And so it's gonna be interesting to see which way they go.</p><p>And you know, these are serious charges that are being signaled racketeering, conspiracy, RICO. I mean, these are things really, you know, kind of garnered for the the mafia or the mob. And so what we'll certainly see, this gets ratcheted up in the next few days. WHITFIELD: Well, tell me more about that people who you believe once were very loyal to Trump now, as a result of the investigation and the ongoing investigation no longer have the same kind of loyalties. How do you believe that may have changed the building of this case against Trump?</p><p>DUNCAN: Yes, I think a number of people arrived on Donald Trump's conspiracy team from a number of different angles. Some folks got there, because the sitting president, the head of their party told them it was true. And so they just believed it. Word for word.</p><p>Others got there because they saw an opportunity to be in the cool kids club for the first time to hang out tight to the inner circle of a president and lots of things in between those two elements. So that -- that's going to be the part that plays out here. I mean, there are currently elected folks that are rumored to be indicted.</p><p>[15:05:00]</p><p>There are formerly elected folks party leads, successful business owner. I mean, this is a wide swath of Georgia, or representatives of Georgia that are going to have to face the consequences of answering some very, very tough questions.</p><p>But the reality is, I've yet to see a single ounce of proof that the election was not fair and legal didn't turn out the way Republicans wanted to. But it was fair and legal here in Georgia, and quite honestly, the rest of the country.</p><p>But this is an important part for the Republican Party to face, right. If we're going to truly turn and look forward, if we're going to turn -- surely turn the page for GOP 2.0, we've got to have Donald Trump the rearview mirror and the uncomfortable facts and figures of what he did during the post-election 2020 period of time, he is going to be part of that healing process for the Republican Party. It's necessary, but it's going to be painful.</p><p>WHITFIELD: How immediately did your loyalties to Trump as the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, as a Republican, when and how, and under what circumstances did that change where you are no longer on board with the former president.</p><p>DUNCAN: So it's interesting, it actually started this is the first chapter of my book that I wrote about a rally two days before the election in Rome, Georgia. I gave an opening intro remarks before President Trump got -- I got on stage. And I made a couple of comments. I said every time we lower people's taxes, it's not just for Republicans, it's for Democrats, too. And I got booed by 30,000 MAGA hats.</p><p>And then I said, every time we improve education, it's not just for Democrats, it's for Republicans, and I got booed even louder. And then I made this this crazy statement and said, you know, our policies are so good. They even help the people that don't vote for us and I got booed even louder. It was at that moment that I realized that that crew of 30,000 people were not conservative, they were angry. And within hours of the 2020 election, when I started hearing Donald Trump talk about his notion that the election was rigged, and the machines were corrupt and whatever else conspiracy theories, I quickly turned the page and I tried to get to it as quickly as I could, so that I could try to stop the the little grass fire from turning into a forest fire, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful.</p><p>There wasn't enough of us out there doing it. But instead, we're gonna have this slow, painful process of realizing what the truth actually is. And that's Donald Trump ran the worst campaign ever. And if we let him be our nominee again, he will get beat by Joe Biden again because it will be the worst campaign a Republican could ever put forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Again, the breaking news here, the former Lieutenant Governor, Geoff Duncan of Georgia has been called to appear before a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury. He said he will be there on Tuesday. With me now to discuss these developments is Renato Marriott a he is a former federal prosecutor. Also back with us is CNN's Marshall Cohen. Marshall to you first, tell us more about the significance of this announcement by Duncan, that he will testify in the coming days before the grand jury.</p><p>MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: Fredricka, it's happening. It's finally here. There have been so much speculation and preparation and security measures and grand juries and rulings and motions and litigation. It's finally here with these notifications going out to Geoff Duncan and another member of the potential -- another person who is going to testify to the grand jury with these notifications.</p><p>It is clear that Fani Willis is moving forward. This is her big moment to give this presentation to the grand jury probably expect it to begin on Monday could spill into Tuesday, where she is expected as CNN has been reporting for a while to seek indictments against Donald Trump and many of his Republican allies in Georgia, possibly more than a dozen defendants.</p><p>We are talking very serious felony charges possibly on the table like conspiracy and racketeering RICO, which Fani Willis has a lot of experience with it as a prosecutor in Atlanta. So the notifications going out today really are the starting gun have the final stretch of this investigation. Fredricka.</p><p>WHITFIELD: OK. You said notifications going out today. So we know Geoff Duncan, we understand that another witness who is an independent journalist, what can you tell us about that person? And does that mean they're more even more after that?</p><p>COHEN: There very well could be more you broke the story on your show here with Geoff Duncan. And in the wake of that shortly after that, the independent journalist George Chidi, who is an Atlanta based journalist, he tweeted out that he had been asked to appear on Tuesday as well. We previously reported that he was subpoenaed, and now he is announcing that the date of that appearance will be like Lieutenant Governor Duncan on Tuesday. And this is an interesting figure George Chidi because he actually was a witness in 2020, December 2020 to the fake electors, the fake pro-Trump electors meeting in the state house in Atlanta in December 2020 as part of that Trump backed scheme to to subvert the electoral college process.</p><p>[15:10:00]</p><p>So that might be a clue of one of the things that the grand jurors are going to hear. That is one of the many prongs of this investigation, the fake electoral scheme, so many other elements. But it will all come to a head, presumably in the next few days.</p><p>WHITFIELD: These notifications going out to witnesses to appear before the grand jury happening, you're simultaneous to the former president making campaign stops there in Iowa at the Iowa State Fair today. That was the the video that you were seeing just a moment ago.</p><p>So Renato, what is this mean that you would have some witnesses called to testify before the grand jury this week. And these are witnesses that have already testified in the past, and now being brought back what does it say about where the case is?</p><p>RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, it says that we are on mile 25 of the marathon so to speak. We are basically close to the end, as Marshall mentioned, Fred. This now is a grand jury, a charging grand jury, a grand jury that can return an indictment, and Fani Willis and her team are putting their evidence into that grand jury so that ultimately, they can ask in the very near future, whether it's this week or next asked for the fourth indictment of Donald Trump and perhaps the first of some of his, you know, co-conspirators or co- schemers.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then Renato, does a DA pick a witness to testify again, reveal something new about information. Is it to clarify? Or is it to perhaps underscore something that's already been discovered?</p><p>MARIOTTI: So well, it's a couple of things. First of all, the information needs to get from the special grand jury into the new one, instead of reading the testimony, in other words, you could have someone just read the transcript of what happened before the special grand jury, it's obviously more powerful if it's presented in person. They can ask some additional questions, put some, you know, for example, new things that they've learned over the course of their investigation.</p><p>But ultimately, the main purpose here is to take the information they already have. I don't think there's going to be any big surprises about what for example, the lieutenant governor is going to say, since they've already spoken to him. But they're going to put that all in front of this grand jury. So the grand jury has an opportunity to see these witnesses see the evidence, and this way that the district attorney can make sure that the grand jury is going to return the indictment that she puts before them.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And Renato, you know, this case is different than the other three indictments of Trump in that. This is a state case and won't involve federal charges. And last hour, when I was talking to election attorney Ben Ginsberg, he reminded us all that, you know, state cases, if Trump were to be reelected, he would be unable to pardon himself. What else is significant about the types of charges the Fulton County prosecutor is considering?</p><p>MARIOTTI: A few things and not only would he not be able to pardon himself, but the pardon process in Georgia means the Governor Kemp would not be able to pardon him either. There's a pardon board. So it's a more complicated process.</p><p>He also would not be able to shut down the investigation in the same way. In other words, Trump could try to make some argument to courts in Georgia that, as president, he can't be subject to a state indictment. But if he, you know, was president of United States, he could order if the attorney general install an attorney general, something like Jeffrey Clark, who could literally shut down Jack Smith's investigations. You can't do that to Fanni Willis. She's an elected official, you know, in the state of Georgia.</p><p>But separate and apart from that, Fred, you know, unlike the other state charge, right, there's a Manhattan DA indictment that's also not a federal charge. This is for conduct that occurred while he was president in the United States, not beforehand, not this is not just some sort of books and records violation. This is a chart for him over trying to overturn the election in Georgia.</p><p>And as I think, you know, Marshall pointed out a moment ago, there are potentially others that can be part of this. And, you know, there is an interplay between this and those other cases. If, for example, John Eastman, or Rudy Giuliani faces a charge here, and ultimately decides that it's in their best interest to cooperate, that could have an impact on these other investigations as well. So definitely important. There's really a multiplier effect and an interplay between these different prosecutions that we should keep in mind.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Another commonality in all of this, Marshall, even though there are distinctions of these, you know, three indictments and now a possible fourth is that Trump style is to go after the prosecutors, go after the Special Counsel Jack Smith, go after the DA you know, Alvin Bragg and also his record of going after and I'm talking about verbally, you know, taunting threats however you want to put it of Fani Willis.</p><p>[15:15:07]</p><p>So given that then, Marshall, you know, how does that continue to complicate these cases, even as these prosecutors special counsel may try to coordinate with one another.</p><p>COHEN: The atmosphere of threats and intimidation and vitriol has only been getting stronger and stronger. And, you know, with Fani Willis, who is an African American woman elected in Atlanta, she's actually the first woman to hold that position of DA in Fulton County. A lot of the attacks have been racial in character, you know, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Donald Trump himself regularly accuses Fani Willis of being racist, and Marxist and a lunatic.</p><p>And he actually, in the past several days, spread some incredibly ugly claims that are totally false about her that I won't even repeat. She has had security beefed up not just in the courthouse but for her personally. And, look, if he does end up as a criminal defendant in the state of Georgia, he will have to answer to a judge.</p><p>And those comments may be brought before the judge, just like they have been right here in Washington DC, as we literally saw yesterday, with a hearing in his federal election subversion case where prosecutors were flagging to the judge, Trump's post on Truth Social, if you come after me, I'll come after you and whether that type of rhetoric where that falls on the line between free speech defending oneself and a serious threat to to the interests of justice.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, Fani Willis has said she has been called the N word and been subjected to, you know, threats of violence more in the last year than she has in her entire life and the connection that she's made to the investigation of the former president. All right, Marshall Cohen, Renato Mariotti. Thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.</p><p>COHEN: Thank you.</p><p>MARIOTTI: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, still to come. The political impact of this breaking news, new signs that a fourth indictment for Donald Trump could be coming soon in Fulton County, Georgia. The former president campaigning right now in Iowa as you see right there. We're live from Des Moines, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:21:17]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Former President Donald Trump is at the Iowa State Fair where he is drawing in quite the crowd of supporters. And this coming after former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia and CNN contributor Geoff Duncan revealed to CNN today that he has been told to testify before Fulton County grand jury about the former president's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p><p>Joining me right now is CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is at the state fair. And Geoff Duncan telling me about his appearance now on Tuesday. He said that today. Has that signal been sent to the former president? And has he commented on it?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, look, Frederick, and this is something that former President Donald Trump obviously has been expecting. In fact, he's been campaigning on the fact that he is anticipating. And in fact, even he would say looking forward to a fourth indictment in Georgia, at least politically. Legally, of course, it is a very different matter. But the news was happening as he was flying here to the state fair. He made a comment about it on his social media channel, again, talking about that phone call that is really at issue here in the Georgia investigation. He again called it a perfect call. Of course, we heard that call for ourselves when he was asking the Georgia Secretary of State for more votes.</p><p>So you know, there's no doubt that that is hanging over the Trump campaign, as are the other indictments, but he at least politically speaking, is using that to gain support and for his advantages here, but he was here at the State Fair, working out his supporters talking to others, of course, he is still a celebrity. So he gains more attention and notice than some of his rivals might. But he talked about his standing here in Iowa. And now he plans to campaign aggressively and remain the front runner.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We are going to take any chances. We're way up in the polls in Iowa and all over the country, we have a over 50 points. That's a lot. But we don't want to take any chances. We'll be back. We love you very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZELENY: Now, he's not quite up by 50 percent. But there's no doubt that he is a front runner. All of his rivals know that very well. But the question is, will he remain that as these developments happen throughout the next several months? Of course, the first debate is in less than two weeks time and these indictments are playing out.</p><p>But even though he's the front runner, there are at least half the party polls and in our reporting would suggest that Republicans are looking in a different direction open to someone else. So we will of course have to let this play out. But this is very much Fredricka, a competition that is is is fully engaged. You can tell that by seeing so many of his rivals here at the fair today campaigning as well.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Oh, they are indeed. All right. Jeff Zeleny. Thanks so much. We'll check back with you.</p><p>All right, straight ahead. As Maui residents begin to assess the loss and Lahaina, we're seeing more videos of harrowing escapes out of Lahaina. We'll show you how one family and their pets made it out alive.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:28:27]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right on the road to Lahaina on Maui, the traffic grows once again as does the frustration as residents are kept from returning to their homes and businesses. It's the second time the main road into the hard hit area abruptly was shut down. The line of cars waiting there stretch for nearly a mile. So you can see right there. At least 80 people died and many more are missing after wildfires raged across the island this week. Let's go now to CNN Mike Valeria. Who is on Maui. Mike, what is the latest on people trying to get in being turned around being told? You know that the situation is very tenuous.</p><p>MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Federicka. It's unbelievable. After all the heartstopping images that we've seen since Tuesday afternoon with people waiting to get in sometimes 15 hours or more. It is now at times traffic here on Maui (ph) that is deciding whether or not people get in past this police perimeter.</p><p>So when you walk with me down here, this is the main road that is into this and just over to my right Ssome of these folks have been waiting since far before dawn. The story essentially, Fredericka, is that this roadway reopened yesterday but because too many people were going into Lahaina beyond the barriers that were meant to only be accessed by FEMA that weren't investigated yet by first responders.</p><p>[15:30:03]</p><p>The police here in Maui said all right now we got to stop everybody, we're going to shut this down and reassess how we are managing this.</p><p>So you know, on that front Fredericka, we spoke to a bunch of motorists before dawn, take a listen to what they told us about their own journeys. Patrick made it in, Todd did not the second gentleman you're going to hear from listen to what they said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK THURSTON, LAHAINA RESIDENT: I got out here by 11 made it all the way to the other side. I was done by 3:00 picking up all the supplies I got. And then got to here and I've been here since 3:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>VALERIO: You've been here since three?</p><p>THURSTON: Yes, we nobody -- none of us has moved. My coworker she's up there two trucks, my other -- I got three other coworkers down there. They're back there. They've been here the whole time.</p><p>TODD DOMECK, LAHAINA RESIDENT: It's either laughter or tears, you know. So when I talked to all the people in our business that have been affected, about 14 people that have lost their houses, and -- so we're just trying to do the most good we can, but it's really frustrating when you can't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALERIO: So what you should know Fred is this is the latest in the storyline that is all about communication, everything from the emergency sirens, the cell phone, or it's not going through, because beyond this perimeter, there's not much cellphone service since Tuesday. This is the latest when you think about all the people who are waiting in this line, going back for about a mile. We're trying to get the word out to them. People who are turned around are trying to say, look, as soon as I go down this road, I'm going to tell people that because there's this traffic jam, don't go any farther.</p><p>In terms of, Fredericka, the new reporting that CNN has for the wider picture of what it is going to take to rebuild. We have new numbers out from FEMA, that estimate it's going to take $5.5 billion to rebuild the epicenter of this crisis area.</p><p>Also 2,200 structures damaged or destroyed. 4,500 People who are projected to be in need of long term shelter. So, essentially what people back in the mainland and around the world should know. This is just the start of rebuilding of finding how structures like your homes if they made it from late Tuesday night into Wednesday, if people survived as well. This is just another roadblock, another chapter for people's misery here on Maui. Fred?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, misery on Maui. That's one way to put it. Thank you so much, Mike Valario.</p><p>All right. A couple in Lahaina is sharing their terrifying escape to safety after the wildfire barreled toward their home. CNN affiliate Hawaii News Now has their story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL PERKINS, LAHAINA RESIDENT: Oh my god, I think we need to load up the car maybe. Oh my God. It is so close.</p><p>MAHEALANI RICHARDSON, REPORTER, HAWAII NEWS NOW (voiceover): Jill and Mike Perkins say the Lahaina fire started just behind their Millstreet home around 3:30 Tuesday with no notice to evacuate. They jumped in their car with their dog, two cats and just a few items.</p><p>PERKINS: Oh my god.</p><p>RICHARDSON: As the angry flames roared all around them.</p><p>PERKINS: We have the kiddies and I have you.</p><p>RICHARDSON: They desperately tried to figure out how to escape.</p><p>PERKINS: I thought we were going to die. I said oh my god, this can't be happening right now. The Mckeeva tree. Next there our house.</p><p>RICHARDSON: Their Lahaina home devoured as they fled.</p><p>PERKINS: (INAUDIBLE) I'm just going to chip for the freeway here.</p><p>I only took a videotape because I knew that that was probably the last time we'll be there. And it was just like, unbelievable to watch.</p><p>MIKE PERKINS, LAHAINA RESIDENT: Just turn right by it and keep going.</p><p>J. PERKINS: Oh my god.</p><p>RICHARDSON (on camera): The Perkins a traffic was at a standstill because of live wires overhaul Honoapiilani Highway. Then he called crews put down plywood over the lines. And they drove over it one car at a time. They say each second was excruciating.</p><p>M. PERKINS: Like probably 80 cars in front of us.</p><p>J. PERKINS: I don't know. It just --</p><p>M. PERKINS: You know, 60 or 80 cars.</p><p>J. PERKINS: It just seemed like every second was 10 hours waiting. And I kept saying do we get out and run. Things are hitting our car like branches and embers we're hitting our car, live wire hit our car, with their car.</p><p>M. PERKINS: We had a power of live powerline at the top of our car. I was terrified and I was concerned for our family and for all the other people there.</p><p>RICHARDSON: They made it to Kahului in two and a half hours their house now in ashes but memories of their beloved Dickinson plantation home and Lahaina still strong. Mahealani Richardson, Hawaii News Now.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And there are so many stories of escaped just like that.</p><p>[15:35:02]</p><p>Meantime, there's also growing criticism over how authorities handled the early moments of the wildfires as flames spread across the island. Hawaii's Attorney General will lead a review of the state's response leading up to the fires.</p><p>There are questions and concerns about the warning sirens that were not activated, which critics say cost some people their lives. That's not the only concern about Hawaii's wildfire preparedness. Here's CNN Pam Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): CNN is learning Hawaii officials underestimated the risk of wildfires and a recent report. Even as other documents show officials knew they lacked resources to prevent and fight fires.</p><p>ABBY FRAZIER, CLIMATOLOGIST, CLARK UNIVERSITY: We had advanced notice coming into the summer this week. The winds the low humidity and the fuels, any ignition would have sparked a pretty big fire and that's exactly what we saw.</p><p>BROWN: In a state report out just last year ranking natural disasters, Hawaii officials classified the wildfire risk to human life as low in this color coded chart. The assessment though coming years after Hurricane Lane fanned the flames of fires in Hawaii ravaging Maui and Oahu in 2018. That perfect storm of conditions highlighted the threat and how unprepared officials in Hawaii were dealing with such a disaster.</p><p>With the county report in 2021, Noting hurricane Lane made small fires swell and stretch public safety resources with strong winds grounding air support, that storm should have been a wake-up call according to this planning document from Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency.</p><p>Other state and local documents show Hawaii lagged behind and preparedness for the devastating wildfires playing out now that have killed more than 50 people left countless people missing and triggered widespread evacuations, a cruel deja vu for some residents.</p><p>MARK STEFL, LST HOME TO FIRE TWICE: About four years ago, we had another hurricane and we lost our house in the fire. Rebuilt. And what happened yesterday is killing me right now. We just lost our house again twice in four years.</p><p>BROWN: A 2021 report also makes the troubling point that despite the increasing number of wildfires, fire prevention was given quote, short shrift in a strategic plan from Maui County's Department of Fire and Safety. The plan also included quote nothing about what can and should be done to prevent fires, which it called a significant oversight.</p><p>FRAZIER: Given how catastrophic this event was. I think there will be a lot of pressure on the state and other organizations to improve their fire prevention actions that they're taking statewide.</p><p>BROWN: The increase in fires in Hawaii comes as Maui has faced increasing drought conditions in recent years, contributing to warnings like this, and I'm a webinar from Nani Barreto with the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization.</p><p>NANI BARRETO, HAWAII WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION: Hawaii has a big wildfire problem. We are on par with the most fire prone states in the western continental US. The impacts of fire are broad and long lasting.</p><p>BROWN: Now residents like Mark Stefl are left to rebuild again as the threat of future disasters looms with no clear plan in place.</p><p>STEFL: I mean, I know what I needed to do. We've done it before. It sucks.</p><p>BROWN: Pamela Brown, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And for more information on how you can help Hawaii wildfire victims go to cnn.com/impact or text Hawaii to 707070 to donate.</p><p>Ukraine once again appearing to target a key bridge in Crimea used by Russia. We'll show you what happened as the missiles approached.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:43:05]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Traffic is once again flowing across the Crimean bridge after three Ukrainian missiles were shut down. That's according to a Russian backed official.</p><p>Meantime, Ukrainian authorities are discussing a possible mandatory evacuation of children in the Kupiansk region of Kharkiv as Russia intensifies its shelling. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is Dnipro and he has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Again dramatic scenes around the Kerch Bridge the really only independent link that runs from the Russian mainland to the occupied Crimean peninsula of Ukraine that was annexed by Russia in 2014.</p><p>We've seen previous attacks on that cause damage to it. It's unclear if today's scenes resulted in damage to the bridge. Certainly Russian officials said it did not. And that two missiles one they said an adapted S-200 anti-aircraft missile were in fact intercepted. And then what in fact holidaymakers people on the beach films, the extraordinary scenes was instead, a smokescreen designed to you might say obscure any strike had occurred or make it harder for the missile to impact the bridge itself.</p><p>But again, a reminder for Russians of how things they may have considered to have been impregnable at the start of the war, now clearly in Ukraine's reach. We've seen Ukrainian drone attacks in the east part of the Black Sea recently, and it appears one on the Kerch Bridge itself as well.</p><p>And so today's attack, another reminder that if Ukraine is finding the southern counteroffensive moving at a slower pace than it would like it's still able to hit key parts of Russian infrastructure. It seems at will even if today's attack wasn't successful.</p><p>We're also to hearing of a Ukrainian order to evacuate a city known as Kupiansk not far from Kharkiv. They've been saying that the 12,000 civilians who've returned there, since it was liberated from the Russians last, that they should evacuate and now a more direct order for the children there possibly over 500 to be taken out immediately.</p><p>[15:45:07]</p><p>This is because of a Russian push there, intense artillery strikes on what remains of that town and a sign that perhaps Moscow is trying to change the narrative after feeling intense pressure in the south to find another area of work, perhaps and distract Ukrainian forces and force them to readjust where their strength necessarily is, but still seem to gain at that bridge to Crimea, a reminder that even though this counteroffensive is sort of moving at a slower pace than Ukraine would like it's able to project strength elsewhere. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: And a moment of normality in the Ukrainian city of Odesa, the area's beaches have been reopened for the first time since the Russian invasion. Odesa once thrived with busy holiday resorts but has been the site of relentless shelling almost since the war began.</p><p>Authorities say the beach will still be closed to swimmers during air raid alerts.</p><p>All right, coming up. A Michigan police chief has issued an apology after officers wrongly detained a child while he was taking the trash out behind his home. More details straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:50:42]</p><p>WHITFIELD: The police chief in Lansing, Michigan issuing an apology after an incident in which a black child was handcuffed by officers while he was taking out the trash behind his home. CNN Isabel Rosales is following the developments for us. So what exactly is the chief saying?</p><p>ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Fred. Lansing police are calling this a case of mistaken identity saying that this was the wrong time in the wrong place. And in fact, they put out two pictures of side by side comparison, showing the public the suspect who they were looking for. And then the 12-year-old boy that they mistakenly detained.</p><p>This all caught national attention due to a TikTok video put out by a neighbor who shot this confrontation on their cell phone showing the boy right there in handcuffs. And then the father later on in the video shouting from several feet away. That boy is then placed in the back of a police car. He is then after a short time released, uncuffed and released back to his father.</p><p>This TikTok video right here about over nearly 5 million views and thousands of comments. Now the boy's father Michael Bernard spoke with WILX an affiliate of CNN. He says that he was washing the dishes and then told his son Tashawn to take out the trash. And here's what he said happened during an off camera interview with our affiliate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL BERNARD, BOY'S FATHER: I get concerned when I didn't see him come back within that period of time. And I walk out to here, look out and to my surprise the cops had him in handcuffs. I was mad about it. That was my sudden never do it breaking the law. So I rushed down and asked the cop what's the problem? Well, you have my son in handcuff just like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSALES: And the family has since that video right there, that interviewer done a virtual news conference and has spoken publicly about what transpired there. Lansing Police Department says that they were searching for a suspect in a string of car thefts and then a witness came forward and describe that suspect is having neon shorts and a white shirt and that is why they detained this child 12 years old that was wearing similar clothing and was actually in the same apartment complex as the witness said that this accused car thief had run off to.</p><p>So the police Chief Ellery Sosobee has issued an apology. Here's part of the statement he put out, as the chief of police, I want to apologize that this incident had such an effect on this young man, and again 12 years old here, and his family. I'm asking for the community to consider all the facts of the situation before making a judgment. The relationship with our community has been and will continue to be a top priority for the Lansing Police Department.</p><p>And Fred the family here, the Barnard family has gotten a hold of an attorney. And they -- the attorney is claiming that his client was wearing a gray shirt not a white one and was visibly much younger than the suspect. CNN has not independently been able to confirm the color that the child was wearing during that incident. And the family is considering legal action against the city.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, Isabel Rosales, thanks so much.</p><p>ROSALES: Thanks.</p><p>WHITFIELD: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:58:14]</p><p>WHITFIELD: Right now Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is playing in a preseason game today his first since collapsing on the field during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals earlier this year. Hamlin went into cardiac arrest in January after making a tackle and appearing to take a hit to his chest.</p><p>Doctors and trainers performed CPR on Hamlin when he lost his pulse and needed to be revived. He was on a ventilator for days and spent over a week in the hospital. The 25-year-old was cleared to resume football activities in April and first set back onto the field in June.</p><p>All right, the world's largest cruise ship hasn't welcomed a single passenger yet, but it's already riding a wave of free publicity. The Icon of the Seas is nearly 1,200 feet long. That's about 300 feet longer than the Titanic has 20 decks and a capacity of 10,000 people.</p><p>But when this image went viral in July, it was called everything from a pile of decadence to an icon of disease. It is expected to rake in about $10 million a week.</p><p>And finally look up tonight you just might happen to see one of nature's most stunning light displays. The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak this weekend. The streaks of light will be most visible to viewers in the northern hemisphere just a few hours before dawn and there is the potential to see over 50 meteors per hour streak across the sky.

(AP) \u2014 Cooler weather on Friday helped crews trying to keep California wildfires away from a grove of gigantic ancient sequoias, including the world's largest tree, the base of which had been wrapped in a fire-resistant material in case the flames reached it.</p><p>Unlike raging wildfires that have burned vast swaths of the drought-stricken U.S. West this summer, the blazes in Sequoia National Park were not explosive. Flames were about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been slow growth,\u201d fire information officer Katy Hooper said.</p><p>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fires-environment-and-nature-forests-trees-wildfires-16c2303399942a4015d3a780d2eec4e3\">Firefighters</url> have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), as well as some other trees and buildings.</p><p>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.</p><p>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns \u2014 fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes \u2014 and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.</p><p>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\u201d fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.</p><p>But a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac\">historic drought tied to climate change</url> is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles (13 square kilometers). The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles (34 square kilometers).</p><p>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.</p><p>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.</p><p>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-travel-mountains-fires-environment-and-nature-eb56661ee9a13ba8078d9774e4952600\">Lake Tahoe</url>, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march.

Record heat and drought are sucking moisture from trees and undergrowth. And some regions are seeing more violent thunderstorms, whose lightning can provide a fateful spark.</p><p>Scientists say forest restoration and other natural solutions could provide up to one-third of the mitigation needed to keep global warming below 2C.</p><p>\"Anything that combats climate change, including restoring and expanding the store of carbon in forests, is helping to reduce the risk of extreme wildfires,\" said Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate Unit at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>Large-scale forest conservation and restoration can also counter extreme wildfire more directly. While intact forests may become more diverse and less fire-prone with age, where forests are degraded restoration can help to accelerate their return to a more natural condition.</p><p>\"More people need to have a stake in restoring and managing these landscapes, and more support from governments and business in order to make it happen.\"</p><p>Peter Moore, forest fire expert, FAO</p><p>Fighting fire with fire</p><p>In many temperate forest ecosystems, restoring natural fire patterns is vital, experts say. That means ending a common focus on preventing fire at all costs. Landscapes that burn cyclically contain less flammable material. When fire does occur, it spares larger trees, invigorates the ecosystem and is less likely to threaten people.</p><p>Letting wildfires run their course may be the most effective way to restore some types of forest, especially in remote areas. Near towns and villages, managed burning may be safer. Fires can be set when weather conditions and soil moisture make the flames easier to contain. Forests can also be thinned by hand or with machinery.</p><p>\"Wildfire can act as a self-regulating mechanism,\" said Cara Nelson, a professor of restoration ecology at the University of Montana, United States. \"In forests adapted to frequent fire, we want fire back and that means we need to learn to live with it.\"</p><p>Restorative principles can be incorporated into strategies to defend properties in fire-prone regions. Residents can plant fire-tolerant native plants around their home and avoid more flammable or exotic species that can become invasive.</p><p>Firefighters battling a megafire in California. Some researchers argue that small, controlled blazes can prevent more devastating fires.

In many situations, forest ecosystems will quickly rebound on their own, depending on the intensity and impacts of the fire. In others, interventions can aid and steer that process.</p><p>When fires strip landscapes of vegetation, hillsides are vulnerable to massive erosion that can hinder a forest's recovery. Reseeding can reduce the risk of soil loss and landslides and protect water supplies. Using native grasses can block invasive competitors.</p><p>Where fire has damaged the habitat of rare wildlife, replanting specific trees and plants may help target populations to survive. In eastern Australia, for instance, ecologists are re-establishing mistletoe in forests used by an endangered bird, the regent honeyeater.</p><p>Restoration can begin even while a fire is still burning, in the form of first aid and rehabilitation for injured wildlife. Food drops for species whose natural larders have been destroyed can help them survive, as can programmes to control invasive predators.</p><p>Food drops are critical to helping species and their ecosystems bounce back after fires. Photo: Reuters/Pamela Schramm</p><p>Reviving landscapes</p><p>Active replanting is a focus in forest landscape restoration in some fire-prone areas. In Portugal's Algarve region, for instance, a project aims to recreate belts of native, fire-resistant cork oak forest among more flammable commercial plantations of eucalyptus and pine.</p><p>Portugal is also an example of how reducing the risk from fire can mean restoring the economic and social fabric of whole regions. The country's new national fire management plan bundles natural and social restoration as one of its five pillars. Measures to prevent catastrophic fires include valuing rural landscapes more highly.</p><p>\"More people need to have a stake in restoring and managing these landscapes, and more support from governments and business is needed in order to make it happen,\" said Peter Moore, a forest fire expert with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \"Strong rural communities can understand the value as well as the risks of fire.\"</p><p>The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030, led by the United Nations Environment Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and partners, covers terrestrial as well as coastal and marine ecosystems. A global call to action, it will draw together political support, scientific research and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124110214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61DW-Y9M1-JCBF-S1J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 Cooler weather on Friday helped crews trying to keep California wildfires away from a grove of gigantic ancient sequoias, including the world's largest tree, the base of which had been wrapped in a fire-resistant material in case the flames reached it.</p><p>Unlike raging wildfires that have burned vast swaths of the drought-stricken U.S. West this summer, the blazes in Sequoia National Park were not explosive. Flames were about a mile (1.5 kilometers) from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been slow growth,\u201d fire information officer Katy Hooper said.</p><p>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fires-environment-and-nature-forests-trees-wildfires-16c2303399942a4015d3a780d2eec4e3\">Firefighters</url> have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), as well as some other trees and buildings.</p><p>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.</p><p>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns \u2014 fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes \u2014 and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.</p><p>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\u201d fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.</p><p>But a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ut-state-wire-az-state-wire-id-state-wire-or-state-wire-nv-state-wire-d1f130f8826ef57c74db611e959937ac\">historic drought tied to climate change</url> is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles (13 square kilometers). The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles (34 square kilometers).</p><p>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.</p><p>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles (28 square kilometers) on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.</p><p>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-travel-mountains-fires-environment-and-nature-eb56661ee9a13ba8078d9774e4952600\">Lake Tahoe</url>, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its destructive march. Containment there has reached 71%.</p><p>Meanwhile, a big change in weather was taking shape in parts of the drought-stricken, fire-scarred West.</p><p>Forecasters said a storm heading in from the Pacific would bring rain to the Pacific Northwest and parts of Northern California through the weekend. The rain was not expected to come as far south as Sequoia National Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-545b327cf3666cf65e6dd4b951b740e920210917</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63MH-MMS1-JC5B-G2TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><timeReceived>9:36 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Fireweed is BCIT's first-ever podcast series that shares stories about people who have preserved in the face of disruption and re-written their story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why Fireweed?</p><p>After the devastation of a forest fire, the first plant to grow back is fireweed. A vibrant wildflower from the Pacific Northwest, fireweed symbolizes hope, resilience, and adaptability--things we could all use a little more of right now.</p><p>Adaptability is now seen as the critical skill by leading employers across the country. But the trick is: we need to adapt in the right ways. Ways that will help us move forward, together. Through Fireweed, BCIT is connecting education and industry to power resilience, foster hope, and strengthen adaptability.</p><p>Stories and guests on Fireweed</p><p>Listeners will follow host and BCIT Broadcast and Online Journalism alumna Maria Vinca through conversations with thought leaders and experts from throughout the Cascadia Corridor and beyond. Meet academics, industry leaders, and people from business and tech who are working to create resilient systems--all built to handle change. Compelling and personal stories from people with vastly different experiences who have demonstrated their ability to grow and adapt to whatever challenges life throws at them and--like fireweed--come back stronger than ever.</p><p>That's why this diverse and inter-generational podcast, brought to you by BCIT, tells stories that embody our never-ending human potential to adapt to change.</p><p>In season one of this podcast series, listeners will enjoy discussions around:</p><p>* Accessibility - Featuring Humboldt Bronco player Ryan Straschnitzki's journey from hockey hopeful to accessibility advocate. Brad McCannell from the Rick Hansen Foundation also highlights what we need to do to make the built environment work for people with disabilities, and how eventually we'll all have accessibility needs.</p><p>* Sustainability - Building cities has traditionally meant altering or destroying the natural environment, but it doesn't have to be like that. Explore Ecocities beyond the \"eco\" with Mark Angelo, Founder of World Rivers Day.</p><p>* Cybersecurity - Cybersecurity experts and IT departments warn us about it, but how seriously do we really take our online security? Join Derek Manky, Chief of Security Insights and Global Threat Alliances for Fortinet and discover the dangers of doing business in a hyper-connected world.</p><p>* Mid-career shift - The mid-life crisis is a well-documented trope, but recently, mid-life career transition is gaining recognition as a uniquely modern phenomenon. Ryan Chynces from Hootsuite speaks to how micro credentials have helped him recruit and support current staff.</p><p>* Digital transformation and education - Education is changing. Technology has always been a part of the classroom but the current wave of innovation is kicking open doors we didn't even know existed. Hear from local educators, including UBC professor Claudia Krebs.</p><p>* The future of transportation - From an electric vehicle (EV) early adopter to a researcher working on smart microgrids, these are some of the pioneers shaping the future of transportation.</p><p>Fireweed launches with episode one on September 20, 2021, and is available wherever you get your podcasts.

With cooler temperatures tonight, that smoke that normally leaves us\" will remain.</p><p>Reduced visibility on the Interstate 25 corridor south to Watrous is among the likely results of that stagnation, he said.</p><p>\"We're having major impacts with other fires joining,\" Ranspot said. He urged drivers to travel slowly because shifting winds can rapidly change visibility conditions.</p><p>As residents evacuated, a key question remained unanswered: How much damage have the combined Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires done?</p><p>Determining the answer could take two to three days, team incident commander Carl Schwope said during the briefing.</p><p>\"The amount of fire growth yesterday had a significant impact on private property, but we want that information to be accurate,\" he said. \"This is a large fire, and there's a lot of places to cover.\"</p><p>Additional resources were on the way to help fight the fire, Schwope said, without offering specifics. He said after the fire had grown considerably Friday the team didn't have enough resources to do everything it had wanted to do simultaneously.</p><p>Jayson Coil, the team's operations section chief, said the fire had not crossed N.M. 518 as of shortly before 6p.m. - but that it might overnight.</p><p>Fellow team member Americk Padilla, the Mora County undersheriff, said he'd just returned from a site near the blaze and sounded an optimistic tone.</p><p>\"I was seeing the progress that the guys on the ground are making,\" he said. \"They're kicking butt; they're doing what they're supposed to do.\"</p><p>Fire behavior analyst Stewart Turner also shared a less-than-dire projection.</p><p>\"I'm not expecting a big growth day tomorrow, but we will see some perimeter growth,\" he said.</p><p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who delivered an update Saturday afternoon in Santa Fe, issued a declaration of emergency Saturday for surrounding Mora County. The move was aimed at freeing up federal money to help.</p><p>Elsewhere in New Mexico</p><p>About 7 miles east of Jemez Springs, the Cerro Pelado Fire was at 4,688 acres and zero percent containment Saturday morning, according to an update on the New Mexico Fire Information website. Sandoval County issued evacuation orders for Sierra de Los Pinos and other communities near the fire, and N.M. 4 was closed from N.M. 126 east to</p><p>Los Alamos.</p><p>About 30 personnel were on the scene, and wind gusts above 40 mph were possible in spots, according to the update. It added firefighters were focused Saturday on protecting homes and keeping the fire from crossing to the west of Forest Road 10.</p><p>Los Alamos National Laboratory stated in a news release it's about 10 miles from the blaze and was not in immediate danger and helicopters had begun dropping water on the fire.</p><p>The blazes continued to burn a day after high winds tore through Northern New Mexico, spreading fires, kicking up dust, fueling fears of downed power lines and otherwise complicating firefighters' already-daunting task.</p><p>According to an update on the New Mexico Fire Information website,</p><p>419 personnel were involved in battling the merged Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires near Gallinas Canyon.</p><p>Power has been shut off for safety reasons in Pendaries, Rociada, Manuelitas and Ca\u00f1oncito and along County Road A-3A. Several roads were closed, including N.M. 518 from Sapello north to Buena Vista, the update stated.</p><p>In Harding County, the new Mitchell Fire on private land east of Mosquero on N.M. 39 was estimated at 20,000 acres and was zero percent contained. Crews were set to continue building containment lines around the blaze into the evening.</p><p>In Union County, the Campbell Road Fire east of Des Moines was estimated Saturday at 2,000 acres and 90 percent contained. Firefighters were set to work through the weekend to mop up and secure containment lines.</p><p>In Taos County, a small blaze off</p><p>N.M. 518 east of Pe\u00f1asco was about</p><p>5 acres and 10 percent contained. The Carson National Forest fire is within the burn scar of the 2011 Osha Fire, largely surrounded by natural barriers such as rocks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15664131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:659V-BWG1-DY7H-R4YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 24, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001794</classCode><className>VEHICLE TRAFFIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DABR</classCode><className>MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He seems to be gaining some traction though, we'll see how long that lasts. We'll talk to him on Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, here's THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov, Charlie Hurt and she paddleboards on a tongue depressor, Dana Perino. THE FIVE.</p><p>There's a brand new tourist attraction in America that's all the rage, but you might want to get your hepatitis shot first. A local San Francisco guide is offering a $30.00 doom loop walking tour of the city's most crime- ridden spots, letting people get a good whiff of the liberal policies that have turned America's wealthiest city into a cesspool of open-air drug markets and homeless encampments.</p><p>And while San Fran's decay could be a boon to certain tourism, it's a death sentence to retailers. The owner of Gump's San Francisco, a place that I used to frequent as little Greg is warning that they might close for good after 166 years of doing business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN CHACHAS, OWNER, GUMP'S SAN FRANCISCO: Our business is a business that people love and people want to come into San Francisco, want to come visit a store.</p><p>But if you can't get around, and when you're trying to walk the streets you step over needles in human waste, and often bodies on the streets. It makes it an unworkable business environment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: And if that wasn't enough human misery on display, how about Philly, where businesses are now being forced to set up booby traps like hidden sprinklers to ward off drug addicts who keep scaring customers. A former drug dealer turned activist comparing the situation in Philly to a zombie movie.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK RODRIGUEZ, YOUTUBER AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: Kensington. Now again, it is the first stop, they come off the train, they come right down here. And it's like illegal pass. Do whatever you want.</p><p>When you see the chaos that's going around, you're going to see people blood run down there arm, needles in their neck, needle in their arm, pipe in their mouth, everything goes out.</p><p>You're literally dealing with chemical warfare. You know, that's what's happening. You see the people falling apart, limbs falling off. You've seen that people when we were down there, there's arm. It looks like a zombie movie.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: And speaking of drug addiction, the problem is only getting worse. Americans say fentanyl poisonings are now the biggest public health risk that the country faces surging to number one, followed by obesity, gun violence, and cancer.</p><p>So, Charlie, I want to go to you first. I think that we have to pay the Biden administration a compliment. They created new jobs with the doom loop tours. These jobs would not have happened if it wasn't for his leadership.</p><p>CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: That's really finding the silver lining, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it is.</p><p>HURT: Very impressive.</p><p>GUTFELD: Thank you.</p><p>HURT: But you do have to sort of give a nod to American ingenuity. I mean, you know, Americans have always -- or I guess people of all stripes have always loved. They love horror movies. They love freak shows. And that's what this is. It's a modern-day freak show, circus freak show.</p><p>And it's also, it goes to why Democrats are so successful talking about climate change is that all of the terrifying stuff that they promote on their climate change agenda is it's such a great movie, everybody wants to go see the horror movie.</p><p>But the idea that you would sit here and say, well, it's really not, it's really not as dramatic as they're saying that no one's going to go see that movie. Nobody wants to see the movie that oh, no, it's all natural.</p><p>But no, the larger problem here, and obviously, it's a huge problem, it's a complex problem and it's a horrifying problem. You have so many families of all socio-economic backgrounds, all parts of the country who are affected by this. And it's horrifying.</p><p>There's a limited amount of things that the government can do to tackle this, but everything that the government can do, such as closing the border, or allowing the thriving economy or prosecuting drug convictions, the Biden administration, has completely failed to do.</p><p>And, you know, when you talk to people who have recovered from drug addiction, especially with opioids, that number of them who say that getting arrested and going to jail was what turned me around ought to be a lesson for us to about where to go forward from here.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know, Judge, you look at these store owners in Philly setting up booby traps. It's kind of funny, but you know, if anything goes awry, they're the ones that go to jail.</p><p>JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST: Doesn't it remind you, Greg, of the -- there was a guy who was -- took a hose to some homeless people in front of his business, and I think he got arrested for something or charged with something.</p><p>Look, I was a narcotics judge and I was also a D.A. and I created and helped create the drug courts in Westchester County.</p><p>Look, you need the leverage. You need the stick. They're not going to go into treatment unless they're faced with jail time. And a lot of them would rather go to jail than go to treatment.</p><p>So, we had something going for us when we had the big stick and the leverage. What has happened now is we have so normalized drug abuse and drug addiction, that we have created these safe injection sites and vending machines, and with needles and all kinds of laws that literally protect these people and allow them to do this in front of residences and businesses.</p><p>In front of your house, Greg, if you want to put a three-foot fence, that, you know, you'll get charged and fined for doing that, but they can do that all over and destroy things.</p><p>And drugs are more dangerous than ever now, if ever there were a time to at least consider the criminal justice system as leverage, it's now, because the little fentanyl is going to kill you.</p><p>And let's not let Fauci off the hook. All of this -- a lot of this happened because of the school lockouts and the -- and the lockdowns in homes. And the highest overdose rate in this country wasn't 2022. And that was because people couldn't go to treatment, they couldn't have meetings, and we're in a bad place.</p><p>So, we've got to figure out like San Diego did. It's really easy to clean this stuff up. You pass laws, you enforce laws, and then people like the guy from Gump's don't have to stand there and say we can't live like this. There is an intentional destruction of America, and it should stop and it can stop.</p><p>GUTFELD: Speaking of COVID, this is interesting, Dana. Everything was shut down, basically, except for liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, because they were considered essential services. Now, if they'd shut them down, you would have had moonshine, which is what you're seeing right now in our streets. We're having moonshine fentanyl, because there's no access to safe fentanyl, so they make their own and then everybody dies.</p><p>So, I think logically, you could make the conclusion that if you actually made safe legal drugs available, you would probably see less overdoses, less of these crazy people on the street.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Yes, I do think there's merit to that. I just don't know what the experiment. Like, Portland tried it.</p><p>GUTFELD: That was decriminalization, not legalization.</p><p>PERINO: Right. So, I don't know. I would love to see like, could we just get one test area? Who's going to volunteer to be the test area?</p><p>GUTFELD: I volunteer where Charlie lives.</p><p>HURT: Comparing fentanyl to moonshine. Moonshine is healthy. It's really good.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. I apologize. I had no idea.</p><p>HURT: It's not dangerous. It doesn't come from China. It's really delicious.</p><p>PERINO: What the Judge was saying about COVID and 2022, what else happened then? 2021 and 2022, the border is wide open.</p><p>So, then, all the opioids have come on, the fentanyl is coming across and now you have the one pill can kill situation. In California, 20 percent of the deaths were ages 18 to 25. And I went down this list of Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, it's all the same. All the statistics.</p><p>So today, Victor Davis Hanson, he did a interview. I haven't watched the interview. And I was just reading about it, where he was talking about the fall of the Byzantine and the Roman Empire and what happened.</p><p>And I was just thinking about how you just went to Italy. A lot of people we know have gone to Europe this year, because one of the reasons you go is not just the food, but it's to experience the most beautiful monuments and the architecture and the tremendous civilization progress that was made over those years.</p><p>And what are we doing? We are tearing down our own historic art. Some people say they don't deserve to be up there. But do you destroy them? Or do you put them on a park somewhere?</p><p>We are letting our citizens lie in their own excrement. You remember the other day when you said the young women going to Pilates on Sixth Avenue. I'm not a young woman anymore. But I was going to Pilates today.</p><p>Every single block, there was a man line in his own excrement. You have to -- basically, you cannot breathe through your nose from here to Columbus Circle.</p><p>GUTFELD: You can smell from the car.</p><p>PERINO: It is horrendous. And we are letting people do that. So, I guess, kudos to the entrepreneurs in San Francisco who are trying to figure out a way to make dominate out of doom.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, you know, Jessica, it seems that your party has turned the American dream into a narcotic one. What do you have to say for all the destruction that your party has unleashed on what was once the greatest country that ever was, as it slowly -- well, rather quickly descends into chaos?</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Headline, Greg Gutfeld doesn't think America is the greatest country anymore.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't.</p><p>TARLOV: Right out of your own mouth. I think that this is devastating. I've spoken about it a lot. San Francisco is a really important city to me. I was just there a few weeks ago, and there are parts of it that I used to hang out in that you just don't go anymore and certainly, I wasn't bringing the baby down there. Pushing clear around to see the site and that's really heartbreaking. And it's happening in a lot of cities.</p><p>This isn't something that is new, you don't get to decline at this level in just a couple of years. And I understand that there has always been democratic government there, I think it has accelerated from the effects of COVID.</p><p>But you do see a dichotomy within the Democratic Party in terms of how officials will talk about it. And I think that London Breed has not done as good of a job in doing that. She was late to the game saying now that she's added an extra 200 police officers, but she was resistant to acknowledging a lot of the problems that were in front of everybody.</p><p>And I've said it before, and I'll say it again, these people who are complaining are not Republicans in waiting, they are not turning into voters for the other side. They are Democrats demanding a better quality of life, especially for your tax dollars, which are enormous in cities like that.</p><p>One thing that the owner of Gump's said that I thought was really important, said that one of the ways that we can help with this is that companies need to demand that people go back to work.</p><p>Because if high-end workers are now coming back into the city that will be forced to clean up in a way that you don't have to right now because the buildings are just empty. Right? So you can have squatting, you can have streets full of homeless people.</p><p>But if you have folks that are earning six figures and walking paths, they're not going to be stepping over people to do that. I thought that that was really interesting and smart.</p><p>To your point about legalizing drugs, though, that is part of why these safe injection sites are important, that it is better. If somebody is going to --</p><p>GUTFELD: I's still the illegal drug. That's the problem.</p><p>TARLOV: But you have to -- I understand that and I should note also that the fentanyl seizures are up astronomically.</p><p>So, 300 percent in San Diego, what you call that as a great example, the D.A. announced.</p><p>GUTFELD: They'll just make more.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: And then you leave and you lie on the street. I don't think that's a great idea.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's the issue.</p><p>TARLOV: No, it's not. It's not a perfect solution, but it can be part of it. And they have -- that's been proven out before that safe injection sites do help people because at least you're not putting a dirty needle into your arm and they can make counselors available there.</p><p>GUTFELD: If the counselor doesn't have any drugs on him, they won't listen to him.</p><p>TARLOV: Well, maybe one does.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go. All right.</p><p>PIRRO: You can offer them jail instead, they'll clean up fast.</p><p>PERINO: I like that.</p><p>GUTFELD: Coming up, as Democrats blame climate change, did their push for green energy helped cause the Hawaii fires?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Did the push of green energy lead to the deadliest wildfire in modern American history? A stunning report from The Wall Street Journal lays out how Hawaii's biggest power utility company, Hawaiian Electric, knew that it needed to do more to prevent its power line from emitting sparks but instead focused on spending money on renewable energy sources to combat climate change.</p><p>While the official cause of the fire is still under investigation, videos are emerging from around the time when the disaster first started. And it's raising questions on whether downed power lines caused the deadly blazes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All line that started. Started from up the road there. And all of that is still burning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: But that's not stopping the climate blame game, ABC News had to change a headline after backlash from activists. The original headline reading this, why climate change can't be blamed for the Maui wildfires.</p><p>Well, you can imagine that had to get updated. They changed it to why climate change can't be blamed entirely for the Maui wildfires.</p><p>And President Biden's clean energy adviser John Podesta using the White House podium to blame climate change for the catastrophe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN PODESTA, SENIOR ADVISOR, CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION: To stop these disasters from getting even worse, we have to cut the carbon pollution that's driving the climate crisis. And that's what the Inflation Reduction Act is all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: There was one more thing that we should play for you. This is the first responder, the person in charge and Hawaii talking about the sirens here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you regret not sounding the sirens?</p><p>HERMAN ANDAYA, MAUI EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CHIEF: I do not. The sirens as I mentioned earlier, is used primarily for tsunamis. The public is trained to seek higher ground in the event that the siren is sounded. In fact, on the website of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, the following guideline is provided. If you are in a low-lying area near the coastline, evacuate to high grounds and then vertically to fourth floor and higher.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Lots to discuss on this. Greg, the politics around climate change seems to be absolving people in charge of accountability.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, first off, the sirens went off for incoming missiles that never in came. Then when they need sirens, they don't use them.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like in a nuclear disaster, you're supposed to go to a higher ground.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, there's something -- there's a lot of stuff going on here, including, like, why they waited on releasing the water and stuff like that. And a lot of it has to do with ideology. It sounds like and when one ideology becomes the overarching principle, then all the other problems underneath it become less vital, right? So, you have 111 people right now I think have died. Right?</p><p>But let's focus on climate change. You see what happens there. It's like, you have this horrible problem, all of these people died. But keep your eye on the big picture. The big picture is climate change, you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet. This is what they -- this is exactly the ideology behind people starving to death in USSR, dying in China. It's like focus on the revolution, focus on the great promise of communism, the Great Leap Forward, just keep it -- who cares if people are dying.</p><p>We have stupidly made all the problems, whether it's in -- you'll see it, education, and crime and the border, and most of all mental health, secondary to climate. And the irony of this is that issue is causing mental health problems.</p><p>But the issue is now the problem. And yet, if you point out, a lot of people are suffering severe anxiety due to all this climate change hysteria, it's like, focus, focus on climate, ignore the fact that people are going crazy.</p><p>PERINO: So, I was thinking about this, Charlie, you and I have known each other since like, the late 90s. And we were both involved in media and I was on the Republican side of politics, you've been in journalism the whole time. And to watch the evolution of this since about 1993, 94, 95 to where we are today, it is pretty stunning. They are just absolutely relentless on the messaging.</p><p>HURT: Yes. And, you know, often usually, when Democrats talk about climate change, they're talking about that, because they don't want to talk about something else, such as failed policies, or the idea that they have no ideas or no solutions to the problems facing.</p><p>But as here in Maui, the problem, it's not some amorphous thing, it's physics. If you have power lines that are jangling all around, and you have an -- you have cluttered dry grass underneath, that doesn't get cut, because the power companies have diverted all of their money over to green energy proposals pie in the sky nonsense, then, of course, you're going to have wildfires.</p><p>And the idea of the thing about the sirens, and I want to be careful about speculating too much, because of course, there's 1,300 people that are still unaccounted for right now. Many of them were probably children, and we have no idea what we're going to find. And I think that all the speculation has to be tempered a little bit.</p><p>But the idea that people -- the sirens are going to go off and they're going to walk out of their houses and then run into a fire just seems to be kind of insulting to people. Usually, people will do anything, even on the, you know, 90th floor of a building, they will go away from the fire if they walk -- even a child, if they walk outside and they see that.</p><p>So, I find that very disingenuous, but John Podesta sit there in the White House and exploit this more shamelessly than Democrats exploit school shootings, to push their creepy gun agenda. It's -- and it's -- and they never get called on it. They're not apologizing for it. And I don't think it's going to quit because it works.</p><p>PERINO: Judge, you -- I hadn't thought about that.</p><p>PIRRO: I was agreeing with him. You know, it's not just relentless on the messaging. I mean, the climate change is the scapegoat.</p><p>Apparently, in 2019, they had some of the worst fires. And they had -- they did a study and they decided they needed to do more to prevent the power lines from emitting sparks, which would then cause these fires.</p><p>So, they didn't put the plan in place. Instead, what they did was they invested in renewable energy in green energy.</p><p>And as a result, there was no plan which is basically turning the power off, if there is a significant wildfire risk, and they need to have that plan in place. They didn't.</p><p>But let me tell you what climate change is responsible for, the new scapegoat. Climate change is responsible for hate speech. It is -- climate change is responsible and it has an effect on the babies in the womb. Climate change is to blame for rising childhood obesity, for strengthening ISIS, the Taliban, it will cause murders, rapes and assaults arise. Screenwriter says climate change could cause real-life sharknado and it goes on and on.</p><p>I mean, come on, deal with the facts. You don't want to take the blame. You stand there and say that you shouldn't have turned on the sirens, that's just outrageous, enough with no excuses.</p><p>PERINO: There's just another one. Another example is a Canadian wildfires from this summer. And so, then when the smoke came down to New England, everyone's like, oh my gosh, the climate change is so bad.</p><p>But then like, could you just give us a second to explain forest fire manage -- forest management? And the ways to deal with this? It's not -- I'm not saying climate change isn't real. I'm saying it's not the only reason that you have this. Plus, a lot of these fires, when you trace it back, they're started by humans, it's started by arson. That's just my TED talk. Let me give you the last word, Jessica, any of this, any at all.</p><p>TARLOV: There's so much.</p><p>GUTFELD: Are you pro-fire?</p><p>TARLOV: Definitely not. And I'm very pro-Hawaii. And this is incredibly different than a normal liberal bastion that you wouldn't be talking about.</p><p>Hawaii is literally paradise, right? This is a well-managed state where people are happy there. It's like the Denmark of America, right? People who are indigenous to being there, people who travel there. It's a wonderful place that is typically well-managed.</p><p>And I don't think that it's part of the liberal agenda to let an electric company off the hook. We hate big business too, right?</p><p>So, we're not like predisposed to love Hawaiian Electric, or whatever it was called. And obviously, there was a mismanagement of the problem. But that did collide with drought conditions, the soil wasn't just dry. It was drier than normal. And then hurricane Dora was stronger than normal, those winds that picked up the electrical short-circuiting is what made it a disaster of this proportion. And that's why Lahaina is gone, which is a complete travesty there.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think you can make that that. There's a lot of possibilities in that linkage. And I think there's a few holes in it right there. But I'll let you go.</p><p>TARLOV: I appreciate that.</p><p>PERINO: But also, there's all this money, this climate change money is not going to the adaptations, right? So, let's -- OK, let's shore up the power lines then, let's shore up things. And none of that is happening anywhere. It's not even happening in New York.</p><p>TARLOV: But there seems to be, or at least, the vibe that I'm getting from the table, that there's a refusal, and you said, I'm not saying that climate change isn't real, but it is an important piece of this puzzle.</p><p>I mean, we have these record heat waves and the leaders of Republican states in the last month have all been on T.V. talking about it, the precautions they have to take that they're making sure that there's water available to people, like it's real.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HURT: But also, I don't think that people are suggesting that this was intentional, it's that you get blinded by this ideology, like the green agenda in the power companies, and then you don't take care of the important business that ends up causing catastrophe.</p><p>GUTFELD: Think about this big, stupid bill, the Inflation Reduction Act that was really a climate bill, what that could have done for so many people if they weren't so delusional about climate?</p><p>PIRRO: And if a company is engaging in a dereliction of duty, and not shutting down the power lines, where they actually have videos of every time that power line hit the ground, the spark started. I mean, that's pretty obvious.</p><p>TARLOV: I don't think anyone is disagreeing with that. It's just the point that these things can coexist, that there is a climate change problem and there was a mismanagement of this problem that has led to a complete tragedy.</p><p>PERINO: OK. We'll buy that.</p><p>All right, ahead, President Biden daring Americans to name a single thing he's failed at doing. I think we might be able to come up with a few, we'll tell you when we get back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Get ready for your head to explode. Joe Biden thinks his presidency is a smashing success.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no quit in America. Name me a single objective we've ever set out to accomplish that we've failed on. Name me one. In all of our history, not one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Challenge accepted, Mr. President. How about your border crisis? Democrats in the sanctuary state of New York are taking shots at one another over who's to blame for the spiraling migrant crisis? Governor Kathy Hochul sending a scathing 12-page letter that rips New York City Mayor Eric Adam over his management and failing to properly use the state's resources, but the Democrat mayor firing right back at her.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC ADAMS, MAYOR, NEW YORK CITY: We're hoping that the governor will put in place an executive order that will prevent us from having to go from location to location to location. New York just cannot continue to take this flow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: OK, Greg, isn't this what happens when you declare yourself a sanctuary city and a sanctuary state? And is this the beginning of the implosion of Democrat lawmakers in New York?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. I mean, at first, I got to like -- I got to defend Biden. He was talking about history. So, it wasn't necessarily about him. But that -- he was using that, I believe, as a camouflage against all the problems, which are the border, crime, education, mental health, supporting billions into a war while not helping out the folks in Hawaii, and also not uniting the country, which is what he was elected to do and so far has been doing nothing but divide them.</p><p>But I still find that troubling because he's not well. I mean, I'm sorry that screaming like that irrationally -- and you know, I never scream on this show. I usually try to keep myself -- I try to keep America calm.</p><p>PERINO: It's always rational.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's always rational. But he like there's something going on there. The Democrats can't admit this openly. They need to get him off the ticket. But as long as Kamala is there, that means their choice for V.P. for now forces the P to stay put. Because you can't get rid of him if she's still hanging around. You know, no one wants Joe for another term, much less for four or five months. But the only thing worse is that chuckling gas bag. So, it's like they don't know what to do. They're in -- they're in a tight little corner. That's why Gavin is licking his chops.</p><p>PERINO: He is.</p><p>PIRRO: Oh, yes. All right, Dana. To name a few of Biden's accomplishments, let's talk about the border, Afghanistan, the polarization, cost of living, energy dependence, and yet in his mind, he's batting 1,000.</p><p>PERINO: You forgot one other thing. My biggest pet peeve right now is the national education scores through K through 12 education.</p><p>PIRRO: Sure.</p><p>PERINO: Everything is down. And I'm not saying it's all late at his feet, but COVID was a huge problem. They refused to acknowledge it. And they continue to back the teachers unions on all of that. And they won't acknowledge the fact that this is a huge crisis. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, when she was on \"NEWSROOM,\" she said these test scores in K through 12 education are a national humiliation.</p><p>So, one of the things I would say, do you think that you have a responsibility as president about the education of America's children? I'm just curious. Like, do you think that's just something that you should ignore? What about all these people we just talked about who are living on the street that just increases? We have an 11 percent homelessness increase year over year. And that's an undercount. We forgot we didn't talk about the baby formula issue, Afghanistan. I mean, there's plenty of things.</p><p>A lot of the things I would say, though, that he considers accomplishments. Like, he's passed more bills than Obama. OK, great. But a lot of his accomplishments are vulnerabilities. And one of them, he admitted this week. He wishes that he had called the Inflation Reduction Act something else because it was supposed -- it wasn't that. It was meant to deal with climate change, which we just talked about. But he has a 60 percent disapproval on climate change and he has a 36 percent approval on the economy. So, his accomplishments, as he sees them, are also vulnerabilities, if I can get that word out.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know, Charlie, I mean, when Dana talks about the education system, the mess that we're in right now, we are in an embarrassing situation, I mean, compared to many other countries. Now we've got the migrants' kids, the illegal aliens are bringing their kids in, and then these local school districts have to hire teachers who speak not just Spanish, but some people are from Africa, Pakistan, India. What do we do about that?</p><p>HURT: Well, so like what we were saying earlier, so much of it is just basic competence. I mean, these are real problems that are going to come about that people are going to have to deal with. And it's going to be an impossible problem, as we've seen, which is why -- which is why people like Mayor Adams are now shuttling migrants north.</p><p>But I also -- I love your generous -- generosity towards --</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, thank you.</p><p>HURT: -- yes, towards Biden talking about the history. And yes, maybe he was kind of talking about American history, but what's really funny about this is that maybe we did everything right before --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>HURT: -- but now all of the problems -- and I came up with a long list of them, and you mentioned a lot of them, all of them happened under his watch. And whether --</p><p>GUTFELD: That's why he did the history thing.</p><p>HURT: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: He added that in the end. He goes, in history.</p><p>HURT: But it just goes on and on. And obviously, the unifying the country was like the really big one, because that is such a disaster. It turns out that calling half the country Nazis is probably not a really good way to do it. But it reminds me of -- do you remember the Simpsons episode where the county of Springfield declared Jimmy Carter history's monster? We have a new history, we have a new monster.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Jessica, now Mayor Adams says the cost of paying for these migrants is going to exceed $12 billion.</p><p>TARLOV: Right.</p><p>PIRRO: You're a New York City taxpayer. How do you feel about that?</p><p>TARLOV: I think the federal government better pony up for this, and that it's on them at this point. I think that it's important for us to remain a sanctuary city. There's good reason to be sanctuary cities, and there are a lot of Republicans throughout history --</p><p>PIRRO: Didn't Mayor Adams -- didn't Mayor Adams say he doesn't want to be a sanctuary city anymore? He actually came out and said that.</p><p>TARLOV: No, he -- no, he said that he wants this dealt with. I don't think that he said --</p><p>PIRRO: He did. He came out and said he's sorry about the sanctuary --</p><p>HURT: So, you'll spend -- you're a build the wall -- spend money on the wall Democrat?</p><p>TARLOV: No, pony up and pay for the migrants that are here. The federal government --</p><p>GUTFELD: Which is -- which is an incentive.</p><p>PIRRO: And spend your federal taxes.</p><p>TARLOV: It's not their -- so the people who are here, they are registered in the system through the CBP One app.</p><p>HURT: Some of them.</p><p>TARLOV: No, well, it's pretty far to get -- the people who got on the buses, right, the Governor Abbott's buses, Ducey's buses, DeSantis's buses, whatever, those are all people that are registered in the system. That's how that works. You couldn't get on those buses without it.</p><p>PIRRO: That's right.</p><p>TARLOV: So, we know who they are. They have court dates.</p><p>GUTFELD: Seven years from now?</p><p>TARLOV: Some of them, yes. But we have a long history of having undocumented people here who are a tremendous boon, not only for our economy, but our society.</p><p>GUTFELD: We're not arguing that. That's always a straw man argument. We love immigrants. We just want a system that works that you can have both. Why not -- for example, if you're saying that the federal has to pony up, what you're saying is continue to provide the incentives that have people cross illegally.</p><p>TARLOV: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: What we're saying is we love -- by the way, we're not reproducing, we need help. We need people here. I mean, that's the hard truth. But the point is, you've got to do it through a process.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know what? Mayor Adams gave a no bid contract to an organization called DocGo, gave them $432 million that you're paying for to place all these illegals in counties of state, which is what they criticized the Republican governors for doing. And now they're doing the same thing. Are they now inhumane, racists, and all the other stuff.</p><p>TARLOV: I didn't use that kind of terminology. I said it was a stunt. And Mayor Adams does enjoy a stunt himself.</p><p>PIRRO: Is that a stunt?</p><p>TARLOV: He's a showman. And that's part of why people like him.</p><p>PIRRO: OK. Up next, California's slick governor is letting the hair gel screw with his brain again. Gavin Newsom blasting parents as brainwashed by the right.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HURT: So, California's Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom inserting himself in the middle of a national debate over parental rights. Newsom is bashing parents as his state -- in his state as being brainwashed by the right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): There is no state in America that supports local control and parental engagement like the State of California. No one comes close. It's written into our rules. That's parental engagement by definition. I don't know what it is they're certain. It's Orwellian, double-speak, or it's just so profoundly ignorant that they've been ginned up outside agitators, which I think perhaps is a combination of this.</p><p>And I'm deeply empathetic because I watch some of these poor parents, and they've been so misled by these organized groups.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HURT: Judge, how condescending is this? And is this effective in politics?</p><p>PIRRO: You know, I think he heard himself with that. You know, I mean, people are starting to have a good feeling about this guy. He is a real ideologue. You know, these parents are being brainwashed by these ideological groups, OK. Really, you think parents are dumb? You know, maybe they are. They voted for you. But that's a whole other issue.</p><p>I honestly think that, you know, this guy is using his powder against DeSantis. He ought to be using it against Youngkin because I see Youngkin on the same plane and fighting with him on this issue. The bottom line is they are crafting legislation to prevent parents from finding out if a child wants to change a gender identity. And you know what? That is just none of the school's business. And he's not going to win on that.</p><p>HURT: Jess, do you think it's effective?</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, I do think it's effective. I think that he was striking a balance between -- he was talking about extremist parents and extremist groups. Like, we've just got a step before. I'm not calling them terrorists, but over half of the book bands or the removal of certain pieces of literature from libraries was because of petitions for members of the Moms for Liberty group. That's just a fact.</p><p>GUTFELD: Which ones?</p><p>TARLOV: We have to do this again?</p><p>GUTFELD: We only have a minute left. Why do we have to do this?</p><p>TARLOV: To irritate you.</p><p>GUTFELD: I want to know the book. I want to know every one of them.</p><p>TARLOV: It doesn't --</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't matter.</p><p>TARLOV: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK, forget it then. Don't bring it up.</p><p>TARLOV: No, every one of them. Fine, let's talk about Judy Blume again. Let's talk about --</p><p>PIRRO: They have pornographic imagery in those books.</p><p>TARLOV: Not all of them.</p><p>GUTFELD: Judy Blume wasn't banned.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: She was moved. You moved books isn't banding.</p><p>TARLOV: But that -- but parents -- 51 percent of Republican parents, in fact, are against that. 51 percent of Republican.</p><p>HURT: But they also, they were books that --</p><p>PIRRO: What's the question?</p><p>HURT: Parents went to the school board and tried to read --</p><p>TARLOV: Get Dana in. parents from an organization --</p><p>HURT: -- and the school board wouldn't let it in. But Dana, you know, big picture. You know, Glenn Youngkin went into Virginia, a Democrat state now, and completely eight Democrats lunch on the most Democrat issue there is combating exactly --</p><p>PERINO: Do you know who should be most mad about this, is Joe Biden. Because Gavin Newsom is so obviously running for president. He's trying to rebrand himself as a Governor Youngkin or a Ron DeSantis or a Sarah Huckabee Sanders because he's saying, oh, they have an 80 percent approval rating when it comes to parents. That's what he's trying to do.</p><p>HURT: You don't have kids, but I mean, if you're a kids --</p><p>GUTFELD: How do you know that?</p><p>HURT: Well, whatever.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, don't jump to conclusions.</p><p>But if your kids are sitting there talking about -- worrying about their pronouns, does that maybe mean they're not learning something in school?</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what? Telling parents how to feel is different than listening to them. He's just telling them how they should feel. And he should also admit that he would never let a teacher and activist get between him and his kids. That's -- is that extreme? That's the simplest thing he should answer. But I bet he can't because he's terrified of the activists. And he is running for president.</p><p>HURT: True. OK, up next, divorce me baby one more time. I can't believe I just said that.</p><p>TARLOV: I can't either.</p><p>HURT: Some major drama as Brit Brit and her hubby head for Splitsville.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TARLOV: Britney Spears and husband Sam Asghari are reportedly getting divorced after only one year. Sam filing the paperwork after rumors that Spears was cheating on him. And things could get ugly. Page Six claims that Sam is \"threatening to release extraordinarily embarrassing Britney Spears info if their prenup is not renegotiated.\" But Spears is still living her life. She posted that she's buying a horse.</p><p>We have like no time as opposed to only say your names. Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. OK, so I blame the media who pushed this free Britneycrap when clearly she still have very, very serious mental issues. Don't get your opinions from Cody Rigsby, Dana. I've said that many times. Britney fans, just because you're a Britney fan, doesn't mean you know what her mental state really is.</p><p>TARLOV: Dana?</p><p>PERINO: I would say she used a lot of emojis in that text. A lot. That's all I got.</p><p>TARLOV: OK.</p><p>HURT: I have virtually no opinion whatsoever about any of this, except I was shocked to learn that she is worth about $60 million.</p><p>GUTFELD: You think it'd be more?</p><p>TARLOV: Well, that's --</p><p>HURT: Oh, my God.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes.</p><p>TARLOV: That's part of the problem with the conservatorship, that they mismanaged her.</p><p>HURT: You would think that she was --</p><p>PIRRO: That's why they broke the conservatorship because of the father. You want to know what I think?</p><p>TARLOV: I do. Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: I think just saying -- thank you. I think he's saying that he's going to expose embarrassing stuff if she doesn't renegotiate the prenup. I looked under the California law, and it could be, and I'm not saying that it is, but it is against the law to expose a secret affecting him, her, or them. It might constitute extortion.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, there we go.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes. That would be exciting.</p><p>PERINO: Good point.</p><p>GUTFELD: We have a new song title, Extortion.</p><p>HURT: Wow.</p><p>PERINO: Boom, boom.</p><p>TARLOV: OK. \"ONE MORE THING\" is up next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Extortion.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: \"ONE MORE THING.\" All right, tonight, what a show. Oh, my goodness. We got Todd Piro. You don't know him because you're not up that early. Batya Ungar-Sargon, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. This is going to be a great show. Hey, let's do this. Greg's Trip To The Zoo. I love going to the zoo. But don't make the mistake I did and drink a 12-pack of beer before going to see the elephants.</p><p>PERINO: That's disgusting. You're horrible. Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: Actually, that's just a baby elephant --</p><p>TARLOV: I just figure it out.</p><p>PERINO: You are incredible.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- drinking some water. I couldn't resist the joke. Dana?</p><p>PERINO: All right, I have Short Questions this week is with Brian Kilmeade, and Greg can't wait to read all of that for sure.</p><p>Also, there was a pair of Colorado travelers that experience a love-it- first flight. They were seated next to each other on a trip to London back in April of 2022. Sasha says she felt like that's going to be her husband just an hour into the flight. And the couple actually ran into each other while in Scottland. And now, guess what? Eight months later, they are engaged and they are said to get married this weekend.</p><p>I tell you this because it happened before --</p><p>PIRRO: You.</p><p>PERINO: -- 26 years ago today, I met Peter on the airplane.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>PERINO: Happy anniversary.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not something to joke about.</p><p>TARLOV: Happy meeting you.</p><p>PIRRO: Great picture.</p><p>PERINO: And now we have Erin as our child. It's what it looks like. Erin is not our child. She's just a friend.</p><p>GUTFELD: Are we sure? Judge?</p><p>PIRRO: OK, so a golden retriever was caught red-pawed hopping over the backyard fence to take a quick dip into his neighbor's pool. The owner said he had gotten into the neighbor's pool previously the same week, but they didn't know how, so they set up a camera. And they said he doesn't have to hide. He's welcome to come by any time and swim. It doesn't have to be a sneak.</p><p>PERINO: It's so cute.</p><p>PIRRO: Pretty smart.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>PERINO: I love it.</p><p>PIRRO: Jumping over the fence to get in the pool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Amazing animals, Jessica.</p><p>TARLOV: Indeed. So, superstar Ed Sheeran spotted putting in a shift at the Lego Store at the Mall of America ahead of his Minneapolis show. The red- headed artist took his new job very seriously, signing all the Lego boxes, handing out gifts and concert tickets. And at the end of his shift, pulled out the guitar and performed an acoustic version of his hit song, Lego House.</p><p>PERINO: You go, boy.</p><p>PIRRO: That's nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, it is nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's good to see the homeless doing good.

In countries with low vaccination coverage, the situation is particularly bad.</p><p>The WHO chief said the world is experiencing a worsening public health emergency that further threatens lives, livelihoods and the world economy. He said it is worse in places with few vaccines, but the pandemic is not over anywhere. The global vaccine inequity is making it worse, he said.</p><p>Tedros compared the current global strategy for fighting the pandemic to fighting a forest fire.</p><p>\"Hosing down part of it might reduce the flames in one area, but while it's smoldering anywhere, sparks will eventually travel and grow again into a roaring furnace. The world should battle together to put out this pandemic inferno everywhere. \"</p><p>Mike Ryan, WHO health emergencies program executive director, also said events in regions with a certain level of vaccination such as the just-concluded 2020 soccer tournament that featured soccer stadiums at least partially full of fans make it more difficult for nations that need to implement COVID-19 restrictions they need.</p><p>\"It's more difficult for governments in those situations, in those countries, to continue to implement public health and social measures because their populations are looking at this and saying, 'Hey, it's all over in Europe. I mean, maybe it's all over here.'\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Tedros chastised wealthy nations with high vaccination rates and vaccine producers Pfizer and Moderna for considering booster shots while other countries lack the supplies to vaccinate their health workers and the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"Currently, data shows us that vaccination offers long-lasting immunity against severe and deadly COVID-19. The priority now must be to vaccinate those who have received no doses and protection,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124576421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634F-85K1-JCBF-S4JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Currently, the fire is a low intensity surface fire, burning primarily in the dead-and-down fuels. Carson National Forest fire managers are taking advantage of ideal conditions to manage the fire for resource benefit and resiliency in a high-priority watershed. The Poso fire poses no immediate danger to any property or infrastructure.</p><p>Name: Poso</p><p>Date detected: May 29, 2021</p><p>Cause: Lightning</p><p>Location: Carson NF, El Rito Ranger District, adjacent to FR123</p><p>Size: 7 acres</p><p>Growth Potential: Low to moderate</p><p>Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer</p><p>Resources: 1 Type-4 Incident Command Team, 1 road grader, 2 Type-6 engines, local fire personnel.</p><p>In Route: 1 Type-2 bulldozer, 1 Type-1 masticator, and 1 wildland fire module.</p><p>Gradual fire growth can be expected as the fire creeps naturally, but residents and travelers can expect the volume of smoke to increase over the next few weeks as firefighters enter the area and increase burning activity in order to mimic natural fire conditions. Pre-determined management areas have been and will continue to be identified as the fire continues to burn, so that it can be kept within established boundaries. Previous treatments in the area may assist managers by providing a good area to limit the fire's spread. Additional management actions, including burning (both ground and aerial ignitions) in the next several days, will be further determined by fire activity, weather, and the progression of the fire.</p><p>The Carson National Forest is committed to using lightning-caused fires when conditions allow to achieve many resource objectives. Fire mangers use a strategy which incorporates different tactics to accomplish desired results. These tactics help reduce firefighter exposure while increasing the probability of meeting predetermined desired effects in relationship to values at risk. This assists the Forest in meeting the land management objective of returning natural fire back into this fire-adapted ecosystem.</p><p>Due to the location and elevation of the fires, smoke may be visible from surrounding communities including Vallecitos, Canon Plaza, Petaca, Las Tablas, Servilleta Plaza, El Rito, Ojo Caliente, Tres Piedras, and La Madera, New Mexico. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with heart or respiratory problems are encouraged to take precautionary measures.

The deliveries of emergency drinking water in New Hampshire will help address this critical need, while supporting a community that Anheuser-Busch's Merrimack brewery is proud to call home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Anheuser-Busch is a dedicated community partner here in New Hampshire, lifting up our first responders and frontline workers as they serve our state and keep us safe,\" saidRepresentative Annie Kuster.\"I appreciate Anheuser-Busch's emergency drinking water program to support our Granite State firefighters as they work to protect our communities.\"</p><p>\"The Anheuser-Busch and National Volunteer Fire Council Emergency Drinking Water for Wildland Firefighters program is a valuable resource for New Hampshire fire departments.\u00a0 Wildfire suppression is labor intensive and is done during hot, dry weather and in rugged terrain so staying hydrated is key for safe and successful fire suppression operations. We appreciate the continued support of Anheuser-Busch and the National Volunteer Fire Council and their work to keep New Hampshire firefighters safe,\"said Steven Sherman, Chief and Forest Fire Supervisor, New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau.</p><p>\"Thank you to Anheuser-Busch and the National Volunteer Fire Council for their continued support of New Hampshire fire departments through the Emergency Drinking Water for Wildland Firefighters program.

Toomey, P.E., New Hampshire State Fire Marshal's Office (FMO).</p><p>This year's partnership between Anheuser-Busch and the NVFC will provide more than 1.5 million cans of emergency drinking water to nearly 450 volunteer fire departments across 46 states. It also marks a significant continuation of the brewer's 30-year-strong commitment to disaster relief and supporting local communities in times of need through its emergency drinking water program.</p><p>\"Our emergency drinking water program is a tremendous source of pride for all of us at Anheuser-Busch \u2013 including our nearly 400 employees across New Hampshire \u2013 as we are able to do our part to recognize and support the heroes who protect our communities from natural disasters,\"said Colleen Lucas, Vice President of Community Impact at Anheuser-Busch. \"By leveraging our production and distribution capabilities as a force of good, we are honored to lend a hand to New Hampshire's volunteer fire service and first responders across the country.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"Hydration is a vital component to firefighter health and safety, and an important part of keeping firefighters functioning at their best during response,\"said NVFC Chair Steve Hirsch.\"We appreciate Anheuser-Busch's ongoing commitment to support our volunteer boots-on-the-ground responders. This is an invaluable program that provides a critical resource to volunteer departments, so they can use their limited budgets on other necessities.\"\u00a0</p><p>In New Hampshire, the donations of emergency drinking water will be made to Lyndeborough Fire Department, Sandown Fire-Rescue, New Boston Fire Department, Croydon Volunteer Fire Department, Wilton Fire Department, Plainfield Fire Department, Charlestown Fire Department, Gorham Fire and EMS, East Kingston Fire Department, Lancaster Fire Department and Shelburne Fire Department.</p><p>Since 2019, Anheuser-Busch and its national network of independent wholesalers \u2013\u00a0including local partners, Bellavance Beverage Co. and New Hampshire Distributors Inc \u2013\u00a0have partnered with the NVFC to\u00a0donate more than 4.9 million cans of clean, safe drinking water to more than 960 fire departments across the country to support wildfire response needs.</p><p>\"We are proud to facilitate Anheuser-Busch's emergency drinking water initiative at the local level. It isn't every day that we get to make special deliveries like these, and our delivery team embraced the opportunity to make it happen and meet our community heroes. It is important to let our volunteer firefighters know that we are grateful for all they do and that we support them as they work to protect our communities,\"said Chelsea Dennis, Marketing Manager at Bellavance Beverage Co.</p><p>The donations of emergency drinking water are sourced from Anheuser-Busch's breweries in Cartersville, Georgia and Fort Collins, Colorado which periodically pause beer production to can emergency drinking water to support disaster relief efforts in partnership with the American Red Cross and the NVFC.

The national wildfire preparedness level is at 5 (PL5), the highest level of wildland fire activity with several large, complex wildland fires and at least 80% of the country's firefighting resources committed to wildland fire incidents. New Mexico and Arizona are currently at PL2, experiencing high to extreme fire danger but able to manage fire activity with resources on hand.</p><p>A final decision on whether to proceed with a specific prescribed burn on the SFNF will depend on multiple conditions, including the national wildland fire preparedness level and resource availability, fuel moisture levels, air quality and forecasted weather. Prescribed burns are designed to meet specific objectives and are always managed with firefighter and public safety as the first priority.</p><p>Carson National Forest fire managers have prioritized their prescribed fire projects by district. All of the following projects have been cleared under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p>East Zone - Carson National Forest:</p><p>* La Jara Rx, 1,301-acre broadcast burn near Angel Fire, New Mexico</p><p>* Apache Rx, 501-acre acre broadcast burn near Angel Fire, New Mexico</p><p>* Valle Vidal Hart Canyon Rx, 6,529-acre broadcast burn approximately 19 miles northwest of Cimarron, New Mexico and 16 miles northeast of Ute Park, New Mexico.</p><p>* KSC Jackpot Rx, 120-acre jackpot burn near San Cristobal, New Mexico</p><p>* Taos Ski Valley Piles Rx, 150-acre pile burn near Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico</p><p>West Zone - Carson National Forest:</p><p>* Canjilon Lakes Piles, 186-acre pile burn at Canjilon Lakes Campground</p><p>* Tio Gordito Piles, 152-acre pile burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>* Willow Piles, 250-acre pile burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>* Ensenada, 1,243-acre broadcast burn near El Rito, New Mexico</p><p>* Tio Gordito 7&amp;8, 3,319-acre broadcast burn near Tres Piedras, New Mexico</p><p>The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) reports that this year to date, the U.S. has had 44,461 wildfires that have burned a total of 5,567,600 acres. Today, NIFC reports 81 active large fires with 21,862 personnel assigned. As fire seasons become more severe, the need for and efficacy of fuels treatments becomes clearer.</p><p>The Forest Service's land management strategy is centered on long-term forest health, which includes reducing forest fuels and using prescribed fire on the landscape. A healthy forest is a resilient forest that undergoes fire occurrences on a regular basis. The Carson National Forest works with partners, collaborators, and communities to clearly identify objectives and address concerns during the planning process for prescribed fires.</p><p>The Forest manages prescribed fires in compliance with New Mexico state regulations on air quality and smoke management. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory problems or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures.
