TOA Systems, Inc. is a premier provider of lightning detection hardware and one of the few global lightning networks in existence. The announcement was made at the American Meteorological Society's Annual Meeting 2025 in New Orleans. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/150460/accuweather_logo.jpg\"/> \"The integration of AccuWeather's expertise in machine learning and weather forecasting with TOA's advanced hardware will dramatically enhance decision-making processes for industries and individuals at risk from lightning strikes.\" Steven R. Smith, AccuWeather CEOThe new<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AccuWeather Lightning Network</emphasis>\u2122 will enhance global lightning detection capabilities by combining AccuWeather's proven Superior Accuracy\u2122 in weather forecasting with TOA's state-of-the-art hardware network to keep people safer and businesses, property, and assets better protected.The deal was closed in December of 2024 and is AccuWeather's 16th acquisition since its founding 63 years ago. The integration of TOA's advanced lightning detection systems with AccuWeather's proprietary forecasting technology and machine learning expertise will create a comprehensive, one-of-a-kind global lightning detection network to deliver superior value to businesses, governments, and the public, helping them better manage risks and better understand the impact of lightning. AccuWeather's actionable insights enable the best decisions with real-time lightning data, SkyGuard\u00ae warnings for lightning, lightning reports, and historical lightning data.\"We are genuinely thrilled about this meaningful and powerful opportunity to not only advance our lightning forecast expertise, but also to provide a critical, life-saving dataset, and cutting-edge lightning sensing technology to AccuWeather clients and users worldwide,\" said Steven R. Smith, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and member of the Board of Directors of AccuWeather. \"The integration of AccuWeather's expertise in machine learning and weather forecasting with TOA's advanced hardware will dramatically enhance decision-making processes for industries and individuals at risk from lightning strikes.\"In the United States, lightning is a significant weather hazard striking the ground over 200 million times (over 2 billion times globally) last year. On average, lightning causes 20-30 fatalities and over 200 injuries annually in the U.S. Globally, the toll is even larger, with some estimates of more than 10,000 lives lost each year due to lightning. AccuWeather said this strategic acquisition will enable the company to offer real-time lightning detection services that further enhance safety and preparedness.\"TOA Systems has been at the forefront of lightning detection technology, providing reliable and precise data to various sectors, including aviation, energy, and outdoor event management,\" said Chris Patti, Chief Data and Science Officer at AccuWeather. \"By leveraging AccuWeather's advanced forecasting algorithms, innovative machine learning models and deploying sensors across North America, and then the rest of the world the new<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AccuWeather Lightning Network\u2122</emphasis>will deliver enhanced predictive insights and lightning risk assessments.\"Said Tim Bent, formerly of TOA Systems, \"This is a significant advancement in the field of meteorology and lightning detection. Our integration with AccuWeather will expand the reach and accuracy of our lightning detection network, providing critical, life-saving information to a global audience.\"A typical lightning bolt carries around 300 million volts and 30,000 amps of electricity, making it extremely powerful compared to household current, which is around 120 volts and 15 amps; essentially, an average lightning bolt packs a punch of about 1 billion joules of energy.Lightning strikes have a substantial economic impact, causing an estimated $1 billion in total economic loss each year in the U.S. due to property damage, forest fire spread, and infrastructure disruptions. Lightning-related fires, electrical surges, and damage to infrastructure, such as power lines and buildings, contribute significantly to these costs (U.S. Fire Administration, 2020). The agricultural sector bears a considerable share of the financial burden, with lightning-induced wildfires and damage to crops and livestock leading to losses that extend beyond the immediate destruction (National Interagency Fire Center, 2021).Additionally, power outages resulting from lightning strikes disrupt businesses, leading to economic losses in productivity. The cost to insurance companies also rises, driving up premiums for affected homeowners and businesses (Insurance Information Institute, 2020).The new global lightning detection network will be integrated into AccuWeather's suite of digital platforms, including AccuWeather.com and mobile apps, making it easily accessible to users.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The AccuWeather Lightning Network</emphasis>\u2122 will also provide real-time lightning alerts, detailed risk analysis, and safety recommendations tailored to specific locations designed for enterprise and business clients.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AccuWeather Lightning Network</emphasis>\u2122 data will also be available via AccuWeather's APIs and Data Marketplaces (Databricks + Snowflake).For more information on this acquisition, high resolution lightning images, or to access the enhanced lightning detection services, visitAccuWeather.comor contact .<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About AccuWeather</emphasis>AccuWeather, recognized and documented as the most accurate and most used source of weather forecasts and warnings in the world, has saved over 12,000 lives, prevented injury to over 100,000 people, and saved companies tens of billions of dollars through better planning and decision-making.

I was checking my family's location. I was texting them and they weren't responding, and it was nerve-wracking,\" Berger said. \"I didn't know if they were okay, (and) I didn't know if our house was okay.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Berger's family had left their house in Altadena to stay with her grandparents - whose house is close to the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena\u00a0 - they received a second evacuation order the very same night and had to flee again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Berger's father drove up to the evacuated neighborhood and put out some of the embers from the main fire, in an attempt to prevent further fires from igniting.\u00a0</p><p>Berger recalled that her neighborhood had around 180 houses, of which 50 had burned down.\u00a0</p><p>Her grandparent's home was one of them. They had lost everything.\u00a0</p><p>Berger received this news in the form of a text message from her sister during class.</p><p>\"She's (Berger's grandmother) like a big sentimental person. All of the family things, photos and everything was in her house that burned ... she's being very strong about it, \" Berger said, recalling how her grandmother is currently handling the devastating news.</p><p>\"An entire community gone\"</p><p>Hayley Kaufman, a sophomore, said her family lived a bit further from the main fires, but that multiple people from her high school had to evacuate and lost their homes.\u00a0</p><p>Kaufman recalled how devastating the impacts of the fires have been to her community and the memories that had been permanently changed.</p><p>\"It was really scary, the entire first week of school. My hometown is never going to be the same. I'm going to go back, and it's an entire community just gone,\" Kaufman said.</p><p>Penelope Burian, a sophomore, grew up in Altadena and said that many of her childhood friends and family lost their houses and were forced to evacuate to emergency shelters.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"It's hard to focus on school when I have friends from home texting me that their house burned down,\" Burian said. \"For a while, I didn't know who was safe and who wasn't because they didn't have power.\"</p><p>Jessica Yang, a transfer student and a senior at UO, grew up in Irvine, a city south of the fires but still heavily impacted by unhealthy levels of smoke. Growing up in the area, she knew many people affected by the fires.\u00a0</p><p>Yang said that one of her friends had to evacuate due to health conditions worsening from the smoke. Many of her friends from summer camp went to Palisades High School, which was completely burned down by the fires.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's been a tough spot to navigate for me, I'm near all of this tragedy peripherally but I'm not experiencing it in the same way my friends are, but it feels like there's not much I can do to help other than listening to them,\" Yang said.</p><p>Yang said she also is doing what she can by donating to different Go-Fund-Mes for her friends and those who have been impacted.</p><p>Minimal fire prevention efforts led to the fires</p><p>The Los Angeles fires are being labeled as one of the \"worst\" catastrophes in the US, with the fires claiming at least 24 lives, destroying 12,000 structures homes being completely burnt, leaving\u00a0 thousands without power and preliminary projected damage costs of over $150 billion, as of Jan. 14.\u00a0</p><p>The three most prominent fires within the region are the Palisades fire, which burnt 23,713 acres, the Eaton fire, burning 14,000 and the Hurst fire, burning 799.\u00a0</p><p>Investigations are currently being conducted as to the causes of the different fires, but legal cases have been filed against Southern California Edison Company , an electric company, alleging its responsibility for the Eaton fires due to the negligence to de-energize, despite a red-flag warning.</p><p>Multiple factors are making containment of the fires increasingly difficult. First and foremost, the Santa Ana winds have been spreading the wildfires on the hillsides drastically and making preventative efforts minimal.\u00a0</p><p>Southern California has a very particular type of fire ecology and ecosystem, and the overgeneralization of that ecology has often made fire responses haphazard and ill-prepared. Chaparral biomes, characterized by shrublands and hot and dry summers, have crown fires, which burn intensely and infrequently every 30 to 150 years. Unlike forests, chaparral crown fires can't be avoided through usual fire mitigation strategies.\u00a0</p><p>The California Chaparral Institute mentions that the attribution of forest fire preventative tactics, such as slash and burn techniques, have weakened the Chaparral ecosystem and made it prone to catching fire.\u00a0</p><p>Climate change is an undeniable threat to the ecosystem, amplifying intense fires such as the ones currently raging.</p><p>Due to misaligned policies that don't take into account Southern California's natural ecosystem, fire-resistant native ecosystems have been slowly eroded and made the region more prone to devastating fires.</p><p>\"There was a very serious understaffing of (first responders). I remember there being pretty sparse fire stations ... there should be more in an area that's so prone to fires,\" Masha Petrova, an EMT student in Lane County, mentioned after reflecting on her education in emergency services.\u00a0</p><p>Petrova was a resident in the Palisades neighborhood and grew up attending Palisades High School, which was damaged in the Palisades fire. Although Petrova is training in Eugene, her family is located in Brentwood, a 10-minute drive from the fire line.\u00a0</p><p>Due to the damage within the area, Petrova's brother, who was attending Palisades High School, has been on an extended break; the damage within the area has made in-person learning inaccessible, and there have been talks of relocating students to nearby schools or continuing classes online until the end of the year.\u00a0</p><p>\"There have been wildfires in that area before that hadn't been nearly as big and you know that it's temporary, but this (fire) is larger than that, and it pauses life for a second ... living in an area with wildfires and earthquakes (emergency kits) are something people should have but it's often neglected,\" Petrova said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Petrova said the general preparedness skills of people are also limited; having bags of documents, medications, valuables and emergency supplies isn't a common practice in many households, so sudden evacuation orders had left many without important items.</p><p>From afar, students give to those who have lost\u00a0</p><p>Many non-profits, community-based organizations and good samaritans have gotten together to distribute resources to those who have been evacuated or have lost their belongings in the fire, giving those who have lost everything something to rebuild from.\u00a0</p><p>Kat Hernandez, a senior, grew up in downtown LA. Although one of the primary concerns impacting her is the strong winds blowing smoke in the direction of where her family is located, she said that she does have family members working in the valley between the Palisades fire and the Hurst fire and many of them have to come back due to the physical pain they have felt from breathing in smoke.\u00a0</p><p>Her friends have been heavily impacted by the fires, with many of them being evacuated, without working generators or electricity, those being stuck in their homes unable to evacuate, and some with their houses completely burnt down.\u00a0</p><p>Hernandez said, \"Being in Oregon, and not being in LA, it's been difficult. I've been reaching out (to my friends) saying I have all these extra clothes if you need them, (and) my family is there to support you.\"</p><p>\"We're just offering as much help as we can, whether it be staying with us, a case of water, clothing. It's all about community, we're just supporting as much as we can right now,\" Hernandez said.\u00a0</p><p>Even though there are hundreds of miles between LA and Eugene, many students and community members are actively going through devastating losses, and being mindful of how to be supportive is important.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6028103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DY9-60M3-SD15-F163-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Emerald: University of Oregon</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 21, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF OREGON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Eugene</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DVSL</classCode><className>EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000327</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230MM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000327</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS153</classCode><className>OREGON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Ministry has also constituted Central Monitoring Committee (CMC) for overseeing implementation of National Action Plan on Forest Fire.</p><p>The Ministry also supports the efforts of the States/ UTs in prevention and control of forest fire by providing financial assistance. The forest fire prevention and mitigation measures are funded under the Centrally Sponsored Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme, Development of Wildlife Habitats, and under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority. The funds are used for creation and maintenance of fire lines, construction of water conservation structures, procurement of firefighting equipment, awareness creation, and incentivizing villages/communities for protection against forest fire etc. Further, the forest fire prevention and its management is primarily the responsibility of concerned State Governments /UT Administration.</p><p>In the written reply it was stated that the Government has issued advisories to the States to generate awareness among the forest fringe communities to protect the forests from fire from time to time.

According to news reporting out of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Nowadays, there is global consensus on the threats to forests and their crucial role in mitigating global warming and its impact on Earth's biodiversity. Both private and public entities, alongside governments, have engaged the most advanced technologies to safeguard and monitor forests against encroachment.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Sharjah, \"This article examines the application of various drone technologies in the surveillance of forest areas. The system described herein employs drones to continuously survey forests, recording any changes, particularly in instances of encroachment or fire. The data captured are transmitted to a control unit for subsequent analysis. To circumvent the risk of task failure due to technical challenges, monitoring tasks within a predefined flight duration are allocated to the available drones. Given the critical nature of timing in the success of these tasks, this study addresses the forest monitoring challenge by seeking to minimize the maximum time required to complete all monitoring tasks. This challenge was addressed through the development of a suite of enhanced algorithms aimed at optimizing task efficiency. The primary goal of the proposed methodology is to afford the monitoring system additional time, thereby enabling the handling of an increased volume of tasks and providing support to firefighting teams in responding to forest fires. The system's adaptability to new, unforeseen forest fire scenarios through the generation of novel solutions is also discussed. Extensive testing involving 1350 different scenarios has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing the maximum time needed for the completion of surveillance tasks by drones.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The most effective algorithm was the two-group clustering algorithm (TGC), which achieved a success rate of 97.2%, with an average gap of less than 0.001 and an average computation time of 0.016 s. Furthermore, the application of this methodology to a case study of the Daintree Rainforest in Australia showcases the potential and real-world applicability of the proposed system, highlighting its performance and adaptability.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Leveraging Drone-assisted Surveillance for Effective Forest Conservation: a Case Study In Australias Daintree Rainforest.

According to news originating from Nigde Omer Halisdemir University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires in Turkiye are a frequently encountered natural disaster, especially in recent years.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nigde Omer Halisdemir University: \"After a fire, identifying the plant species to be used in the area and determining the intensity of the fire in the region are important for assessing the area's capacity for natural regeneration. In this process, geographic information systems and remote sensing methods and techniques are commonly used tools for assessing burned areas and fire intensities following forest fires. In this study, one of Turkiye's devastating fires, the Marmaris fire, which began on June 21, 2022, is examined. Landsat satellite images, geometrically and radiometrically corrected, were utilized to determine the intensity of the Marmaris fire. As part of the method, the NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), dNBR (Difference Normalized Burn Ratio), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and dNDVI (Difference Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) indices were used for burned area detection. As a result of the study, information about the burned areas, fire intensities, and the regenerative capabilities of post-fire vegetation growth has been obtained.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Furthermore, suitable pioneer plant species, considering the fire intensity, have been suggested for the restoration of burned landscape areas after the fire. This study is expected to serve as a guide for relevant public institutions and organizations, particularly the General Directorates of Forestry, enabling them to respond most effectively after fires and implement reforestation efforts considering the usage areas and growth capabilities of needle-leaved and broad-leaved plants.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Determination of fire intensity after forest fire by remote sensing: marmaris case study.

When the fire danger is \"Very High,\" fires can start easily from most causes and may spread rapidly with quick increase in intensity right after ignition. Small fires can quickly become large fires and exhibit extreme fire intensity, such as long-distance spotting.These fires can be difficult to control and can often become much larger and longer lasting.</p><p>Last week, six human-caused fires were reported on the Bridger-Teton National Forest. These fires, all from abandoned warming fires, have ranged in size from ' acre to 4.5 acres. Luckily, all these fires have been extinguished thanks to the vigilance of public reporting and firefighters patrolling the Forest. Fire managers are urging recreationists to use extreme caution with fire.</p><p>During the fall, frost kills summer grasses and vegetation, creating more light, cured fuels to carry fire. Larger fuels remain dry throughout the season, and winds become a major driver for fires. Additionally, with fall, comes the arrival of hunting season. People hunting and recreating on public lands will want to have warming fires and campfires with the cooler overnight temperatures. Public land users can help prevent wildfires by choosing to not have a fire at all and instead dress for success with multiple layers and warm clothing.</p><p>Unseasonably warm daytime temperatures and very dry conditions are predicted to continue over the weekend and into next week with periods of increased wind and no forecasted rain.</p><p>Fire managers advise recreationists to use extreme caution if choosing to build and maintain a campfire. In areas where campfires are allowed, fires should never be left unattended and must be completely extinguished before leaving. If choosing to have a campfire, keep it small and have a plan for putting it out before lighting it. All recreationists should have a shovel on hand and a water bucket ready for use. Soak, stir, feel, repeat. Make sure your campfire is \"dead out\" and cold to the touch before leaving. If it's too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave!</p><p>To date, 68 campfires have been abandoned or left unattended in the Teton Interagency Dispatch area.

Joe Neguse:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yesterday, U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse announced he secured $500,000 in Community Project Funding to Colorado State University (CSU) to advance their Multiuse UAS Airfield Project. This fundingsecured by Congressman Neguse as part of a government funding package signed into law earlier this yearwill support the renovation and improvement of Christman Airfield, which plays a key role in emergency firefighting operations across the Front Range and is paving the way in drone training and research for the Rocky Mountain West.</p><p>The Colorado Congressman was joined by CSU President Amy Parsons, Drone Center Director Christopher Robertson, and a wide array of university faculty and studentshighlighting the critical role of federal support in advancing this initiative. The event featured a ceremonial check presentation and allowed CSU researchers the opportunity to elaborate on the development of new aircraft and UAS technologies.</p><p>\"CSU stands at the forefront of innovation and technology in Colorado, and I'm incredibly proud to have secured $500,000 in Federal funding to help renovate and improve the Christman Airfield,\" said Assistant Leader Joe Neguse.\"After the recent Alexander Mountain and Stone Canyon Fires, our community understands the critical need to strengthen aerial firefighting and emergency management capabilitiesand this investment directly addresses that need. Together, we're taking meaningful steps to better protect Coloradans from the increasing threat of wildfires.\"</p><p>\"We're grateful to Congressman Neguse for his efforts to secure this funding for several community-based projects in Larimer County. Christman Airfield at CSU plays a critical role in wildfire mitigation, and is used for everything from response to natural disasters to law enforcement to search and rescue. It's also foundational to our drone education at CSU, and we're appreciative for the opportunity to invest in this multi-use resource,\" saidAmy Parsons, Colorado State University President .</p><p>\"Colorado State University's Christman Field is a highly versatile UAV research, education, and flight training facility, located northwest of Fort Collins at the base of the foothills. When it's not being utilized to train the next generation of aviators, the airfield also serves as an essential emergency operations center and staging ground for aerial firefighting efforts,\" said Adam Smith, Associate Director, Colorado State University Drone Center.\"As the third-longest continuously operating airfield in Colorado, the facilities and runway at Christman Field are beginning to show signs of age. This grant funding provides a crucial opportunity to revitalize the airfield, enabling expanded aerial firefighting operations. With these upgrades, Christman Field will remain a vital asset for Colorado's emergency management professionals, helping to safeguard our natural resources and mountain communities.\"</p><p>Additional Background on CSU Multiuse UAS Airfield Project:</p><p>As mentioned, the $500,000 federal investment will go toward the renovation and improvement of the Christman Airfield, which is utilized for aviation research and training for wildfire fighting. The renewed facility provides an updated location for aerial firefighting and emergency management during forest fire operations, supporting the protection of Colorado's natural areas as well as properties in the forested areas of the state.</p><p>Neguse secured a total of $11 million in Fiscal Year 2024 Community Project Funding for 14 projects that directly benefit cities and towns across Colorado's 2nd Congressional District.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126814686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DBP-3XB1-DYTH-G2R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 30, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, Tech4Nature has supported 11 flagship projects in eight countries with tailored solutions to conservation challenges.\"Tech4Nature is a global partnership between the nature conservation sector led by IUCN and the tech sector led by Huawei. It's a crucially important partnership because technology needs to be part of the solution to the biodiversity and climate crises facing the planet. Tech4Nature is about tapping into the innovation and energy of the tech sector to help solve these issues,\" said James Hardcastle, Global Protected and Conserved Areas Director for IUCN. Phase II of Tech4Nature kicked off in 2024 with new projects launched or scheduled in five countries, including a biodiversity monitoring and protection project in Spain's Sierra Nevada, which was launched last week.The Greek startup PROBOTEK introduced the new forest fire prevention and response system developed under the TECH4ALL initiative. Working with the Greece government, project partners PROBOTEK, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and Huawei selected Skiathos in October 2024 as a pilot site for Phase II of the solution. Comprising sensors, 5G, AI, and drones, the solution is expected to mitigate the potential devastation caused by forest fires by enabling an emergency response within the first 'golden 15 minutes' of detection, sending evacuation routes to residents' phones, and planning routes for fire trucks and ambulances.In the area of education, UNESCO has partnered with Huawei TECH4ALL on theOpen Schoolinitiative and UNESCO Campus. At the TECH4ALL Forum, UNESCO presented its strategies for boosting education equity and quality on a global scale.\"UNESCO's STEM strategy aims to amplify the efforts of the UNESCO Member States in promoting STEM education by building a robust ecosystem that supports the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and innovation. It emphasizes a number of actions, including increasing youth engagement in STEM fields, improving teacher capacities, and promoting gender equality and inclusion,\" said Magdalena Landry, Director of the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Science and Culture in Europe.TECH4ALL partners Close the Gap and Konexio explored how the DigiTruck projects are driving digital inclusion through digital skills training for priority communities in France, including the elderly and unemployed youth. To date, the project has reached 6,000 people across 31 cities. At the DigiTALL event held in the evening, the two partners received an award for their contribution to digital inclusion and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Under its TECH4ALL initiative, Huawei has worked with a range of partners, including governments, NGOs, IGOs, carriers, environmental organizations, universities, and technology companies. Given the pivotal role that technology plays in driving both inclusion and sustainability, Huawei expects to develop more projects and partnerships in Europe in the future.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About TECH4ALL</emphasis>TECH4ALL is Huawei's long-term digital inclusion initiative and action plan.

This funding--secured by Congressman Neguse as part of a government funding package signed into law earlier this year--will support the renovation and improvement of Christman Airfield, which plays a key role in emergency firefighting operations across the Front Range and is paving the way in drone training and research for the Rocky Mountain West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Colorado Congressman was joined by CSU President Amy Parsons, Drone Center Director Christopher Robertson, and a wide array of university faculty and students--highlighting the critical role of federal support in advancing this initiative. The event featured a ceremonial check presentation and allowed CSU researchers the opportunity to elaborate on the development of new aircraft and UAS technologies.</p><p>\"CSU stands at the forefront of innovation and technology in Colorado, and I'm incredibly proud to have secured $500,000 in Federal funding to help renovate and improve the Christman Airfield,\" said Assistant Leader Joe Neguse. \"After the recent Alexander Mountain and Stone Canyon Fires, our community understands the critical need to strengthen aerial firefighting and emergency management capabilities--and this investment directly addresses that need. Together, we're taking meaningful steps to better protect Coloradans from the increasing threat of wildfires.\"</p><p>\"We're grateful to Congressman Neguse for his efforts to secure this funding for several community-based projects in Larimer County. Christman Airfield at CSU plays a critical role in wildfire mitigation, and is used for everything from response to natural disasters to law enforcement to search and rescue. It's also foundational to our drone education at CSU, and we're appreciative for the opportunity to invest in this multi-use resource,\" said Amy Parsons, Colorado State University President .</p><p>\"Colorado State University's Christman Field is a highly versatile UAV research, education, and flight training facility, located northwest of Fort Collins at the base of the foothills. When it's not being utilized to train the next generation of aviators, the airfield also serves as an essential emergency operations center and staging ground for aerial firefighting efforts,\" said Adam Smith, Associate Director, Colorado State University Drone Center. \"As the third-longest continuously operating airfield in Colorado, the facilities and runway at Christman Field are beginning to show signs of age.

As stated on his website, \"As a rice farmer, I understand the unique challenges and obstacles facing our agricultural industry, from excessive state and federal regulations, unpredictable and sometimes catastrophic weather conditions, volatile markets, and significant barriers preventing new and young farmers from gaining stability.\"</p><p>Agriculture and forestry are the main priorities of LaMalfa. He authored and passed California's Forest Fire Protection Act of 2004, allowing landowners to make their rural lands fire-safe.</p><p>He previously worked as a member of the House Agriculture Committee in which he advocated for eliminating costly direct payments, streamlining federal programs, investing in specialty crops and ensuring farmers have resources to deal with droughts and wildfires, as stated on his website.\u00a0</p><p>Other central issues to LaMalfa are the economy and job creation. He stated on his website he believes in order to build a strong economic recovery that will provide more jobs for Americans, congress needs to \"get the fiscal house in order.\" He also believes Congress needs a comprehensive review of federal regulations.\u00a0</p><p>LaMalfa opposes certain tax increases and defends California's Proposition 13, which reformed property tax laws.\u00a0</p><p>As stated on his website, \"Doug believes that taxpayers know better than bureaucrats and politicians how to spend and invest their own hard-earned money.\"</p><p>Education is another central issue to LaMalfa. As stated on his website, he believes the federal government has repeatedly failed to improve educational outcomes for students.\u00a0</p><p>He believes parents should have control over their children's education, and should have the opportunity to send their children to charter or private schools, or homeschool them. He is also concerned about rising tuition for college students.</p><p>Regarding the issue of healthcare, LaMalfa believes all Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care, as he stated on his website. He stated he supports repealing and replacing Obamacare. \u00a0</p><p>LaMalfa also supports protecting water rights and developing more water storage. He has advocated for increasing California's water supply and supports projects such as Sites Reservoir and the Auburn Dam.\u00a0</p><p>As stated on LaMalfa's website, he believes, \"Government should do no harm and that limited government means government should do only what people cannot do for themselves, in the most efficient manner possible.\"</p><p>The election for California's 1st Congressional district between LaMalfa and Yee will be on Nov. 5.\u00a0</p><p>Bea Williams can be reached at [email protected].</p><p>View Story Comments</p><p>0</p><p>Like This Story</p><p>Share on Facebook</p><p>Share on X</p><p>Email this Story</p><p>Print this Story</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5963871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D81-KXN1-JBSN-3550-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Orion: California State University - Chico</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 23, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Chico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

According to news reporting from VNU University of Science by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The main objective of this study was to produce forest fire susceptibility maps in the Nghe An province of Vietnam using machine learning models and GIS, namely Deep Neural Network (DNN), Hunger Games Search (HGS), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Adaboost (ADB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from VNU University of Science: \"The application of these models included 1042 current and former forest fire points and 14 conditioning factors. The dataset was divided with a ratio of 70/30, with 70% for building the model and the remaining 30% for testing it.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Each model was evaluated by various statistical indices and the results show that HGS performed best in constructing susceptibility maps and improving the performance of the DNN model compared to the reference models, with the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) of 0.967 The findings of this research may support decision-makers on sustainable land-use planning.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Hybrid models based on deep learning neural network and optimization algorithms for the spatial prediction of tropical forest fire susceptibility in Nghe An province, Vietnam.

According to news reporting from Lisbon, Portugal, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"BRIDGE (bridging science and local communities for wildfire risk reduction) is an action-research project developing a community-based disaster risk reduction (CBDRR) process which is being fostered through a collaborative innovation laboratory (InnoLab).\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Portuguese Foundation For Science And Technology, I.P; The Framework of The Project Bridge; The Research Unit Citua. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Lisbon: \"BRIDGE integrates different forms of knowledge and action, linking science and local communities to reduce their vulnerability and to enhance strategies for forest fire risk reduction. Applied in Monchique, a forest-fire-prone municipality in Portugal, the InnoLab creates a space for dialogue and knowledge sharing between multiple actors that, directly or indirectly, manage forest territories. BRIDGE attempts to facilitate social learning about forest fire risks, strengthen collaborative networks and enhance adaptive capacities (socially and institutionally) for forest fire prevention. This paper shares results of the InnoLab activities, which include (i) school community activities on wildfire risk perception; (ii) participatory mapping of Monchique's vulnerabilities and risks; (iii) participatory sessions to create the community visioning for Monchique's territory, to define priorities and capacities to be improved, and to identify functions and responsibilities to act upon; and (iv) workshop on CBDRR strategies for action.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Lessons are shared on how InnoLab can represent an innovative participatory approach to promote CBDRR processes in forest-fire-prone territories by both contributing to the recognition of local knowledge systems and encouraging the active role of forest communities through strengthened local networks for a more lasting commitment to forest fire risk reduction policy.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Monchique's Innovation Laboratory-A Space for Dialogue and Knowledge Sharing to Foster Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction.

And some \u201cwill have experienced significant damage from smoke and toxic ash deposits,\u201d noted Daniel Swain, a University of California, Los Angeles, climate scientist, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUpZzHUxYJo\">at a webinar</url> earlier this week. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThis is a growing concern in the wake of this highly urban fire that burned not just vegetation, but a whole lot of structures that contain things like lead paint, asbestos, various heavy metals contained in the batteries that burned in vehicles and in home system backups and solar panels,\u201d he said.</p><p>Describing these losses as \u201ca staggering toll,\u201d Swain warned of indirect harm residents could endure from smoke and toxic ash exposures.</p><p>\u201cThe health harms, the illness and sometimes, the death that can result from large scale disasters and wildfires, is not limited only to the people who don\u2019t make it out of the fire zone,\u201d he added.</p><p>Heading into a likely rainy weekend, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/palisades-fire\">Palisades Fire</url>, which has ravaged the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was 23,448 acres and 77 percent contained. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire\">The Eaton Fire</url>, north of Pasadena, was 14,021 acres with 95 percent containment. But the new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/22/hughes-fire\">Hughes Fire</url>, which began Wednesday near Castaic Lake, had grown to 10,396 acres and was only 56 percent contained. </p><p>Wildfire smoke contains a mixture of pollutants, although the most well-studied ingredient is fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). When inhaled, these tiny particles can invade the lungs and penetrate the bloodstream, noted Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at the University of San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, <url normalizedValue=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/california-wildfire-analysis-scripps-oceanography-climate-experts\">in a recent explainer</url>.</p><p>In addition to exacerbating existing conditions like asthma, repeat PM 2.5 exposure is also associated with future lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and dementia, Benmarhnia stated. He and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124\">colleagues recently demonstrated</url> how repeat exposures to PM 2.5 from wildfire smoke over multiple years can increase the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p><p>Shedding light on the wildfire smoke\u2019s reach, Scripps Oceanography researchers announced Tuesday they identified ash and debris as far away as 100 miles offshore \u2014 prompting concern about potential impacts on fisheries and the broader food web.</p><p>\u201cThese fires are not only consuming vegetation but also massive amounts of urban infrastructure,\u201d project leader Julie Dinasquet <url normalizedValue=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/marine-ecosystem-survey-encounters-new-variable-falling-ash-los-angeles-fires\">said in a statement</url>. \u201cThis introduces a novel \u2018urban ash\u2019 component to the wildfire source, filled with exceptionally toxic materials.\u201d</p><p>Among the materials she flagged were lead, arsenic, asbestos, microplastics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organic compounds that occur naturally in fossil fuels.</p><p>\u201cThese fires pose a potential significant threat to both humans and ecosystems through the introduction of a large amount of toxic material in the system,\u201d Dinasquet added.</p><h>Public health hazards riddled with uncertainty</h><p>Precisely just how big the public health threat of these wildfires will be, whom that threat will affect and when, remains uncertain.</p><p>Richard Castriotta, a pulmonologist at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, noted the \u201cbig difference\u201d between urban wildfires such as those burning in Los Angeles and those that impact trees alone.</p><p>Recognizing the dangers associated with forest fire smoke are real, Castriotta told The Hill they pale in comparison to the potential contaminants unleashed by a burning building.</p><p>He, too, described a smorgasbord of toxic substances involved in such exposures, including chlorine, lead, asbestos and oxides of nitrogen, as well as mystery materials \u2014 created as a high-intensity flame \u201cturns the plastics and artificial materials into unknown substances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe danger is there for everybody, but it\u2019s worse, naturally, for people who have lung disease, heart disease, diabetes and impaired immunity,\u201d Castriotta said, also noting pregnant and nursing individuals could be at risk.</p><p>Children, meanwhile, are particularly vulnerable and should not be involved in cleaning up houses burned in the blazes, he stressed.</p><p>Short-term effects of exposure to smoke tend to appear in both the upper and lower airways, with the nose screening out a lot of larger particles and then the lungs acting as \u201ca first responder\u201d to some of the smaller particles, Castriotta explained.</p><p>\u201cThis is our first immune response, and so if there are a lot of these toxic particles that get in, it can overwhelm the immune response system,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would render the person, regardless of previous state of health, relatively immune deficient \u2014 unable to cope with additional burdens, much like the firefighters themselves.\u201d</p><p>In the days and weeks to come, that immune impairment could lead to a greater chance of contracting respiratory ailments like pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19 and bronchitis, Castriotta added. As for people who are already ill, he said that the exposure could exacerbate conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis and heart disease.</p><p>Castriotta acknowledged, however, he doesn\u2019t know what the long-term effects of exposure to these fires will be and that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure if anybody does.\u201d Referencing the 9/11 twin towers collapse, he noted how long it took to determine health impacts on first responders. And while he recognized the differences between these situations, he described similar uncertainties.</p><p>One potential problem in many of the homes that burned could be the presence of asbestos, which Castriotta described as \u201ca durable, fireproof fiber that lasts forever.\u201d If these fibers get into the lungs, the \u201cfirst-responder\u201d white blood cells \u201cdon\u2019t have the ability to digest and destroy them,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why there is a long latent period from the exposure to asbestos and the adverse consequences that may be as long as 30 years,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the same time, Castriotta noted that long-term impact depends on both the duration and extent of exposure \u2014 and that inhaling one single particle of asbestos wouldn\u2019t lead to disease.</p><h>Things could have been worse</h><p>Although the air pollution levels in these dense, urban conditions might be dire, circumstances could have been even worse if the fires had occurred in the summer instead of the winter.</p><p>Alexei Khalizov, a professor of chemistry and environmental science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, attributed this difference to the higher levels of ground ozone that are notorious on Los Angeles summer days.</p><p>Wildfires, he explained, produce high concentrations of chemicals that exhibit a range of volatilities, with low-volatile compounds condensing on soot particles quickly as smoke cools.</p><p>The more volatile chemicals are not able to condense as rapidly and instead travel in the air alongside the soot and interact with other pollutants, such as ozone, according to Khalizov. Only then do they become less volatile and begin to condense onto the soot \u2014 thereby increasing the toxicity of these particles, he noted.</p><p>Among the volatile compounds that alarmed Khalizov the most was polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a common ingredient in plastics. He referred to the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, after which officials made the controversial decision to burn tankers of vinyl chloride \u2014 a cancer-causing chemical used to produce PVC \u2014 to prevent an explosion.</p><p>\u201cPolyvinyl chloride is not very different from the chemical which is used to make it,\u201d he said.</p><p>In an urban wildfire scenario, Khalizov raised concerns about the compounding effects of multiple contaminants, or what he described as a \u201csynergism between pollutants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re exposed to smoke and ozone together, they actually make a much worse effect,\u201d he said.</p><h>Risks in returning home</h><p>As residents begin returning to their charred homes and cleaning up the remains, Castriotta recommended they do so only with N95 masks and goggles, while also warning that air quality indexes don\u2019t account for the toxic materials he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cPeople will look at the Air Quality Index and say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s moderate, or it\u2019s good, it\u2019s the usual L.A. air,'\u201d Castriotta said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t measure the specific toxins that are released from these particular fires.\u201d</p><p>Swain, from UCLA, likewise urged residents to wear particulate filtering masks and use HEPA filters indoors, citing county-wide health advisories of wind-borne ash that could be \u201cfalling from the sky.\u201d</p><p>Taking such steps, he reiterated, could help minimize future repercussions impacts of such disasters, particularly since smoke and ash can persist even after a fire is largely extinguished.</p><p>\u201cThe health harms, the casualties and injuries in the days and weeks and months and even years that follow are indirect and they\u2019re harder to count,\u201d Swain added. \u201cThese sorts of large-scale disasters have a much greater toll than we\u2019ve really been able to quantify easily in decades past.\u201d</p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com\">For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THHLCM-httpsthehillcompolicyenergyenvironment5105358losangeleswildfirestoxicairpollutantsconcerns</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THHLCM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F07-6TP3-RWK8-P2GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487142</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 NEXSTAR MEDIA INC.

This includes, federal, state, local and tribal firefighters.</p><p>In the last 24 hours there have been 50 starts that firefighters have stopped, according to Moore.</p><p>The cause of each of the fires is still unknown but are being investigated, containing the fires is the current priority.</p><p>Moore emphasized that the most concerning factor is the wind, which not only helps the fires spread but also makes the firefight more difficult. The wind makes it difficult to fly aircraft that aid in the firefight, and it causes retardant and water being dropped to be blown away before making an impact.</p><p>FEMA regional administrator Bob Fenton shared that one thing the organization is working on is bringing in mental health specialists to help those affected by the fires.</p><p>Harris and Fenton both addressed issues of gaps in insurance and insurance policies being canceled.

According to news originating from Nanning, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Open biomass burning has significant adverse effects on regional air quality, climate change, and human health. Extensive open biomass burning is detected in most regions of China, and capturing the characteristics of open biomass burning and understanding its influencing factors are important prerequisites for regulating open biomass burning.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Guangxi Science And Technology Major Program; Fundamental Research Fund of Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Science And Technology Development Fund of Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences: \"The characteristics of open biomass burning have been widely investigated at the national scale, with regional studies often focusing on northeast China, but few studies have examined regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations over a long timescale in Guangxi province. In this study, we used the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fire product (VNP14IMG), combined with land cover data and high-resolution remote sensing images, to extract open biomass burning (crop residue burning and forest fire) fire points in Guangxi province from 2012 to 2023. We explored the spatial density distribution and temporal variation of open biomass burning using spatial analysis methods and statistical methods, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed the driving forces of open biomass burning in Guangxi province from natural (topography, climate, and plant schedule), policy, and social (crop production and cultural customs) perspectives. The results show that open biomass burning is concentrated in the central, eastern, and southern parts of the study area, where there are frequent agricultural activities and abundant forests. At the city level, the highest numbers of fire points were found in Baise, Yulin, Wuzhou, and Nanning. The open biomass burning fire points exhibited large annual variation, with high levels from 2013 to 2015 and a remarkable decrease from 2016 to 2020 under strict control measures; however, inconsistent enforcement led to a significant rebound in fire points from 2021 to 2023. Forest fires are the predominant type of open biomass burning in the region, with forest fires and crop residue burning accounting for 76.82% and 23.18% of the total, respectively.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The peak period for crop residue burning occurs in the winter, influenced mainly by topography, planting schedules, crop production, and policies, while forest fires predominantly occur in the winter and spring, primarily influenced by topography, climate, and cultural customs. The results indicate that identifying the driving forces behind spatiotemporal variations is essential for the effective management of open biomass burning.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatiotemporal Analysis of Open Biomass Burning in Guangxi Province, China, from 2012 to 2023 Based on VIIRS.

According to news reporting out of Agadir, Morocco, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Critical event reporting Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) applications need vital requirements (extended network lifetime, reliability, real time responsiveness, and scalability) to be met to ensure outstanding efficiency. Previous frameworks only consider few individual requirements, thus ignoring the other equally important ones.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Faculty of Sciences, \"Ensuring that an active path is available at all times is crucial for enabling the timely transmission of critical data and maintaining the quality of service required to efficiently support delay-sensitive applications. This paper proposes an application-specific Routing Protocol based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Software Defined Network (SDN)-enabled WSN forest fire detection (RPLS). First, we designed a clustering algorithm that delays re-clustering to save energy by keeping the same topology for several rounds. Unlike existing works, this algorithm decreases the cluster radius based not only on the energy parameters but also on the quality of the links. After the network clustering, the power of the SDN controller is used to intelligently define using RL the optimal paths for the sensor nodes and accordingly reduce the load on these constrained nodes. For routing strategy, we formulate an RL-based reward function considering not only the energy efficiency parameters but also the anticipated and post-failure reliability parameters to ensure real time responsiveness and optimize energy consumption. Finally, we conducted comparisons by means of simulations in forest fires detection scenario.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Compared to RL-SDWSN, the results show an improvement of 14.064 % in network operational lifetime and 16.41 % in response time. .\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A Reinforcement Learning Based Routing Protocol for Software-defined Networking Enabled Wireless Sensor Network Forest Fire Detection.

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires result in severe disaster, causing significant ecological damage and substantial economic losses. Flames and smoke represent the predominant characteristics of forest fires.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST): \"However, these flames and smoke often exhibit irregular shapes, rendering them susceptible to erroneous positive or negative identifications, consequently compromising the overall performance of detection systems. To enhance the average precision and recall rates of detection, this paper introduces an enhanced iteration of the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) algorithm. This advanced algorithm aims to achieve more effective fire detection. First, we use Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC) in the backbone network of the traditional YOLOv5 to enhance the capture of a larger receptive field. Then, we introduce Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) to improve the modeling of long-range dependencies. Finally, we incorporate Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) to address issues related to missed detections and repeated detections of flames and smoke by the algorithm. Among the plethora of models explored, our proposed algorithm achieves a 2.0% improvement in mean Average Precision@0.5 (mAP<sup>50</sup>) and a 3.1% enhancement in Recall when compared with the YOLOv5 algorithm.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The integration of SAC, PSA, and Soft-NMS significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of the detection algorithm. Moreover, the comprehensive algorithm proposed here can identify and detect key changes in various monitoring scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Efficient Forest Fire Detection Algorithm Using Improved YOLOv5.

According to news reporting originating from Arar, Saudi Arabia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This paper aims to contribute to the field of green environment and meteorological signal processing by exploring methods for analyzing and predicting environmental factors. The focus is on developing an intelligent approach for preventing and predicting wildfires that may arise due to changes in atmospheric temperature or other conditions.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Deanship of Scientific Research at Northern Border University, Arar, KSA. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Northern Border University, \"The proposed solution involves using machine learning and evolutionary deep learning to create a neural model that can interact with the Internet of Things (IoT) and respond in real-time to minimize potential damage. The experiments were carried out in the forests of Jandouba, Tunisia, using Python software.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results demonstrate that this approach offers significant advantages over the most ranked existing Canadian method (FWI) for fire weather index.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Artificial Intelligence Optimization for Forest Fire Risk Predicting Applied To Green Environment.

Acrid. Unidentifiable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ash is everywhere and comes in many sizes, from black and gray slivers collecting along curbs to a suspended white dust that settles on smartphone screens. Craving a sense of recovery instead of daily updates on the containment of the fires plaguing the city, neighbors compare air quality apps, debate the advantages of N95 versus KN95 masks and the best filters for any available air purifier they can find.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of thousands of apartments and single-family homes in this Mediterranean climate have no AC or central filtration system. Windows are taped up. A county of 9.6 million people, whether they lost homes to the fires or not, suddenly have one thing in common: the poisoned cloud blanketing them, raining down particulate matter that public health officials warn is toxic and carcinogenic.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Assume the worst,\" said Sarah Rees, a director at the South Coast Air Quality Management District. \"When you see that ash, take the precautions needed to protect yourself and protect your health.\"\u00a0</p><p>Wildfire researchers across the country watching the SoCal disaster are equally alarmed.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's just terrible on all fronts, in terms of the health impacts,\" said Chris Lim, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humlab.co\">an air quality researcher</url> at the University of Arizona. \"A long-term concern is that a lot of these toxic gases or VOCs [volatile organic compounds] will get into homes and linger for months.\"\u00a0</p><p>The chemical composition of the smoke and ash in Los Angeles right now is different from forest fire smoke, which is plenty toxic on its own, said Lim. The more than 40,000 acres that have burned since last week in LA included more than 12,000 structures and everything around them, from cars to infrastructure. The firestorms that began 10 days ago are releasing chemicals from electronics, laminated floors, treated wood, paint, metals, cleaning products stored under sinks and an incalculable volume of plastics. <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27082020/california-fire-smoke-health-effects/\">Fallout from urban fires</url> typically includes heavy metals like lead and mercury along with PCBs and noxious gases, all of which are now hovering over or landing around homes of Angelenos.\u00a0</p><p>Significant exposure to urban wildfire pollution carries both acute and chronic impacts for human bodies, said <url normalizedValue=\"https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/rima-habre/\">Rima Habre</url>, an environmental health scholar at the University of Southern California who lives in Los Angeles. During and immediately after wildfires and urban conflagrations, those with compromised respiratory systems, cardiovascular issues or any condition related to inflammation are likely to feel the impact. Incidences of heart attacks and strokes go up right after firestorms. Habre says <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateandhealth.nih.gov/\">more research is needed</url> on potential long-term effects, but what's been proven so far is harrowing. The \"chronic\" impacts include lower birth weights, enduring lung conditions in children, a variety of cancers in adults and increased cases of dementia.\u00a0</p><p>\"The biggest impacts are the mental health ones, long term,\" says Habre, referring to everyone experiencing the regional crisis and its toxic-air aftereffects, not only those who lost homes. Anxiety. Depression. Trauma responses with their crippling triggers. And bigger picture, she notes that people are collectively processing the recent barrage of worst-case scenarios come to life: \"With climate change, there's an expectation that these things could happen more often.\"\u00a0</p><p>As the portion of the fires that have been contained inches up day by day, health officials and scientists are warning the outdoor-loving citizens of Los Angeles to not get complacent about toxic exposure once the flames finally die out.</p><p>\"There are going to be a lot of dangers related to cleanup,\" says LA County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis, who's already banned the use of leaf-blowers to avoid stirring toxic, fallen ash back into the air. \"It's hard to have everyone get the message.\"\u00a0</p><p>But there's some hope in that message, or at least a greater sense of agency, with officials and researchers offering <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/home/air-quality/wildfire-health-info-smoke-tips\">practical advice</url> about how to reduce exposure now. Their recommendations, which are valuable to any community in the country confronted by smoke waves from wildfires and urban firestorms, include:\u00a0</p><p>Monitoring air quality is an imperfect science, stressed Rees from <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/\">South Coast AQMD</url>. While it's helpful to check the Air Quality Index (AQI) levels on apps, large-particle pollution (like ash) and gaseous VOCs are not included in the index. She suggests signing up for regional air advisories (like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aqmd.gov/home/air-quality/air-alerts\">this one</url> for the southern coast of California) that cover more variables.\u00a0</p><p>County and regional officials are not offering specific timelines for how long the high-alert air quality conditions might last, but more than one have used the phrase \"long haul.\" On Wednesday, the LA Country Public Health Officer <url normalizedValue=\"http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;ou=ph&amp;prog=media&amp;cur=cur&amp;prid=4943&amp;row=25&amp;start=1\">prohibited the removal of debris from burn sites</url> \"until a hazardous materials inspection is completed by an approved government agency.\" Municipalities like Santa Monica, which sits just south of the Palisades fire zone, have posted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DExt3VKSMu9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">social media reminders</url> about air quality warnings and best-practices for self-protection on a daily basis this week. Wednesday, the City of Pasadena declared a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cityofpasadena.net/city-manager/news/pasadena-public-health-declares-local-health-emergency-due-to-impacts-of-eaton-fire/\">local public health emergency</url> \"due to the widespread impacts of Eaton Fire, including the presence of ash and particulate matter in the air throughout the community.\"</p><p>As hard as it is to accept that the dangers will linger and even expand, Habre noted that most of the United States has been experiencing diminished air quality in the past few years as a result of wildfires in the Western U.S. and Canada. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/7/6/184\">preliminary </url>case study published by American researchers last year suggested that wildfire air pollution can land and even stay trapped in urban \"basins\" (based on topography and weather patterns) far away from the fires. So the air quality threat from LA right now is not only a matter of duration but also expansion. Lim said he expected the impacts to be, to some degree, \"transcontinental.\"\u00a0</p><p>Pulling off any of those preventative protocols from a wheelchair that has ash caught up in its tires, however, presents another level of challenge.\u00a0</p><p>Rudy Contreras runs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scrs-ilc.org/\">Southern California Resource Services for Independent Living</url>, a nonprofit founded and managed by people with disabilities. The office headquarters are on Altadena Drive, right below the 210 in Pasadena, near where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire\">Eaton Fire</url> broke out last week.\u00a0</p><p>\"The fire wasn't there but the smoke was,\" says Contreras. \"Our offices got shut down because power went out and the smoke drowned our HVAC system.\"</p><p>Knowing many clients would be in crisis immediately, Contreras rushed to set up operations from his home.\u00a0</p><p>\"We had several individuals contacting us saying their apartments were filled with smoke,\" he said. \"The level of smoke that blew into these units! It's stuck on the furniture now like sludge, infused into these households, and that's what you're breathing in.\"</p><p>One family told Contreras they were already too ill to stay, so he began searching for options to evacuate them quickly. He offered to get a hotel room that night, but the family didn't have access to transportation. Contreras, who also has a disability, spent hours piecing together a solution: He discovered that Airbnb had launched an emergency <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.airbnb.com/e/lawildfires?c=.pi0.pk22115202631_174897868044&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;c=.pi0.pk22115202631_174897868044&amp;ghost=true&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADz55LmiimbhjpYtPoaUwT6NJyfYm&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1p28BhCBARIsADP9HrO3Yz2d9TFr-klONr9RUXMYkLnw5dUyKZFDdSQ_aGGuCwbhFxRLIuwaAvxxEALw_wcB\">temporary housing program</url> for evacuees, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://ktla.com/news/local-news/uber-lyft-offer-free-rides-to-southern-california-residents-affected-by-wildfires/\">Uber and Lyft were offering discounted rides</url>. The family was able to evacuate to a one-week Airbnb in Alhambra, 20 minutes away.\u00a0</p><p>But that was just one crisis call. There have been many more, mostly about air quality.</p><p>\"I'm telling people, 'You need to go to your healthcare physician immediately. We don't know what you inhaled,'\" says Contreras.\u00a0</p><p>Now that power has been restored on Altadena Drive, he's hoping to re-open the office this week. One thing he has for clients now is N95 masks-he's kept them in stock by the thousands ever since COVID. But house cleaning, air purifiers, safe transportation and accessible long-term evacuation options to limit smoke and ash exposure are all daunting.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"It's been barrier after barrier, and there's some depression. People are sad. They're asking, 'What's next? How do we do this?'\" said Contreras. \"I don't have all those answers.\"\u00a0</p><p>Audrey Gray is a Los Angeles-based climate journalist focused on adaptation and sustainable design.

One of those fires, the Sand Stone Fire, damaged areas in Central Arizona just northeast of Phoenix. While, thankfully, the fire did not damage any homes or claim any lives, it did burn portions of the Sycamore Creek site of the NSF National Ecological Observatory Network (NSF NEON). As the damage is remedied, researchers could use the impact and data NSF NEON collects to learn more about how fire interacts with the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ecology of fire in the Sonoran Desert</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sycamore Creek is an aquatic NEON site in the Tonto National Forest, managed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). The area, broadly part of the Sonoran Desert, is populated by a mix of native and invasive plant species, with many of the latter brought in by humans. Introduced grasses can help feed fire, further impacting native species including the well-known Saguaro cactus many of which are not adapted to survive frequent intense fires.</p><p>Credit: USDA Forest Service photo by Amanda Oliver</p><p>Tonto National Forest Fire Ecologist Mary Lata explains her data collection and documentation process to assess prescribed fire treatments on the landscape with meteorologist Ian Schwartz during a prescribed fire operation Nov. 7, 2023. \"Although most of the shrubs that are in the desert are adapted to fire and will sprout back pretty vigorously in the first couple of years and be okay in the long run, with more frequent and intense fires, they can't,\" said Mary Lata, a fire ecologist with USFS Tonto Forest. \"In the areas you see along highways or in intense recreation areas like at the NSF NEON Sycamore site, the shrubs eventually just kind of give up. And it becomes a grassland.\"</p><p>As fires become more frequent, they are also becoming larger, according to Lata.</p><p>\"Fires are getting bigger because of the contiguous fuel load from grasses, and it's mostly introduced grasses, red brome. But they've been here for so long, we can't get rid of them, and so that IS the system now,\" she said.</p><p>Studying disturbance in Sycamore Creek</p><p>The area in and around Sycamore Creek has been used to study the impact of environmental disturbances for some time. The work has been funded by NSF investments as well as those of other federal agencies.</p><p>In addition to fire, the area faces disturbance from flooding that results from heavy rains during monsoon season, leading to impacts on both the biology and geology of the area. During the dry season, the potential for wildfire is high, and the ecosystem can take decades to recover from large fires. Additionally, the changing landscape and introduction of invasive plant species provide a unique vehicle to study the impacts of ecological change.</p><p>Since 1997, the Central Arizona-Phoenix site of the NSF Long Term Ecological Research site, managed by Arizona State University, has engaged in research on the human-environment interactions mediated by urban ecological infrastructure in the Phoenix metro area and the surrounding parts of the Sonoran Desert. USFS conducts research and management activities that support native flora and fauna (especially rare or endangered species), invasive species removal and monitoring, riparian resources protection, mining and grazing permitting, and wilderness areas management.</p><p>NEON, through instrumentation, field collections and airborne observations, collects an array of data at Sycamore Creek. This includes information on vegetation composition and the amount of area covered with plants, ecosystem structure, relative humidity, wind, temperature, precipitation, streamflow, aquatic organisms and more. The observatory collects these data at each of its other 81 sites across the country and provides them all openly and free. These standardized data from across ecosystems enable novel research on the impacts of ecological disturbance.</p><p>\"NEON is discovering processes operating at continental scales that determine ecosystem responses to droughts, floods, hurricanes, wildfire and other large-scale disturbance events,\" said Andrew Elmore, program director in the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences, who works on the NEON program. \"These disturbances can cause direct or downstream effects on natural resources on which society is dependent and that are costly to remedy, so it is critical that we monitor these things.\"</p><p>Facts about the Sand Stone Fire</p><p>Start date: July 25, 2024.</p><p>Cause: Started by lightning strike.</p><p>Originating Location: 14 miles northeast of Fountain Hills, Arizona.</p><p>Largest Size: 27,390 acres.</p><p>Impact on NEON and possibilities for research moving forward</p><p>The Sand Stone Fire damaged communication and power equipment at Sycamore Creek, but the automatic sensors that collect the data were unaffected. While the sensors continued to collect data, due to the damaged equipment, the facility could not stream data and make it accessible to the community in real time.</p><p>A charred Saguaro cactus at the NSF NEON Sycamore Creek site after the Sand Stone Fire</p><p>Credit: NSF NEON operated by Battelle</p><p>Representatives from Battelle, who operates NSF NEON, took video footage of the charred Saguaro cacti at the NSF NEON Sycamore Creek site after the Sand Stone Fire. The fire damaged areas in Central Arizona just northeast of Phoenix, including the Sycamore Creek site. As the damage is remedied, researchers could use the impact and data NSF NEON collects to learn more about how fire interacts with the environment.</p><p>Outside of the equipment, the ground and vegetation around the site were badly burnt. Where iconic Saguaro cacti once stood tall, most in the area are now just limp, charred skeletons on blackened ground.</p><p>\"Just looking at a picture or video, you can see the difference between the site pre-fire and after,\" said Paula Mabee, NEON chief scientist and observatory director. \"That visible difference likely doesn't even begin to show the long-term effects on the ecology of the area. Due to the harsh desert conditions and fragile soil, recovery after a major fire is slow and can take decades.\"</p><p>As with previous impacts on the observatory, the data collected hold the potential to explain fire and fuel dynamics, impacts on natural resources and biodiversity, and more. NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) surveys of the areas provided a foundational baseline to measure the change.</p><p>Prior to the Sand Stone Fire, NEON staff had documented nine wildfires, two floods and two hurricanes impacting sites from the Pacific Northwest to Appalachia, Alaska to Puerto Rico. In these cases, the data NEON collected were used by the community to understand spatial burn severity patterns, fuel characteristics, and pre-fire forest structure.</p><p>Credit: NSF NEON operated by Battelle</p><p>A map of the United States shows where sites throughout the NSF National Ecological Observatory Network (NSF NEON) has been impacted by natural disasters.</p><p>The impact on Sycamore Creek presents similar opportunities for understanding pre-, during and post-fire characteristics of the environment and working to apply them to broader contexts with an eventual goal of mitigating the impact of wildfires on communities and infrastructure.</p><p>For example, research using the NEON AOP and satellite data could be used to track carbon release from areas impacted by the fire and compare them to areas that have not been burnt. Similarly, soil sensors and measurements taken by field staff can denote how the area's flora and the various forms of life it supports recovers after the fire.</p><p>\"There is immense scientific potential provided by using the sensors, LiDAR, and field data, but there is also immense educational opportunity,\" Mabee said. \"Training the next generation of scientists to use this type and amount of data to predict disturbance and mitigate its impact is a key component of NEON.\"</p><p>Get to know NSF NEON</p><p>The National Ecological Observatory Network (NSF NEON) is the only observation facility in the U.S. that provides open and free continental-scale biological and environmental data.</p><p>Research enabled by NSF NEON is increasing our understanding of continental-scale biology, including ecosystem responses to hazards and disturbance events like droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes.</p><p>NEON collects over 180 different data types at 81 field sites across the country and makes all data freely open and accessible.</p><p>NEON hosts public Science Seminars on many topics, including using NEON to enable remote sensing in forests, coding tutorials to aid in understanding and making use of LiDAR data, and other avenues for learning about ecology, wildland fire, and environmental data science. The upcoming Feb. 11 seminar will cover insight into satellite-based fire tracking and ecosystem impacts.</p><p>The data from the Sycamore Creek site could be used to understand fire in this broader scientific and educational context, but it will also have use in understanding the ecology of the Sonoran Desert and the Southwestern U.S., a key focal area given recent environmental and societal changes in the area.</p><p>\"I just want to see a lot more people digging into this geographic area to really get more understanding of what these changes mean for the future of the desert,\" said Lata.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126966810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3N-R5H3-RXKF-21V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 24, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We have seen truly remarkable efforts from our fire service. Let's support them by using caution and common sense out there.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Associated Press <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/massachusetts-brush-fires-28a767116a97ee06624d2dc74606a8fb\"> reported on Sunday</url> that hundreds of acres in the greater Boston area had burned in the past week, with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state. Massachusetts averages 15 reported wildland fires each October; that number ballooned to about 200 last month. The AP reported that approximately 100 fires were reported over the last seven days of the month, and preliminary information indicated that all of them began with human activity, according to fire officials.</p><p>Per Healey's press release, the state's Department of Fire Services has been supporting local and regional firefighters with incident support units that provide mobile communications, conferencing, and mapping capabilities, as well as rehab units that support firefighter health and safety and drones and utility terrain vehicles. Local coordinators from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency are in contact with public safety officials experiencing large wildfires and are prepared to support needs as they arise.</p><p>The Massachusetts Air National Guard has repeatedly mobilized helicopters to conduct water drop operations. The Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation's Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry is assisting local fire departments with monitoring all active incidents, DCR fire towers are on full alert, and a temporary ban has been implemented on all open flame and charcoal fires at Massachusetts state parks.</p><p>Even with coordinated personnel, apparatus, and state agencies lending assistance, however, battling brush and wildland fires is labor-intensive, time-consuming, resource-heavy work. Dead and compromised trees, off-road apparatus, and drought-induced fire behavior all present additional hazards to the firefighters at these scenes. Citing that ongoing danger to firefighters and residents, the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts recommended on Sunday that all local fire chiefs deny any fire-related permit requests and collaborate with local officials to prohibit any recreational fire activity. Fire Chiefs have the authority to prohibit the use of open flames and other ignition sources in hazardous conditions under Section 10.10.2 of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code.</p><p>\"Given the current and expected weather conditions, the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts' Board of Directors strongly recommends that all our members temporarily deny all fire permit requests and work with municipal officials to impose outdoor fire bans in every city and town in Massachusetts at least through Friday, Nov. 8, 2024,\" wrote Foxborough Fire Chief Michel Kelleher, president of the Fire Chiefs Association of Massachusetts. \"The number and nature of these incidents pose a grave risk to our personnel and the communities we serve. Beyond the direct hazard posed by an out-of-control wildland fire, every firefighter battling a preventable outdoor fire is a firefighter who cannot respond to an unrelated structure fire, motor vehicle crash, medical call, or other emergency.\"</p><p>With no precipitation, winds of 5-10 mph, fresh leaf litter, and direct sunlight on surface fuels, the outdoor fire risk remained \"very high\" on Monday, the release said.</p><p>Forty-five percent of Massachusetts homes reside in or near wooded areas.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLINJN-ij800179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLINJN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DBY-JBT1-JBH5-P25C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2024 Wells Media Group, Inc.

According to news reporting out of Mohammed V University in Rabat by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"By combining geomatics techniques and remote sensing data, this paper gives a thorough investigation of the forest fires that occurred close to Berkane, Morocco, from July 16 to July 18, 2023. The goals of the study included spatiotemporally tracking the propagation of active forest fires during the fire season, and to accurately map the burned area and detect changes in vegetation cover caused by the fire.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Mohammed V University in Rabat: \"A detailed fire severity mapping of the impact of the fire on the forest was made by this integrated approach. We used remote sensing data from various sources, including NASA FIRMS data for the fire period and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery acquired two days before and one day after the fire, to accomplish these goals. In terms of estimating the burned area, our study produced important findings. We were able to estimate 3508.12 hectares, 3517.98 hectares, and 3113.63 hectares using satellite imagery with dNBR, dNDVI, and supervised classification, respectively. These results offer considerable potential for directing post-fire management plans and preserving this critically important forest area. The integration of FIRMS data, Sentinel-2 images, and GIS in our research highlights the need of using this coordinated strategy to conduct an accurate and thorough evaluation of forest fires in the area.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In addition to improving our understanding of forest fire dynamics, this study emphasizes the value of using cutting-edge geospatial and remote sensing techniques in attempts to manage wildfires and save the environment. The findings of this study will contribute significantly to guiding post-fire management strategies, thus promoting the conservation of the vital forest area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Integrated Geomatics and Remote Sensing Analysis of Forest Fire Propagation and Land Cover Change in Berkane, Morocco.

According to news reporting out of Sao Paulo, Brazil, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Mercury (Hg) emissions from forest fires, especially tropical forests such as the Amazonian forest, were shown to contribute significantly to the atmospheric mercury budget, but new methods are still necessary to improve the traceability and to reduce the great uncertainties related to this emission source. Recent studies have shown that the combustion process can result in Hg stable isotope fractionation that allows tracking coal combustion Hg emissions, as influenced by different factors such as combustion temperature.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), \"The main goal of the present study was, therefore, to investigate for the first time the potential of Hg stable isotopes to trace forest fire Hg emissions and pathways. More specifically, small-scale and a large scale prescribed forest fire experiments were conducted in the Brazilian Amazonian forest to study the impact of fire severity on Hg isotopic composition of litter, soil, and ash samples and associated Hg isotope fractionation pathways. In the small-scale experiment, no difference was found in the mercury isotopic composition of the samples collected before and after burning. In contrast, the larger-scale experiment resulted in significant mass dependent fractionation (MDF dHg) in soils and ash suggesting that higher combustion temperature influence Hg isotopic fractionation with the emission of lighter Hg isotopes to the atmosphere and enrichment with heavier Hg in ashes. As for coal combustion, mass independent fractionation was not observed. To our knowledge, these results are the first to highlight the potential of forest fires to cause Hg isotopic fractionation, depending on the fire severity.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results also allowed to establish an isotopic fingerprint for tropical forest fire Hg emissions that corresponds to a mixture of litter and soil Hg isotopic composition (resulting atmospheric dHg, DHg and DHg were -1.79 \u00b1 0.24\\x89, -0.05 \u00b1 0.04\\x89 and -0.45 \u00b1 0.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact of forest fire on the mercury stable isotope composition in litter and soil in the Amazon.

The fire department said shortly after midnight that firefighters found a body in a burnt building in the suburb of Vrilissia, but was unable to immediately provide further details. The blaze started Sunday near Lake Marathon, about 22 miles northeast of Athens, coursed across Mount Pendeli and reached the capital's northern suburbs. It burnt several homes and businesses in the suburbs and in communities near the lake. </p><p>Greece went on high alert but by late night Monday, a drop in winds offered hope and officials reported progress against the massive, fast-moving blaze that spawned flames over 80 feet high. Fire Department spokesperson Col. Vassileios Vathrakogiannis said firefighters were battling \"many active localized blazes,\" mostly around Marathon and Pendeli. The Marathon area was the site of a famous battle between Greeks and Persians in 490 B.C. and hosts a museum and archaeological site, but there were no immediate reports of damage to either. Greek firefighters were to be boosted by forces from other countries as early as Tuesday, after Athens sought international assistance, activating Europe's mutual civil protection mechanism. A blanket of smoke and ash shrouded central Athens while power cuts hit parts of the Greek capital and affected traffic lights at major central junctions. Authorities said at least 18 people were injured, mostly due to smoke inhalation as the blaze reached outlying sections of a suburb. Greece's National Observatory said late Monday that satellite images show the blaze has affected about 25,000 acres. France would provide a helicopter and 200 firefighters with 28 fire trucks, Italy two water-dropping planes and the Czech Republic 75 firefighters and 25 vehicles, officials said, while Serbia and Romania were also readying aid. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said it would dispatch two firefighting planes and a helicopter, while Spain was also finalizing reinforcements. The wildfire raced through pine forests left tinder-dry by repeated heat waves this summer. June and July were the hottest months ever recorded in Greece. An early start of the fire season this year has strained Greece's firefighting force. \"Firefighters have been working at full tilt for months,\" said Nikos Lavranos, head of Greece's main firefighters' union. \"They are exhausted.\" Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said Monday it was \"an exceptionally dangerous fire, which we have been fighting for more than 20 hours under dramatic circumstances.\" Some areas burning on Mount Pendeli were particularly hard to reach, he added. Three hospitals, including a children's hospital, two monasteries and a children's home were evacuated on Monday afternoon. Cellphones in the area got at least 30 push alerts warning people to flee. \"The wind would go in one direction and then in the other,\" said Spyros Gorilas, a resident of the area of Dioni who hosed down his house with water to save it from the flames. \"The smoke was suffocating. You couldn't see. Your eyes teared up. You couldn't breathe.\" \"Even the helicopter that dropped water, you couldn't see it,\" he added. \"You could only hear it.\" More than 700 firefighters, backed by 27 special wildfire teams, and armed forces personnel were battling the flames, with 190 vehicles, 17 water-dropping planes and 16 helicopters. Three Athens hospitals were on heightened alert, while paramedics and ambulances treated five firefighters for light burns and breathing problems, and at least 13 civilians. The Athens Medical Association warned those with chronic conditions, the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with respiratory and heart problems to be extra cautious. Greece's coast guard diverted all ferries from a nearby port serving several Aegean Sea islands, to another harbor. Sports halls and hotels were turned into evacuation centers. The police said 380 police officers assisted in evacuations, and helped move more than 250 people away from the path of the flames. It posted a video on social media showing officers carrying elderly people out of their homes to waiting vehicles against the backdrop of a flame-red nighttime sky. Authorities said some people who refused to leave their homes later became trapped and required rescuing, endangering the lives of firefighters. The affected areas  at the closest, some nine miles from the heart of Athens where the famed Acropolis and other archeological sites are located  typically have thousands of residents. However, it was unclear how many were away on vacation at the height of the summer season, and how many had obeyed the evacuation orders or stayed on their own to fight the blaze.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>AP Photo Volunteers battle fire in northern Athens Monday as firefighters tackle a major wildfire.

We`ll have the latest for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NANCY CORDES: How soon do you want to bring the tariffs on China`s --</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R) (President of the United States of America): Well, that depends on them.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: The faithful line up to pay their final respects as Pope Francis lies in state.</p><p>SETH DOANE: Can you describe your feeling when you were inside?</p><p>SARAH BORCHER (Visiting from Cincinnati): It was a little bit overwhelming.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: New Jersey faces what could become its worst wildfire in decades, with thousands of homes and businesses under threat.</p><p>ROB NOSTI (\"Liberty Door and Awning\" president): Pure devastation. You know, this is a complete start over.</p><p>REPORTER #1: The Tennessee Board of Parole is recommending a pardon for country music singer, Jelly Roll for crimes he committed before his music career.</p><p>REPORTER #2: Well, Chipotle is headed to Mexico. The American burrito chain has inked a deal to launch its first location in Mexico early next year.</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL (\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" host): I am excited for them to try what we think Mexican food is.</p><p>(Clip from \"Sunset Boulevard\" on Broadway)</p><p>REPORTER: The show must go on. Actor, Nicole Scherzinger grabbing a bull horn to belt out a tune from \"Sunset Boulevard\" when the sound system failed during yesterday`s Broadway matinee.</p><p>(Clip from \"Sunset Boulevard\" on Broadway)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This morning`s \"Eye Opener\" is presented by Progressive, making it easy to bundle insurance.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Well, that was yesterday at the matinee. Oprah and I went to the show last night. I`m still floating from what I saw from her on the stage last night. She is beyond, beyond good.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I`m excited. We`re going to go next week. So they got the lights working.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, because she is coming here.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: She`s coming here.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: They got the lights working by the evening.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, they did. I can`t wait for you guys to see the show. She`s amazing.</p><p>Hello, and welcome to CBS MORNINGS.</p><p>Today`s show is packed. I love days like this. Take a look -- don`t you?</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Oh, yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Oh.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I love days like this. Take a look at the lineup. Hugh Jackman, Smokey Robinson, and Chef Jose Andres, just to name a few.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: And also, it`s Tony`s turn in our series, \"Never Too Late,\" where you can watch a grown man learn how to swing a hammer and I`m not talking about Thor, but you will marvel at how good he looks.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I`m trying to figure out -- I`m trying to figure out what he was blowing.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Okay, a little -- a little saw dust in the arm here I find quite the aphrodisiac when you go home for the evening, I`ll say that.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Hey, now.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: All coming up in the eight o`clock hour.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Good morning to everyone at home.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Let`s get to the news, why don`t we? We`re going to begin with what appears to be good news, possibly a reversal from President Trump on the trade war with China, it could help the economy, it could help the markets.</p><p>Yesterday, the President appeared to be softening his tone on what had been some very steep China tariffs, but at the very same time, he hinted that more tariffs could be put in place unless countries make deals with the U.S. in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Ed O`Keefe is at the White House. He has been following this daily seesaw, the whiplash and the back and forth.</p><p>Ed, good morning to you.</p><p>On that subject, we`ve got China responding this morning. What are they saying now?</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: I`m still shaking my head about what you said about arm hair, Tony, but good morning.</p><p>Overnight, Beijing said that if the U.S. doesn`t start -- if he really wants to resolve this issue, it should cancel tariffs on China, and that comes as President Trump signals he is easing off his tough tariff policies in recent days, saying his administration`s talked with 90 countries about trade deals.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: What went down is coming back up. Stocks on the rebound around the world, President Trump signals high tariffs on China are set to end soon.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I get along very well with President Xi, and I hope we can make a deal.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: But it came with a warning to China and other countries that without a deal, the White House will set a price.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That will happen, I`d say over the next couple of weeks. Wouldn`t you say? I think so, over the next two, three weeks, we`ll be setting the number.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Trump`s moves come after weeks of global economic instability. This week, the CEOs of top retailers, Walmart and Target, privately warned the President tariffs could disrupt global supply chains to result in empty shelves in the coming weeks.</p><p>And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm nerves by telling a meeting hosted by JPMorgan Chase, there will be de-escalation with China.</p><p>On Wednesday, addressing leaders in international finance, he said the U.S. is merely trying to rebalance global trade.</p><p>SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): America first does not mean America alone. To the contrary, it is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: While President Trump says there`s been direct contact daily between the U.S. and China on trade --</p><p>(MAN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: This morning, China`s Ministry of Commerce pushed back, saying \"Any claims about the progress of China-U.S. trade negotiations are groundless as trying to catch the wind and have no factual basis.\"</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: And now 12 Democratic controlled states are suing the President to stop his tariffs. Arizona is one of the states, and its Attorney General called the tariffs insane and illegal, because the President can only set tariffs if there`s an extraordinary threat against the country. They argue there isn`t, and so that`s why they`re suing -- Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: All right, Ed, while we have you, you know, President Trump has made a career out of leveraging his personal brand, his personal name, but now there are new ethics questions around a meme coin that could lead to a private dinner with the President. What can you tell us about this?</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Yes, this is an interesting one. It has to do with the President`s meme coin, cryptocurrency, which got a major boost after its website posted an announcement offering a \"intimate, private dinner with President Trump\" at his golf club out in Virginia next month. The catch, it will go to 220 people who buy the most Trump cryptocurrency in the next few weeks, and the top 25 get to meet the President at a private VIP reception.</p><p>He launched the so-called meme coin just days before the inauguration, and is controlled by businesses linked to him, meaning the President stands to profit, at least on paper when the price increases.</p><p>The latest move of the President in this room has ethics watch dogs and Democrats crying foul. Senator Chris Murphy, for example, called it the most brazenly corrupt thing a president has ever done. Part of the concern, Tony is who exactly spends the money to get in the room with the President to try to influence him on policy? That`s what has people so concerned. And are they American business leaders? Are they someone else? Are they foreigners, potentially getting in there and getting some time with the President?</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Could be anyone.</p><p>Ed, thank you very much.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: All right, let`s move along to one of the conflicts abroad. The President is taking a tough line with Ukraine, accusing President Zelenskyy of undermining talks for a ceasefire with Russia.</p><p>Vice President J.D. Vance says Russia and Ukraine need to say yes to an American peace proposal or the U.S. will walk away.</p><p>Zelenskyy objects to giving up territory to Russia under the plan, and the war isn`t stopping. Overnight, Russia launched a deadly new attack on Ukraine`s capital.</p><p>Holly Williams has more.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: Russia killed Ukrainian civilians again last night, hitting residential areas according to Ukrainian officials. At least nine people lost their lives.</p><p>(OKSANA BILLAZIR speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: \"Diplomacy won`t work here,\" said Oksana Billazir (sp?). \"There simply aren`t words to express what a monster Vladimir Putin is.\"</p><p>But President Trump said yesterday that he`s not taking sides.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have no favorites. I don`t want to have any favorites. I want to have a deal done.</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: In the more than three years since Putin started this war, the U.S. has supported Ukraine with over $100 billion in aid, but now the White House says the President`s patience is wearing thin as he pushes a peace plan that reportedly involves excluding Ukraine from NATO membership, freezing the fighting close to the current frontline and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia.</p><p>The Russians seized Crimea by force the first time Putin invaded in 2014. Ukraine`s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says officially recognizing Russia`s occupation would be against his country`s constitution.</p><p>In February, the U.S. briefly suspended military aid to Ukraine after this fiery meeting at the White House.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don`t have the cards right now.</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: The fear in Ukraine is that if President Trump doesn`t get what he wants, the U.S. could permanently cut off its help.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>HOLLY WILLIAMS: The Trump administration`s peace plan reportedly also includes relief from sanctions for Russia. Now, some fear that rewarding Vladimir Putin with economic help and territory could encourage him to invade Ukraine again in the future or even target other countries -- Gayle.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Holly, thank you so much.</p><p>In Rome, the outpouring of people wanting to see Pope Francis lying in state is so big, so huge the Vatican had to keep St. Peter`s Basilica open all night long. Officially, nearly 50,000 mourners filed past the Pope`s coffin in the first 24 hours of public display. One of them was our senior foreign correspondent, Seth Doane.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>SETH DOANE: The masses today came in the form of the hushed faithful inching closer to have their moment with Pope Francis.</p><p>Sarah Borcher (sp?) is from Cincinnati and her family waited in line for five hours.</p><p>SETH DOANE: How has it struck you?</p><p>SARAH BORCHER: It struck me as there`s almost a sense of uncertainty. We don`t know who is going to be elected Pope next.</p><p>SETH DOANE: That`s what Cardinals meeting daily are starting to discuss.</p><p>JOHN ALLEN (\"Crux\" editor): Every papal Conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended.</p><p>SETH DOANE: John Allen is the editor of \"Crux,\" a news site specializing in the Vatican.</p><p>Is it too early to know if there are front runners?</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: It is never too early to talk about whether or not there are front runners.</p><p>SETH DOANE: In keeping continuity with Pope Francis` ministry, Allen says one bet would be the Vatican`s number two.</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: Cardinal Pietro Parolin, an Italian currently the Vatican Secretary of State.</p><p>SETH DOANE: He`s a tested top diplomat.</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: Another strong continuity candidate would be Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, currently the Cardinal of Bologna.</p><p>He was appointed by Pope Francis as his personal troubleshooter for the conflict in Ukraine, so he too has diplomatic experience.</p><p>Now, if you want a change, perhaps a change in a slightly more traditional conservative direction than Francis would be Cardinal Peter Erdo of Budapest in Hungary. Church lawyer by training, brilliant guy.</p><p>Another possibility would be Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, who is the cardinal with Kinshasa in Congo.</p><p>SETH DOANE: He also was vocal in pushing against Pope Francis` decision to bless same sex unions.</p><p>(WOMAN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>SETH DOANE: And for a compromise candidate --</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: Cardinal Pierre Batista Pizzaballa, who is currently the Latin right Patriarch of Jerusalem, meaning the top Catholic in the Holy Land. His name in Italian, literally means \"pizza dance.\" Imagine the memes should we get Papa Pizza Dance?</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>SETH DOANE: Now, he is a serious contender, in part because how he`s seen, really as someone who can help bridge divides in the Middle East. Now, this process of picking a Pope is intriguing, and one way of gaging interest, even in fictionalized form, take a look at the streaming figures for the film \"Conclave,\" up 283 percent on Monday after Pope Francis died -- Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, I plan to watch it in the days ahead. Seth Doane from Rome for us. Seth, thank you very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Turning now to a wildfire that has now burned more than 13,000 acres in Southern New Jersey. Firefighters are making progress, however, with containment now up to 50 percent, but officials warn this could still become the state`s biggest wildfire in decades.</p><p>Nikki Battiste is out there covering the story.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>MAN: It`s way bigger than I thought.</p><p>NIKKI BATTISTE: A growing wildfire in Southern New Jersey, sending plumes of smoke above neighborhoods in Ocean County has left some people who live there on edge, including Aimee Zettel who was allowed back home after an earlier evacuation order.</p><p>AIMEE ZETTEL (Lacey Township, New Jersey resident): It`s a nerve wracking feeling. It`s unsettling just because we could go back home. I didn`t even put any of my stuff back in the house. It`s like in the garage and bags, just in case.</p><p>NIKKI BATTISTE: While firefighters are finally starting to get control of the blaze that quadrupled in size in the span of 24 hours, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection says it could be the worst wildfire in 20 years.</p><p>BILL DONNELLY (New Jersey Forest Fire Service chief): Our objective is to starve the fire so that when the fire arrives into the area, there`s nothing left to burn.</p><p>MAN: Oh, it took a building on fire.</p><p>NIKKI BATTISTE: Multiple structures are in the path of the fire, which blackened and almost completely burned this home while reducing this small business to rubble.</p><p>ROB NOSTI You think you know what you`re going to walk into until you walk into it and it`s -- there`s not one thing that survived. It is pure devastation. You know, this is complete start over, but we will.</p><p>NIKKI BATTISTE: For CBS MORNINGS, Nikki Battiste, New York.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Smoke from that wildfire is spreading across multiple states, leading to some urgent air quality alerts. Meteorologist, Kate Bilo from CBS News, Philadelphia is tracking where it`s all headed.</p><p>Kate, good morning.</p><p>KATE BILO: Good morning to you, Tony.</p><p>Yes, here in Philadelphia, we are tracking that fire and that smoke plume very, very closely. In fact, as I kind of open the walls here, you can see a little bit of a haze over the city skyline here in Philadelphia. But let`s take a look at where the smoke is, of course, centered on that Jones Road Fire, which is just south of Toms River New Jersey.</p><p>And most of the smoke this morning, we`ve been seeing it kind of lift up into portions of Long Island in New York City. There is some indication that another plume of at least elevated smoke and haze could impact the I- 95 Corridor this afternoon, but with the southwest flow, it looks like Long Island, New York City will kind of be in that threat zone for air quality problems through today, and air quality alerts are in effect for this region.</p><p>We will eventually get some relief from this, luckily, as we head into the weekend, but the system that`s going to bring the relief, bring the relief is also bringing some problems, especially to portions of the Central and Southern Plains today.</p><p>We have an enhanced risk of flash flooding, where you see this yellow, basically from the Dallas0Fort Worth Metro right on up into portions of Nebraska, Kansas, where you see the yellow, that`s where storms are bringing heavy, heavy downpours, rainfall rates of an inch or two per hour, leading to the risk for flash flooding. You can see these big clusters of heavy storms.</p><p>This, though, is the same system that`s going to head into the northeast by the weekend, and it is going to produce a good soaking, which is great news for fire crews in our region.</p><p>Tony. I`ll send it back to you.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Kate Bilo for us. Kate, thank you.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: It is now day three of the retrial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of killing her police officer boyfriend.</p><p>Yesterday, the Court heard witness testimony, including from O`Keefe`s mother, speaking publicly about her son`s death. For the first time. Read has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p><p>Jordyn Jagolinzer from CBS News Boston reports.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>PEGGY O`KEEFE (John O`Keefe`s mother): He was bruised up. His eyes were closed. Just not a good scene.</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: Peggy O`Keefe described seeing her son, John, in the hospital where he was pronounced dead after he was found unresponsive in a snow bank, and then her interaction with his girlfriend, Karen Read.</p><p>PEGGY O`KEEFE: As I`m walking down, I hear Karen Read yell, \"Peg, is he dead? Is he dead, Peg? Peg, is he dead?\"</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: O`Keefe was found outside of another Boston police officer`s home in Canton in January 2022, where Read says she dropped him off at an after party the night of his death.</p><p>PEGGY O`KEEFE: She said, \"We went to a party. I left him there.\" I said, \"You just left him there?\" She said, \"Yes, I just left him there.\"</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: She said, after leaving the hospital, Read went to her boyfriend`s house.</p><p>HANK BRENNAN (Prosecutor): Was there any hugs? Condolences?</p><p>PEGGY O`KEEFE: No.</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: The Court also heard testimony from Kerry Roberts, a friend of O`Keefe`s who was with Read when they found his body in the snow.</p><p>KERRY ROBERTS (Friend): Karen pointed out and said, \"Look my tail light.\" And I said -- she said, \"Do you think I hit him?\" And I said, \"No, I don`t think you hit him. What are you talking about? Let`s just go find him.\"</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: The defense pressed Roberts when recalling the condition of Read`s broken tail light in her first conversation with police after O`Keefe`s death.</p><p>ALAN JACKSON (Defense attorney): You didn`t mention anything about a tail light or a cracked tail light, or having seen a cracked tail light?</p><p>KERRY ROBERTS: No, I did not. No, I did not. I didn`t want to accuse anybody of anything.</p><p>JORDYN JAGOLINZER: For CBS MORNINGS, I`m Jordyn Jagolinzer in Dedham, Massachusetts.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Coming up, how the investigation of the Gilgo Beach murders may have solved another murder mystery. We`ll have the latest on a case that goes back more than 25 years.</p><p>But first, it is 7:17, time to check your local weather.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Still ahead this morning, Hugh Jackman is on a mission to save the world that has nothing to do with Hollywood.

Ellen Quijano has more on this decades long mystery.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ELAINE QUIJANO: On Wednesday, investigators in New York announced a major clue in a nearly 30-year-old mystery.</p><p>STEPHEN FITZPATRICK (Nassau County, New York Police Department captain): Today, we`d like to provide an update on these identities of the two homicide victims who have historically been referred to by the nicknames \"Peaches\" and \"Baby Doe.\"</p><p>ELAINE QUIJANO: Nassau County Police say the woman known as \"Peaches\" is Tanya Jackson, a 26-year-old Army veteran, and \"Baby Doe\" her two-year-old daughter, Tatiana Dykes.</p><p>Jackson`s partial remains featuring a tattoo of a heart shaped peach were first discovered in June 1997 in a park near New York City. Then in 2011, in the midst of the Gilgo Beach murder investigation, police uncovered more of her remains, along with a young child believed to be her daughter.</p><p>Architect and Long Island native, Rex Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to killing seven women, six of whom were found near Gilgo Beach. But police say Jackson and Dykes may not be connected to Heuermann.</p><p>STEPHEN FITZPATRICK: Now, although Tanya and Tatiana have commonly been linked to the Gilgo Beach serial killings because the timing and locations of their recovered remains, we are not discounting the possibility that their cases are unrelated.</p><p>ELAINE QUIJANO: Investigators are asking the public for any information about their deaths.</p><p>ANNE DONNELLY (Nassau County, New York district attorney): We will never give up.

Here`s a look at how Jelly Roll got here and what comes next.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>(Clip from Billboard Music Awards/December 12, 2024)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Emotionally vulnerable lyrics like those are Jelly Roll`s signature.</p><p>(Clip from Stony Creek Records)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Stemming from personal experiences with drugs, crime, jail time, and a family history of addiction.</p><p>Starting at 14 years old, he spent a decade in and out of jail for drug possession, dealing, shoplifting and aggravated robbery.</p><p>JELLY ROLL (Singer): This is jail. It.

I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Even though the Tennessee Board of Parole recommended Jelly Rolls pardon, Governor Bill Lee will make the final call. Of course, we asked Governor Lee`s office when that will happen. A spokesperson said the Governor would follow a comprehensive review process, and added that he generally announces pardons annually in December.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I wish I could vote. I wish I could vote.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I think all of us do.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, there`s -- to me, there`s no way he`s not going to get that pardon. All that he`s done and what he is doing with his life and his music, and the life that he has -- the lives that he is changing now for the better.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: He says, it is more than just being a reformed man.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: It is the work he`s doing.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s right. He made some mistakes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: He is a great example.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: He is a great example.</p><p>GAYLE KING: He has paid for it. Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Hundred percent.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: All right --</p><p>GAYLE KING: We all agree, right?</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: We all agree, Governor Lee.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: We all agree, Governor Lee.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: All right, ahead, if you and your kids have student loans, you`ll want to keep watching, so stick around. We have the latest on the changes that could literally affect your paycheck.</p><p>This is CBS MORNINGS.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We are poised for big changes in this country when it comes to student loans, after the Department of Education said that borrowers need to pay up if they`re in default, that means that millions may soon see their wages garnished, and we`re not talking about a sprig of parsley on this one, millions who aren`t in default could see their payments go up. It`s a twofer.</p><p>Nancy Chen has more.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>NANCY CHEN: Have you always wanted to be a teacher?</p><p>COREY MASON (Student loan borrower): Yes, I wanted to do something that was going to make an impact on people, on my community, on the world.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL (Student loan borrower): It`s not about the paycheck, it would be nice if it was more, right? But that`s the heart of public service. It is doing it for others.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: Corey Mason and Rachel Dubreuil both teach at a public high school in Norwich, Connecticut. Their jobs requiring advanced degrees they say that forced them to take out tens of thousands of dollars in federal student loans.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL: You cannot miss a payment. That then jeopardizes other things that you have to pay for.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: For more than a decade now, repaying those loans on time has meant hard choices.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL: That`s how it should be spelled.</p><p>COREY MASON: Every extra penny I feel like I had went towards this debt.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: Those payments counted towards eventual debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. The deal: Work for the public sector and student loans would be canceled after 10 years or 120 payments.</p><p>To make their payments more affordable, the teachers enrolled in a program known as SAVE which based their loan payments on their incomes.</p><p>But last summer, the program was blocked in court, leaving its roughly eight million borrowers in jeopardy. Payments also no longer counted towards debt forgiveness.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL: And it was essentially frozen, like our progress was frozen at that point. We`re literally living in this limbo of not knowing where the paperwork is. There`s no phone number, no fax number, no e-mail for them.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: As they look to enroll in a new plan, more trouble.</p><p>In February, the Department of Education took down online applications for all income driven repayment plans for five weeks. All the applications are now back online, there are processing delays, and Court documents show an outstanding backlog with no clear timeline to clearing it.</p><p>In the meantime, borrowers like Dubreuil and Mason are left not knowing when their loans will be forgiven, both within just five payments of the required 120.</p><p>What does it mean to be that close and be in limbo right now?</p><p>COREY MASON: It`s like heartbreaking. We`ve been working so hard towards like finally being able to say, okay, this debt is done.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL: And then now to literally be in the last inches of it and to have it just -- the floor fall out from under us is very painful.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: The Education Department said the applications were taken down to revise the forms, and it expects loan providers to resume processing by May 10th. But some advocates say the backlog could still take months or even years to clear.</p><p>MIKE PIERCE (Student Borrower Protection Center executive director): This is chaos.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: Mike Pierce heads Student Borrower Protection Center, which has filed a lawsuit against the Education Department On behalf of the Union that Dubreuil and Mason belong to.</p><p>What happens to them now?</p><p>MIKE PIERCE: They`re stuck in limbo. These public service workers who are doing everything we`ve asked of them, serving in our communities, are stuck in debt, even though they have a legal right to be debt free.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: These teachers hope for the loan forgiveness they`ve worked towards, but if it doesn`t come.</p><p>RACHEL DUBREUIL It would be catastrophic, because I don`t know where it would come from. We have a little bit of like emergency savings, but beyond that, I don`t know what we would do.</p><p>NANCY CHEN: The turmoil happens against the backdrop of steep job cuts in the Education Department, nearly half its workforce.</p><p>On top of that, the President plans to move the student loan program to a different agency altogether, a potentially seismic shift as financial futures hang in the balance.</p><p>For CBS MORNINGS, Nancy Chen, New York.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Coming up, the stories that you`ll be talking about, including an update on the health of Carlos Santana, that`s coming up next in \"What to Watch.\" But right now, it is 7:43, time to check your local weather.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>GAYLE KING: We have a lot coming up for you in our eight o`clock hour, including Oscar nominated actor, Hugh Jackman.</p><p>(Clip from Global Citizen Now/2024)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Only on CBS MORNINGS -- just arrived.

She`s been following this. Jo Ling, good morning.</p><p>JO LING KENT: Tony, good morning.</p><p>This is an alarming one. The FBI says there were more than 850,000 complaints last year alone and Americans lost a record $16.6 billion and that is up 33 percent, 33, from the year before.</p><p>Now the group targeted the most, probably no surprise here, people 60 and older who lost nearly $5 billion. Phishing and spoofing scams where cyber criminals are tricking you into divulging that personal information by pretending to be someone else were the most reported internet crimes in 2024, followed by extortion and personal data breaches.</p><p>Officials say with the rise of crypto currency, it can take just mere taps to rob virtual exchanges -- Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: So Jo Ling, how can people avoid being victim of these various scams?</p><p>JO LING KENT: Good question. It`s really simple. The FBI urges people to check, call, wait before clicking on any links that you receive or making any payments.</p><p>Exactly. So check e-mail addresses and phone numbers to make sure they`re correct. You want to call a known number that you know is legit to ensure an e-mail is real and it`s for something that you want to be replying to, and then you want to wait to verify that your money is going to the intended recipient.</p><p>This is also -- it also goes when a known source maybe suddenly changes their payment or wire instructions. You want to watch out for that, and you want to also make sure that the request is not coming from a spoofed e-mail or number. So double, triple, quadruple check everything -- guys.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Really, really, great advice. This is a serious business. Jo Ling, thank you very much.</p><p>GAYLE KING: This just happened to me yesterday.

Doesn`t that matter?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes, but it is --</p><p>GAYLE KING: You have other talents.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: But it is supposed to be innate in us to use our hands and build and fix things.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: When the plumber comes over and he takes me down to show me something and explain it, I hate the little I have to pretend like it`s all going in here, and I`m like, \"Yes, okay.\"</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Because on the inside, we feel like, go, right ahead, do whatever you want, Mr. Man. That`s what we feel like.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes. Yes, uh-huh. That`s true.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: For real.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Is it like that?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes. I feel like helpless lady, you know what I mean? When I should be fixing it myself.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes. Yes. All I can do is get you a glass of water. I mean, I should be able to handle more than that.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Not that women are helpless. I`m not saying that. I`m just saying that`s how I feel.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Me too.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I don`t mind you bringing me a glass of water.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: By the way, that house, the bird house I built, I`m putting it on sale.</p><p>GAYLE KING: We have it here, okay.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: $1.2 million if anyone wants it. It`s going to be in Brooklyn.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Going to be in Brooklyn. That sounds about right.</p><p>All right, dreams don`t stop with us, though. We want to hear from you the viewer, so head over to NeverTooLate.CBSNews.com, and you can submit a 30 to 6-seconnd video explaining your \"Never Too Late\" story.

Chef and humanitarian, Jose Andres is here to share his new book about the benefits of compassion.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Here he is.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: He is with Gayle right now, and we`ll be right back. Stick around.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(Clip from \"Chef`s Table: Legends\"/Netflix)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: That, of course, is award winning Chef Jose Andres cooking up one of his favorite dishes in the upcoming Netflix show, \"Chef`s Table: Legends.\"</p><p>Legends, in his new book, this legend, it is a book called \"Change the Recipe: Because You Can`t Build a Better World Without Breaking Some Eggs.\" It shares lessons he has learned during his decades in the kitchen.</p><p>I`m happy to say Jose Andres joins us now.</p><p>Good to have you here.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES (Chef and \"Change the Recipe\" author): Happy to be back. Thank you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: A legend. I love that the recipes in this book are for people who don`t even have a kitchen, just a microwave, and I love the concept of changing the recipe, which is something cooks do all the time based on what`s available, as a metaphor for making adjustments in your life to get through it.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Yes, but the lessons began in the kitchen. How many times we tried to do a recipe from a cookbook and we freak out because we are missing one, two, or three ingredients.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: And with this mentality, actually you adapt, because the plan is going nowhere. So learn to adapt. Change the recipe, make the recipe your own.</p><p>And if you bring this idea to life, all of a sudden, things happen.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That`s good.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Because you don`t commit to what is put in front of you, you just keep moving forward.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: That`s great advice.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You describe yourself as you said, I`m just a cook. You are so much more than that. We all know, but you`ve got many life lessons from your mom and your dad, and one of the best I thought from your dad was master the fire. Because you were thinking you were in charge of fire. I can do more than this, but your dad said, you first need to master the fire, which means many things, Jose.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: My mom was a nurse. My father was a nurse. She loves to cook for us, Monday through Friday. My father was a weekend cook. The big paella pan.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: He will invite everybody. He put me in charge of making the fire. I wanted to cook. He says, no. I got upset. He sent me away.</p><p>He called me on the site and told me, \"My son, everybody wants to do the cooking. Everybody wants to steal the pot. But actually what is essential is that you control the fire.\"</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: \"Control the fire, and you can make anything you want with your life.\" Again, a lesson of cooking, but it`s a metaphor for life itself.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yeah, and life hasn`t always been easy, but you talk about remaining nimble and adjusting to life as it happens. You`ve dealt with some difficult times, a difficult period for yourself in your World Central Kitchen team. Last year, seven workers were killed in an Israeli airstrike attack in Gaza, and you faced these difficult conditions while delivering meals in Ukraine.</p><p>What have you learned about yourself? What have you learned about the people that you work with through some of these difficult times?</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Well, all of these people, obviously, are heroes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: They are.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: They put their comfort of their lives on the side. I think this was my daughter Ines, who, one day as we were going into Ukraine, and I didn`t want to bring her with me, she says, \"Daddy, how are we going to be changing the world without taking some risks?\"</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: I can stay home in the comfort of everything you`re providing for us, but we are there next to the people --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: -- when they need this the most, or nothing will ever change.</p><p>GAYLE KING: But Jose you write in this book, she said -- your daughter said, \"Nobody changes anything from the comfort of their home.\" But sometimes you say you don`t like taking no for an answer, and sometimes you question what you`re doing yourself even today.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Well, the no for an answer, I think that was my mom. She was super stubborn.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And then you said, \"I`m like my mom.\"</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Because a mom, when she wants to provide for the children, she`s never going to take no for an answer.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: So this is probably another lesson I learned from my mom. I didn`t have the best relationship with her.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>JOSE ANDRES: Maybe a lot of people, they see themselves in me, but my mom was everything. She will give herself, to my brothers, to my father, to friends. She never took no for an answer, especially when beyond the horizon you can help somebody.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Well, Chef Jose Andres, thank you so much for joining us, and you are stubborn in the most beautiful way.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Because you are doing beautiful work in this world, and we deeply appreciate you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: \"Change the Recipe\" is on sale now, as Gayle says, run, don`t walk to get it.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: It`s amazing.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(LOCAL NEWS)</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>*************************************************************************** ** (08:30 AM, EDT)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: All week, CBS MORNINGS Deals is taking over \"Talk of the Table\" for our Spring Into Savings event.</p><p>This morning, we have more products at bigger discounts, up to 91 percent.

This is what you call a Hugh sandwich. My plan is working. My plan.</p><p>Hugh Evans, Hugh Jackman, oh, my God. A girl could dream.</p><p>We will be right back. We will be right back.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes, that just happened. Local news and local weather coming right up.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(Clip from Global Citizen Festival/2024)</p><p>GAYLE KING: I was there. I remember that moment. \"Goosebumps.\"</p><p>That`s Coldplay`s Chris Martin and Ed Sheeran at last year`s Global Citizen Festival. So think about this: For more than 13 years, Global Citizen has helped deliver $49 billion with a B to end extreme poverty.</p><p>Next Wednesday in New York, Global Citizen now returns for its fourth summit, bringing together leaders, artists and advocates, including Wyclef Jean, Rachel Brosnahan, Liza Koshy and Hugh Jackman.</p><p>Only on CBS MORNINGS and we love when that happens, Global Citizen ambassador, Hugh Jackman and Global Citizen co-founder and CEO, Hugh Evans, I like to call you guys Hugh Squared. Hugh Squared.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN (Actor and Global Citizen Ambassador): We`re even matching.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Matching.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: We are wearing the uniform/</p><p>HUGH EVANS (Global Citizens CEO and co-founder): Matching. Coordinated, but it worked out.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You got the memo. But guys, let`s go back 13 years ago, when I first heard about you, you were like 12 in the Jackman apartment where literally, you`re sitting in the living room in a circle, and you were talking about this festival, and your idea was just one Hugh at the time in Central Park just one. Thirteen years later, where are you?</p><p>HUGH EVANS: Well, I mean, the movement to end extreme poverty has grown so rapidly over the last 13 years, this year and over the next 18 months, Global Citizen is going to be on five continents for the first time ever.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>HUGH EVANS: We`re taking Global Citizen to Brazil with the first ever Global Citizen Festival focused on raising a billion dollars to protect and restore the Amazon. We are scaling up our partnership with FIFA to produce the world`s first ever halftime show for the World Cup Final.</p><p>We`re also expanding Global Citizen into Asia and our Move Africa Initiative, and in partnership with the European Commission and the Gates Foundation, we`re seeking to raise $6.2 billion to save eight million children`s lives in support of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance in Brussels this June.</p><p>So the movement is well and truly all over the world now.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I know Hugh, we can`t help but smile when he`s talking. What is it about this organization, and what the two of you do together? Because people say, look, I`m just one person. The poverty problem is too big. How can I make a difference? And to that, you say what? Because you`ve been there from the very beginning as well.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Yes, well, I met Hugh many -- he was 12 when I met him, but when I met him, I was just like, oh, this is a visionary who sees a way forward where everyone can participate. It doesn`t matter if you have money, it doesn`t matter what age you are, it doesn`t matter anything, if you want to make a difference, you can.</p><p>And now, that`s grown into having a Global Citizen app. You can just get the app and you can -- if you have one minute in your day, you can make a difference. And you were there with me in my living room --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, yes.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: And there`s just something so exciting when you see a way forward, because everyone wants to help what`s happening -- you know, what`s happening in our world today, and we can, as a race, as a humanity, we can actually make a difference.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I did not know, after all of these years, knowing that you were a P.E. teacher. I didn`t know that.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: For a little bit.</p><p>GAYLE KING: For a little bit.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Yes, when I was on my gap year after high school, I went, and I sort of was a teacher at a school called Uppingham in England, and they used to throw me into the P.E. classes. Don`t tell the parents they were paying an exorbitant amount of money to educate their kids, that an 18- year-old was teaching.</p><p>HUGH EVANS: That`s awesome.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I bring this up because you guys are doing a panel next week where you both talk about education being the great equalizer. And so what experience did that teach you about the power of education and the work that you`re doing today for both of you?</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: For me, my dad was one of my biggest inspirations. And my dad always said, education, get education. When I had a job, I was given an opportunity to be on a successful soap opera in Australia or to go to drama school. It was clear, because of my dad, go and learn. Feel that you can turn up anywhere and do the thing you love to do. So the power of education has been instilled in me, and also the power of giving back.</p><p>And so that`s what I love, what the focus is here. There`s 250 million kids out of school right now.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: And around the world and it doesn`t matter what you believe, I know the whole world believes in that power of education.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And you have a new --</p><p>HUGH EVANS: That`s why next week, we`re bringing everyone together for Global Citizen Now, and doing our panel focused on the power of education to change the world.</p><p>GAYLE KING: We`ll see, we always know, you know a mind is a terrible thing to waste. We know this and the and there is power in knowing. Knowledge is power. That`s one thing that you all teach all the time. But I want to talk, before you go about your new theater company. I heard it`s called Together.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Yep, Together. Together Productions with Sonia Friedman and director, Ian Rickson, and we`ve been brewing this for five years, and we wanted to create a community, a place where everyone can come and see great theater that is stripped down, a little more bare, that is affordable and immediate.</p><p>And we`re going to do over the next two or three months, just 43 performances. We`re going to do two plays out there.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, I love this. \"Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes.\"</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like that.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Get ready.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like that.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: It is a great play, and I`m doing that with Ella Beatty, and then Liev Schreiber, Maggie Sue and Justice Smith are going to do \"Creditors,\" the Strindberg play, and we`re going to do readings. It`s going to be great down at the Minetta Lane Theatre.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I will, I will come. I will come.</p><p>HUGH JACKMAN: Please come.</p><p>GAYLE KING: September is the big concert. What are you most excited about the big festival, Hugh?</p><p>HUGH EVANS: I think this year, the thing I`m most excited about is that, you know, we -- in a world that sometimes feels so hopeless.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>HUGH EVANS: I think there`s so much cause for optimism. You know, the world is getting better. When I was born in 1983, fifty-two percent of the planet lived in extreme poverty. Prior to the pandemic that was down to less than 12 percent of the world`s population.</p><p>So never believe this lie that you can`t make a difference. If we work together as Hugh said, if you download the Global Citizen app --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>HUGH EVANS: When 12 million members come together, we can convince world leaders to make multibillion dollar pledges to end extreme poverty, and that`s at the heart of everything we do at Global Citizen.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Bravo. Bravo, Hugh. Bravo, Hugh. Bravo, Hugh.</p><p>Hugh also, when he said, when I was born in 1983 -- congratulations.</p><p>Coming up next, music legend, Smokey Robinson is in the house.</p><p>Oh, and he`s still on the road. We love this. We`ll be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Music legend, Smokey Robinson came out with the song --</p><p>GAYLE KING: \"Quiet Storm\"</p><p>NATE BURLESON: -- \"Quiet Storm\" 50 years ago.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I love that.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: But the singer, songwriter and producer isn`t just looking back. The 85-year-old is out with a new album, \"What The World Needs Now.\" Here`s a sneak peek of his rendition of \"Be Thankful For What You`ve Got.\"</p><p>(Clip from \"What The World Needs Now\"/Smokey Robinson/Gaither Music Group)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: It`s great.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: The incredibly talented, living legend, Smokey Robinson, good morning.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Where is our applause button?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That`s right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Oh my Gog. Yay.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: That`s right. There it is.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Smokey, good morning.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON (Singer): Good morning.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Good morning.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: How are you guys doing?</p><p>NATE BURLESON: You called this album inspirational. What do you want to inspire?</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: I want people to be inspired to care about each other and to love each other and to be happy -- like that song \"Be Thankful\" that you just played.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: That was the last song that we recorded for this record, and the reason being is that I heard it many, many years ago by William DeVaughn, okay, but when I first heard it, I thought it was about a pimp, you know, \"Diamond in the back, sunroof top. Diggin` the scene with a gangsta lean.\"</p><p>I thought, oh, I wasn`t paying -- I just love the beat of it and the melody and all of that. I`m not paying attention to what he is saying, until maybe a couple months before we got off into recording this particular album, because they sent me a list. My publishing partners in New York, Primary Wave, had sent me a list of inspirational songs. And so I got a chance to - -</p><p>GAYLE KING: Like, \"Lean On Me.\" \"What a Wonderful World.\"</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: All of them.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: All the greats.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes, you know, but then I thought about the William DeVaughn song, which is about, be thankful for what you`ve got, because there`s always someone who has less.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I know. I know.</p><p>NATE BURLESON: Yes.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: And it`s a great message.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And appreciate what you have.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Absolutely.</p><p>GAYLE KING: But Smokey, we`re also excited to see you, because you sit here at 84 or 85? 84 or 85?</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Supposedly, 84 or 85. One of those.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Still on the road performing and still loving what you do so much still.</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: Yes, that`s why I do it, Gayle, because I can`t find anything that replaces it for me.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>(Clip from Smokey Robinson)</p><p>SMOKEY ROBINSON: You know, I retired for three years one time, and after three years, I was climbing the walls.

According to news reporting out of Seoul, South Korea, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based monitoring systems to ensure proper emergency response during natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Ministry of Education. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Sejong University: \"This paper proposes a real-time UAV monitoring system for responding to forest fires or floods. The proposed system consists of a hardware part and a software part. The hardware configuration is an embedded camera board mounted on the UAV, a Qualcomm QCS610 SoC with cores suitable for running deep learning-based algorithms. The software configuration is a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model for detecting fires or floods. To execute the model in real time on edge devices with limited resources, we used a network slimming technique which generates a lightweight model with reduced model size, number of parameters, and computational complexity. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated on the FLAME dataset consisting of forest fire images and the FloodNet dataset consisting of flood images.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The experimental results showed that the mIoU of slimmed DeepLabV3+ for FLAME is 88.29%, and the inference speed is 10.92 fps. For FloodNet, the mIoU of the slimmed DeepLabV3+ is 94.15%, and the inference speed is 13.26 fps. These experimental results confirm that the proposed system is appropriate for accurate, low-power, real-time monitoring of forest fires and floods using UAVs.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Semantic Segmentation Network Slimming and Edge Deployment for Real-Time Forest Fire or Flood Monitoring Systems Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

According to news originating from Nanchang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The moisture content of fine dead surface fuel in forests is a crucial metric for assessing its combustibility and plays a pivotal role in the early warning, occurrence, and spread of forest fires. Accurate prediction of the moisture content of fine dead fuel on the forest surface is a critical challenge in forest fire management.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education Graduate Innovation Fund. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Jiangxi Normal University: \"Previous research on fine surface fuel moisture content has been mainly focused on coniferous forests in cold temperate zones, but there has been less attention given to understanding the fuel moisture dynamics in subtropical forests, which limits the development of regional forest fire warning models. Here, we consider the coupled influence of multiple meteorological, terrain, forest stand, and other characteristic factors on the fine dead fuel moisture content within the subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest region of southern China. The ability of five machine learning algorithms to predict the moisture content of fine dead fuel on the forest surface is assessed, and the key factors affecting the model accuracy are identified. Results show that when a single meteorological factor is used as a forecasting model, its forecasting accuracy is less than that of the combined model with multiple characteristic factors. However, the prediction accuracy of the model is improved after the addition of forest stand factors and terrain factors. The model prediction ability is the best for the combination of all feature factors including meteorology, forest stand, and terrain.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The overall prediction accuracy of the model is ordered as follows: random forest &gt; extreme gradient boosting &gt; support vector machine &gt; stepwise linear regression &gt; k-nearest neighbor. Canopy density in forest stand factors, slope position and altitude in terrain factors, and average relative air humidity and light intensity in the previous 15 days are the key meteorological factors affecting the prediction accuracy of fuel moisture content. Our results provide scientific guidance and support for understanding the variability of forest surface fuel moisture content and improved regional forest fire warnings.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning-Based Predictive Models for Fine Dead Fuel Moisture of Subtropical Forest in China.

According to news reporting originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, tragedies caused by forest fires have been frequently reported. Forest fires not only result in significant economic losses but also cause environmental damage.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Chinese Academy of Forestry; Zhejiang Science And Technology Major Program on Agricultural New Variety Breeding; Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"The utilization of computer vision techniques and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forest fire monitoring has become a primary approach to accurately locate and extinguish fires during their early stages. However, traditional computer-based methods for UAV forest fire image segmentation require a large amount of pixel-level labeled data to train the networks, which can be time-consuming and costly to acquire. To address this challenge, we propose a novel weakly supervised approach for semantic segmentation of fire images in this study. Our method utilizes self-supervised attention foreground-aware pooling (SAP) and context-aware loss (CAL) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, serving as substitutes for manual annotation. SAP collaborates with bounding box and class activation mapping (CAM) to generate a background attention map, which aids in the generation of accurate pseudo-labels. CAL further improves the quality of the pseudo-labels by incorporating contextual information related to the target objects, effectively reducing environmental noise.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We conducted experiments on two publicly available UAV forest fire datasets: the Corsican dataset and the Flame dataset. Our proposed method achieved impressive results, with IoU values of 81.23% and 76.43% for the Corsican dataset and the Flame dataset, respectively. These results significantly outperform the latest weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) networks on forest fire datasets.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Weakly Supervised Forest Fire Segmentation in UAV Imagery Based on Foreground-Aware Pooling and Context-Aware Loss.

fan flames, spur water saving</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New York has urged its 8.5 million residents to save water as America's biggest city endures an unprecedented period without significant rainfall, creating potentially dangerous drought conditions and fanning the flames of deadly wildfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since Friday, wildfires have burned through thousands of acres on the border between New York and New Jersey, just an hour from Manhattan, claiming the life of an 18-year-old firefighter battling the blazes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the New York side, officials said the fire was the largest on record since 2008, fueled by dry winds.</p><p>New York and other parts of the state north of the city are under a red flag warning for bush and forest fires with high winds, low humidity and dry conditions creating tinderbox conditions.</p><p>There was even a small fire over the weekend in New York's Prospect Park, a large green space in the city's densely populated Brooklyn borough, although it was quickly extinguished.</p><p>\"The reality is, the drought that we're currently experiencing is just one example of how a changing climate is impacting our state today, not far off into the future, but right now,\" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.</p><p>New York City and the surrounding region have gone without significant rainfall for much of September and October, and November has been mostly dry so far.</p><p>- Perfect storm -</p><p>The drought-like conditions have coincided with a major overhaul of New York's water supply system, which has seen the city source more from a reservoir in Catskill Park, located in an area particularly affected by the dry conditions.</p><p>\"While there is plenty of water in our reservoirs now, we are working to start public conservation efforts now in case this drought continues,\" the city's department of environmental protection said in a statement.</p><p>More from this section</p><p>From 'Little Marco' to 'Mr Secretary': Rubio shows Trump China push</p><p>Prehistoric 'bird brain' fossil reveals evolution of avian intelligence</p><p>'London's best-kept secret': UK's largest wholesale market turns 50</p><p>The city's fire department has called on residents to flag leaking fire hydrants so they can be closed, warning in an Instagram post that \"an open hydrant can release more than 1,000 gallons per minute.\"</p><p>New York City's average daily water demand has decreased by approximately 35 percent in recent decades, but officials say more can be done to avoid waste, calling on residents to only flush toilets when necessary and to take shorter showers.</p><p>The reservoirs relied on by the city, which are usually filled by rainfall in October and November, are only 62 percent full -- far less than the normal level of about 79.2 percent.</p><p>The Office of Natural Lands Management said that the ground in parts of New Jersey was dry almost eight inches down -- the worst situation in more than 100 years -- meaning it would require that many inches of rainfall to bring the soil back to saturation.</p><p>There is no rainfall forecast in the area this week, and parts of New York have imposed a drought watch -- two steps below a drought emergency at which point homes and businesses are forced to restrict water use.\u00a0</p><p>Drought-hit areas of New Jersey are already one notch above New York's, at the drought warning stage.</p><p>\"The impact of this on wildfires cannot be overstated,\" said Greg McLaughlin, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, which has responded to 537 wildfires so far this year -- 500 more than in the same period last year.</p><p>Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said it had been over 20 years since a similar drought episode in the northeastern United States.</p><p>\"One of the attributes that is starting to come out (with climate change) is these rapid transitions from either very wet periods to very dry periods, or very dry periods to very wet periods,\" he said.</p><p>gw/sst</p><p>Originally

The Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 2 will take command of the complex of fires at 6am on Wednesday, Aug. 30 and will be based out of Randle, WA. A community meeting is being planned for next week.</p><p>A strong cold front is passing through the region today bringing with it increasing moisture and rainfall. This will help reduce fire activity. However, gusty winds are expected with the passing front, which may increase fire activity.</p><p>Fire suppression resources are being committed only where they have high probability of success and can operate safely and effectively. Firefighters continue to engage with fire suppression efforts on numerous fires around the forest making headway on containment on several of the new fires. Resources assigned to these fires now exceed 250 personnel with additional support anticipated in the coming days.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/giffordpinchot/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1135017\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/giffordpinchot/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1135017</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4522570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692M-XPH1-JDKC-R10B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"228\"/><timeReceived>6:22 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd.
