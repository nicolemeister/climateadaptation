Regional officials said 55 fires were active on Sicily, amid temperatures in the 40s Celsius. In Puglia, further north, some 2,000 tourists were evacuated from three hotels in Vieste as flames got perilously close.</p><p>But in Italy's northern Lombardy region, a powerful storm accompanied by heavy hail caused flooding and power outages and was blamed for the death of a 16-year-old girl at a scouts' camp.</p><p>In southeastern France, fire crews fought scattered wildfires, including one near Arles in Provence involving 300 firefighters and a water-dropping helicopter. Authorities banned access to several forested areas along the French Riviera and in Corsica.</p><p>In Turkey, authorities evacuated a dozen homes and a hospital as a precaution on Tuesday after a wildfire raged through a rugged forest area near the Mediterranean resort of Kemer, in Antalya province.</p><p>Another wildfire in the western province of Manisa, was brought under control a day after it burnt at least 14 homes.</p><p>___</p><p>Gatopoulos reported from Athens.

These feedstocks in part come from the waste generated in large forest fire prevention activities to reduce risk of wildfires that have become a critical challenge in California in recent years.\u00a0 This project will produce a commercial grade bioethanol, while at the same time contributing to the reduction of carbon released into the atmosphere from the massive wildfires that have severely impacted the environment and residents in California.</p><p>The parties are committed to develop a first project then continue to expand their cellulosic ethanol footprint within California and to other locations all around North America, utilizing local woody biomass materials to supply low-carbon biofuels into the North American market.</p><p>\"Allotrope is excited to continue its efforts to develop a series of advanced biofuels projects in California in partnership with Sumitomo and Axens,\" noted Marc Stuart, CEO of Allotrope Partners LLC. \u00a0\"Axen's Futurol\u2122 \u00a0technology is ready for commercial scale roll out and Sumitomo will be a valuable partner across the entire project development process, from feedstock sourcing to the sale of final products into the markets.\"</p><p>Bioethanol is currently attracting attention in countries worldwide striving for carbon-neutral societies as a renewable energy source and as a feedstock for biofuels such as SAF*1 and bio-chemicals. Cellulosic bioethanol made from woody biomass is classified as \"Advanced Bioethanol*2\" by the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) program and \"Cellulosic Fuel\" by the US EPA Renewable Fuel Standard, which has the potential to scale sustainably, and with low Carbon Intensity when compared to other fuels and blending components available on the market today.</p><p>\"The commitment from the Allotrope and Sumitomo teams to deploy Axens Futurol\u2122\u00a0 technology at multiple US plants and to utilize a wide variety of woody biomass feedstocks is another great example that the low carbon marketplace values both the flexibility of the Futurol\u2122 technology and Axens' significant technology de-risking achievements. We believe each organization brings complementary strengths to this relationship, and, together, we can make meaningful contributions to reduce the Carbon Intensity of the transportation sector, utilizing ethanol as a renewable energy carrier for gasoline blending and potentially SAF and bio-chemicals production,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Balligand, Vice Pesident, Axens Renewables Product Line.</p><p>Accordingly, the three companies will be studying the possibility of an initial plant to produce about 60,000 tons of bioethanol derived from local feedstocks. The project shall consider carbon recycling initiatives that contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society, such as CCU*2 using carbon-neutral, biogenic CO2 generated naturally during bioethanol production, internal energy production, and effective utilization of residues from the fermentation process including Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) production.</p><p>\"SCOA is pleased to partner with Axens and Allotrope in this landmark project and will contribute to this study by consolidating and applying the knowledge and skills of the Sumitomo Corporation Group acquired through various businesses. This includes the development and deployment of carbon-free energy using hydrogen, ammonia, and next-generation biomass, raw fuel gas, and by promoting the use of green chemicals to construct a circular economy,\" said Sandro Hasegawa, General Manager, SCOA EIIA.</p><p>About Allotrope Partners LLC</p><p>Allotrope Partners LLC invests in projects and companies engaged in the clean economy transition.

Hawkeye Pictures &amp; Some Canadian 2021</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a common reaction for those unfamiliar with settler-colonialism to be stunned by the harsh reality of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. The greatest strength of the award-winning documentary My Tree (2021) directed by Jason Sherman is its unassuming nature. The film embodies how many people feel when they first learn about the human rights violations Israel has committed under the guise of achieving statehood. With nearly two hours of impactful content, My Tree forces the audience to consider the impact that settler-colonialism has on not only the people who are forcibly displaced by its violence, but also the environment that is altered by it.</p><p>Jason takes the audience on a journey of self-discovery to find the tree that link s a person and a place together. In his childhood home in Toronto, Canada, during the 1970s, it was routine for Jason's Jewish parents to make a modest donation to the Jewish National Fund (JNF). Accordingly, as part of his bar mitzvah, Jason was gifted a JNF 'Tree Certificate' announcing that a tree would be planted in his name in Israel. The certificate states, ' For over 70 years, the Jewish National Fund has performed miracles in changing Israel's swamps, desert, and rock beds into land on which farms and settlements have prospered. '\u00a0</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>[embedded content] [embedded content]</p><p>As an adult, Jason received little support from the JNF in his quest to learn about his 'bar mitzvah' tree. Therefore, he decided to track down his tree on his own volition. During his search across Israel-Palestine, Jason discovers that the JNF was created to raise funds for settlement projects. 'Blue Boxes' for donations were a tool to help promote the Israeli state. The first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, supported this endeavor, famously commanding, ' Cover every land with trees, make the desert bloom.' People from around the world became inspired to help change the desert ecosystem into forests. However, what contributors to the JNF didn't realize is that the transformation of the landscape would displace Palestinian villages.</p><p>Since its founding in 1901, the JNF has planted over 250 million trees across nearly 250,000 acres in Palestine to solidify Israel's rule over the land.\u00a0 An estimated 600 villages have destroyed since 1948. Ninety of these villages are buried beneath JNF parks, one of them named 'Canada Park,' where Jason surmises that 'his tree' was likely planted.</p><p>When Jason arrives in Tel Aviv, he wonders what his tree might have contributed to the developed ecosystem. What he discovers is the devastating consequences these JNF-planted forests have had on the land's natural ecosystem. He also discovers a growing internal moral unease that seeks resolution, and it is this feeling that becomes the new focus of his quest.\u00a0</p><p>During the film, Jason speaks with Ishai Schuster, a gardener for Kibbuts Mefalsim, and learns that the most commonly planted tree by the JNF is the Aleppo pine, Pinus halepensi \u2014 which can be detrimental to the environment if grown in large numbers. Pine has shallow root systems that make them unstable, and branches that consistently fall, damaging structures nearby. These trees also produce ample amounts of sap, which is extremely flammable. The risk of forest fire was horrifically demonstrated by the 2010 Mount Carmel fire that burned about 12,000 acres and resulted in the deaths of 44 people.</p><p>Recently, the film My Tree was used as a catalyst for conversation during an online film salon hosted by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voicesfromtheholyland.org/\">Voices from the Holy Land (VFHL)</url>  on July 16 . The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voicesfromtheholyland.org/online-film-salon-videos/online-film-salon\">discussion</url>  was moderated by Iymen Chehade, an adjunct professor of Middle Eastern History at Columbia College Chicago and founder of Uprising Theater. In addition to Jason Sherman, the panel comprised Seth Morrison, treasurer for Jewish Voice for Peace; and Mazin Qumsiyeh, founder and director of the Palestine Museum of Natural History and the Palestine Institute for Biodiversity and Sustainability at Bethlehem University.</p><p>Quimsiyeh, emphasized that the creation of Canada Park represents much more than a preference for pine trees, it is an effective weapon for enacting settler-colonialism. 'Replacement theology in the colonizing context, of course, involves replacing the people and reshaping the landscape.' Quimsiyeh further explained that the JNF's planting campaign is an extension of the 1948 Nakba. '[Israel] uprooted not only the towns, the homes, the people, but they also uprooted trees around those villages, both domestic trees and wild trees.'</p><p>Throughout the film, Jason is frustrated by JNF's lack of support to help him in his search for his 'personal' tree. He wonders, 'Why is it so hard to talk about trees?' It isn't until he meets with Eitan Bronstein Aparicio, the founder of Zochrot\u2014meaning 'we remember'\u2014that he discovers the truth. Jason learns that Israel forcibly displaced and demolished three Palestinian villages\u2014Beit Nuba, Imwas, and Yalu\u2014to ultimately rename the location 'Canada Park.' The pines planted in this park are part of JNF's effort to cover up war crimes.</p><p>During VFHL's July salon, Seth Morrison discussed his experience on the Washington, D.C. Board of the Jewish National Fund and why he publicly resigned from the role. Morrison explained that when he had initially begun working for the JNF, he was led to believe by colleagues that the organization was no longer dealing with Palestinian land. After learning that this was not true, he resigned and shared his experience with the public. Although he was removed from the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies and lost many friends, Morrison remains committed to his decision. 'The only way to deal with Zionism is to directly oppose it,' he said to the salon's audience.</p><p>As the film persuasively discusses, JNF's forests help Israel to avoid questions about the morality of establishing a settler state in a land that already had a thriving, indigenous population. As Aparicio explains, if those questions are asked then 'you must question your very foundation.' This haunting statement prompts the viewer of the film to look internally and ask, 'What might be my own hidden history, and how do I reconcile with those discoveries to support justice for others?'</p><p>Reconciling with his own hidden history, Jason speaks with Mohyeddin Abdulaziz, a Palestinian-American activist who grew up in Imwas before his family was forcibly displaced from their village by Israeli soldiers. Abdulaziz shares with Jason how he contends with the creation of Canada Park in the wake of his village's destruction. 'The thing that is much harder is that [visitors] come to have fun,' he references the park's contributor plaques, stating, 'And it's therethe names [of the people] [who gave] money to celebrate my destruction.' Mohyeddin shares with Jason that he hopes one day they will be able to return to Imwas and build a new home for his family. 'I hope that one day we'll plant other trees together with our own will,' Mohyeddin says as he shakes Jason's hand.</p><p>Voices from the Holy Land's film salon on Jason Sherman's My Tree allowed 300 registrants to talk with the film's director and participate with an expert panel discussing the events surrounding the film.

The train was traveling in the Valencia region last night when the driver decided to reverse course because of the wildfire advancing from around the town of Bej\u00c3\u00ads, farther east. Some passengers got off the train when it stopped in the countryside, including ones who broke windows to escape, officials said. </p><p>Ten people were injured, Spanish state news agency Efe reported. The government of Castell\u00c3\u00b3n province today tweeted a video of firefighters running for their lives as towering flames from the Bej\u00c3\u00ads fire roared behind them. The wildfire is one of two still raging out of control in eastern Spain. South of Valencia city, a bigger fire around the Vall d'Ebo area has forced more than 1,500 people to evacuate towns and villages since the weekend. Valencia regional President Ximo Puig said today that the Bej\u00c3\u00ads fire had a perimeter of some 30 miles and had burned some 10,000 acres. He said the Vall d'Ebo blaze had a perimeter of 50 miles and had scorched some 28,000 acres. The European Forest Fire Information System says 679,000 acres has burned in wildfires so far this year in Spain. That's more than four times the country's annual average of 165,000 acres since 2006, when records began. In neighboring Portugal, authorities said they hoped to bring under control a wildfire that has burned for 12 days and scorched large swaths of pine forest in the Serra da Estrela Natural Park. However, officials warned that a new heat wave forecast for the area could complicate the task. Smoke from the Portugal fire reached Spain's capital, Madrid, about 240 miles to the east, yesterday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000182ac06de84abbefe77c5af0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CT-WVN1-DY7N-F00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 17, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CA1V</classCode><className>TRAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX307</classCode><className>MADRID, SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC324</classCode><className>PORTUGAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting originating from Canberra, Australia, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The McArthur grassland and forest fire danger indices, widely used in Australia, predict six fire danger classes from 'Low-Moderate' to 'Catastrophic.' These classes were linked to the rate of fire spread and difficulty of suppression. However, the lack of rate of fire spread data, especially for elevated fire danger classes, has hindered improvement of the McArthur methodology or an alternate approach.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Australian National University, \"We explored the relationship between fire danger classes and burned areas (derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument) within six climate zones during the 2000-2016 Australian fire seasons. A negative binomial linear regression model was used to explore this relationship. The fire danger classes demonstrated a corresponding increase in burned area from 'Low-Moderate' to 'Very High' classes in Australia's inland regions. The elevated fire danger classes did not contribute to this trend. In coastal regions, the satellite-derived burned area showed no relationship between fire danger classes and satellite-derived burned area. We used accumulated burned area from the daily MODIS product, which could be subjected to lagged detection as observed in the Kilmore East fire.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Thus, the satellite-derived total burned area may not be a suitable metric for informing the McArthur fire danger classes across Australia.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Relating Mcarthur Fire Danger Indices To Remote Sensing Derived Burned Area Across Australia.

It needs to be encouraged and allowed to spread. We are not talking about a brush or forest fire. We are not talking about a chemical fire. </p><p>We are talking about a spiritual resurgence driven by young college students, and it is taking on a life of its own. I touched on the revival at Asbury University in an earlier article, but it deserves a deeper dive into the movement spreading across the country. My writing today is not a story about civil disobedience that we have become used to expecting. This story is about singing, praying, and surrendering oneself to Christ in round-the-clock revivals. This is a truly amazing phenomenon. The gathering at Asbury University is not the first in the institution's history. On February 3, 1970, a religious service morphed into a revival that lasted 144 hours. The current revival had a simple beginning on February 8th. After a regularly scheduled service, a group of about twenty students lingered and continued to sing and pray for each other. As the hours passed, other students heard the music and payers coming from the hall, and they stopped and joined in. The crowd soon swelled and occupied every one of the 1,500 folding chairs, and people stood around the hall and filled the balconies. They were not just observers but became active worshipers. Over the next two weeks, over 50,000 people will have come to Asbury to be a part of a modern religious phenomenon. Not to mimic Asbury, but occurring organically, there are similar services at many other colleges around the country, including Samford University, Lee University, and Cedarville University. The core of this movement, both its leadership and target audience, is the Gen Z students who have been present since the beginning. Unlike many of the Gen-Z generation who live on Instagram and TikTok, this group has been turning away the media and keeping the event low-key and low-tech. Tucker Carlson of FOXNews had requested to attend and was asked not to come to Asbury. This is not a political event, and they did not want to distort the serenity of the gathering with the presence of high-profile media personalities. Professional revivalists and Christian celebrities have been welcomed but have not been given a platform. The student leaders have done nothing to disrupt or corrupt the event. This event has no props. There are no special lights, video presentations, or planned offerings. This is purely between the worshipers and Jesus. Students who have been interviewed outside of the hall are overcome with emotions. They genuinely feel they have been changed by being a part of the service. It is hard to define a word to describe what is happening. It is not an event, service, revival, or any other term used to describe something planned. This has mushroomed from two dozen kids who went to a service and needed something more. They found it in Kentucky, and the world has taken notice.

'This study, which is the first of its kind in the world, provides fresh evidence supporting a connection between air pollution and cognition.' <br/>For the study, the researchers briefly exposed 25 healthy adults to diesel exhaust and filtered air at different times in a laboratory setting. Brain activity was measured before and after each exposure using functional MRI, or fMRI. <br/>The researchers analyzed changes in the brain's default mode network (DMN), a set of inter-connected brain regions that play an important role in memory and internal thought. The fMRI revealed that participants had decreased functional connectivity in widespread regions of the DMN after exposure to diesel exhaust, compared to filtered air. <br/>'We know that altered functional connectivity in the DMN has been associated with reduced cognitive performance and symptoms of depression, so it's concerning to see traffic pollution interrupting these same networks,' says Jodie Gawryluk, PhD, a psychology professor at the University of Victoria and the study's first author. 'While more research is needed to fully understand the functional impacts of these changes, it's possible that they may impair people's thinking or ability to work.' <br/>Notably, the changes in the brain were temporary and participants' connectivity returned to normal after the exposure. Carlsten speculates that the effects could be long lasting where exposure is continuous. He says that people should be mindful of the air they're breathing and take appropriate steps to minimize their exposure to potentially harmful air pollutants like car exhaust. <br/>'People may want to think twice the next time they're stuck in traffic with the windows rolled down,' says Carlsten. 'It's important to ensure that your car's air filter is in good working order, and if you're walking or biking down a busy street, consider diverting to a less busy route.' <br/>While the current study only looked at the cognitive impacts of traffic-derived pollution, Carlsten says that other products of combustion are likely a concern. <br/>'Air pollution is now recognized as the largest environmental threat to human health, and we are increasingly seeing the impacts across all major organ systems,' says Carlsten. 'I expect we would see similar impacts on the brain from exposure to other air pollutants, like forest fire smoke. With the increasing incidence of neurocognitive disorders, it's an important consideration for public health officials and policymakers.' <br/>Featured image: fMRI shows decreased functional connectivity in the brain following exposure to traffic pollution. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-023-00961-4\">https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-023-00961-4</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://axisimagingnews.com/imaging-insights/imaging-research/traffic-pollution-impairs-brain-function\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ALID13922716746559159982587610000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALID-139227</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67D5-W4G1-JCMN-Y0ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567499</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><timeReceived>2:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday.</p><p>\u201cI want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there\u2019s a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\u201d Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \u201cWithout rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Evacuating such a large number of people is \u201cgoing to be tough,\u201d but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said.</p><p>Westwick said later Thursday that water bombers were used to fight the fire. \u201cThey\u2019ve been successful in completing drops and doing their part to limit the spread\" of the fire.</p><p>Jennifer Young, director of corporate affairs for the Northwest Territories' Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, said 10 planes left Yellowknife on Thursday with 1,500 passengers.</p><p>The hope is to have 22 flights leave on Friday with 1,800 more passengers, and flights could potentially still be leaving on Saturday, she said.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control.</p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.nt.ca/ecc/en/services/wildfire-update\">268 wildfires</url> have already burned more than 21,000 square kilometers (8,100 square miles).</p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.</p><p>\u201cIt's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\u201d because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.</p><p>Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really anxious and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m emotional ... I'm in shock,\u201d she told The Canadian Press. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m coming home to or if I\u2019m coming home. There\u2019s just so much unknowns here.\u201d</p><p>At the Big River Service Station about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \u201cphenomenal,\u201d employee Linda Croft said. \u201cYou can't see the end of it.\u201d</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC that their car began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle began filling with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cI was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\u201d said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times.</p><p>She said her son kept saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, mommy.\u201d</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation and pledged to provide any support needed.</p><p>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website.</p><p>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can\u2019t find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta. The closest of those centers is more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) by road from Yellowknife.</p><p>Officials in Calgary said they're preparing to take in thousands of evacuees, and are opening a reception center at the Calgary airport, where five evacuation flights were expected to arrive Thursday.

About 120 people needed medical treatment, with two people - one civilian and one firefighter - suffering serious injuries, Fernandes said.<br/>Water-dumping planes helped 1,300 firefighters combat the worst of the blazes in the nation's central area, while another 1,000 worked to bring other fires under control.<br/>The European heat wave is also sparking flames in Spain and France - and in Turkey at the other end of the Mediterranean.<br/>More than 800 firefighters battled two wildfires in the region outside Bordeaux in southwest France, according to the regional emergency service. The fires began Tuesday near the towns of Landiras and La Teste-de-Buch, and firefighters hadn't been able to contain them by Wednesday morning.<br/>About 6,500 people have been evacuated from campgrounds and villages in the forested area. The number of injuries is unclear. The two fires have destroyed more than 4,400 acres of terrain. Images from firefighters showed flames racing through thickets of trees and grassland, fanned by strong winds, and smoke blackening the horizon.<br/>The regional administration banned activity in forested areas at risk. Several regions in southern France are on fire alert because of hot, dry weather and high winds. Wildfires swept through the Gard region in southeast France last week.<br/>Portugal has long experienced fatal forest fires. In 2017, wildfires killed more than 100 people. No one has died in a wildfire since then as Portugal improved its forest management and firefighting strategies.<br/>The Atlantic country is sweltering under a spike in temperatures that is forecast to send thermometers in the central Alentejo region to 115 degrees today.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8081363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65XJ-M121-JBSN-029P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Columbian Publishing Co.

Westwick urged residents in other areas to leave by noon Friday.</p><p>\u201cI want to be clear that the city is not in immediate danger and there\u2019s a safe window for residents to leave the city by road and by air,\u201d Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference. \u201cWithout rain, it is possible it will reach the city outskirts by the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Evacuating such a large number of people is \u201cgoing to be tough,\u201d but people were cooperating and staying calm, Westwick said.</p><p>Westwick said later Thursday that water bombers were used to fight the fire. \u201cThey\u2019ve been successful in completing drops and doing their part to limit the spread\" of the fire.</p><p>Jennifer Young, director of corporate affairs for the Northwest Territories' Department of Municipal and Community Affairs, said 10 planes left Yellowknife on Thursday with 1,500 passengers.</p><p>The hope is to have 22 flights leave on Friday with 1,800 more passengers, and flights could potentially still be leaving on Saturday, she said.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year \u2014 contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. \u2014 with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 137,000 square kilometers (53,000 square miles) from one end of Canada to the other, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> As of Thursday, 1,053 wildfires were burning across the country, more than half of them out of control.</p><p>In the Northwest Territories alone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.nt.ca/ecc/en/services/wildfire-update\">268 wildfires</url> have already burned more than 21,000 square kilometers (8,100 square miles).</p><p>Thursday's evacuation of Yellowknife was by far the largest so far this year, said Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta.</p><p>\u201cIt's one of those events where you need to get people out sooner rather than later,\u201d because fire could block the only escape route before ever reaching the community.</p><p>Resident Angela Canning was packing up her camper with important documents, family keepsakes and basic necessities and leaving with her two dogs, while her husband stayed behind as an essential worker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really anxious and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m emotional ... I'm in shock,\u201d she told The Canadian Press. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m coming home to or if I\u2019m coming home. There\u2019s just so much unknowns here.\u201d</p><p>At the Big River Service Station about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Yellowknife, the line of vehicles waiting for fuel was \u201cphenomenal,\u201d employee Linda Croft said. \u201cYou can't see the end of it.\u201d</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already been forced to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>A woman whose family evacuated the town of Hay River on Sunday told the CBC that their car began to melt as they drove through embers, the front window cracked and the vehicle began filling with smoke that made it difficult to see the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cI was obviously scared the tire was going to break, our car was going to catch on fire and then it went from just embers to full smoke,\u201d said Lisa Mundy, who was traveling with her husband and their 6-year-old and 18-month-old children. She said they called 911 after they drove into the ditch a couple of times.</p><p>She said her son kept saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, mommy.\u201d</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened an urgent meeting with ministers and senior officials Thursday to discuss the evacuation and pledged to provide any support needed.</p><p>Authorities said the intensive care unit at a Yellowknife hospital would close within 24 hours as the Northwest Territories health authority starts to reduce its services. In-patient units from Stanton Territorial Hospital would be moved in the coming days, if required, and most long-term care patients were transferred to institutions to the south, the Health and Social Services Authority said on its website.</p><p>Officials said evacuations have so far been safe and orderly, and that evacuees from Yellowknife who can\u2019t find their own accommodations can get support in three centers in the province of Alberta. The closest of those centers is more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) by road from Yellowknife.</p><p>Officials in Calgary said they're preparing to take in thousands of evacuees, and are opening a reception center at the Calgary airport, where five evacuation flights were expected to arrive Thursday. A second center has been set up at a hotel for those who drive to the city, said Iain Bushell, the city\u2019s director of emergency management.</p><p>Only those who cannot leave by road should register for the evacuation flights, officials added. People who are immunocompromised or have conditions that put them at higher risk also were encouraged to sign up.</p><p>\"We\u2019re all tired of the word unprecedented, yet there is no other way to describe this situation in the Northwest Territories,\" Premier Caroline Cochrane posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. She urged residents to obey emergency management officials, traffic control devices and posted speed limits.</p><p>The evacuation order issued Wednesday night applies to the city of Yellowknife and the neighboring First Nations communities of Ndilo and Dettah.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-indigenous-land-first-nations-impact-3faabbfadfe434d0bd9ecafb8770afce\">Indigenous communities</url> have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Officials in British Columbia, where about 370 fires were burning, also braced for more evacuations, with the weather forecast for the next few days predicting dry lightning that could spark new blazes and brisk winds that could change direction quickly.</p><p>Cliff Chapman, director of provincial operations at the province's Wildfire Service, urged anyone at risk to pack a \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d bag and to respect any evacuation orders.</p><p>The U.S. has also seen devastating wildfires, including fires last week on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-wildfires-recovery-maui-lahaina-identifications-4e444bc0217bc1e0779f87e641a1b235\">Hawaiian island of Maui</url> that killed more than 100 people and destroyed a historic town.</p><p>Rural areas near California\u2019s border with Oregon were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/northern-california-wildfire-evacuations-9bfba7e1c43aedb040d4c153ce3789a2#:~:text=HAMBURG%2C%20Calif.,national%20forest%20lands%2C%20authorities%20said.\">placed under evacuation orders Wednesday</url> after gusty winds from a thunderstorm sent a lightning-sparked wildfire racing through national forest lands, authorities said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-ca509a053f45f3797b93286f94d6b19820230818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YS-Y5W1-DYMD-655P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1158\"/><timeReceived>2:51 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Forest fires are the type of natural disaster that strike with sudden destructiveness and are often difficult to control. That's why working to prevent forest fires and the damage they cause to natural resources - as well as people's property and sometimes human life - is a priority for Dahua Technology.</p><p>This press release features multimedia.

Dahua's technology fully integrates video perception systems with integrated sky and ground monitoring methods to form a strong \"fire net\" aimed at prevention and early, decisive intervention when needed.</p><p>The Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon is the largest and deepest canyon on earth. The terrain of the canyon forest area is complex, steep and deep, with precious and diverse vegetation ecological resources, and is very difficult to protect. Dahua Technology helped build a smart forest fire prevention monitoring system, safeguarding forests through digital technology. Based on thermal imaging technology, the system provides 360\u00b0 long-distance monitoring and uninterrupted 7/24 protection, guarding the vast forests and lush mountains.</p><p>In Chibi City, Hubei, Dahua Technology built an integrated forest fire prevention system for Guantangyi Forest Farm. The system uses dual-spectral thermal imaging to detect fires in real time, links video feeds to command centers, and connects alarms on fire ranger's handheld devices, through to a six-rotor UAV that monitors the situation from above. The seamless flow of information through this system enables forest rangers to rush to a target area with a patrol terminal in hand to conduct on-site command, fire search and rescue, and other first responder functions.</p><p>It takes integrated capabilities working together to save forests, and Dahua solutions make it possible. Dahua employees take special pride in being able to contribute to this mission; for example, \"When I walked through many forested areas in the country, every time I was not only emotional, but also felt responsible. Dahua Technology has always been involved in forest fire prevention. In the future, the company will continue to use technology to protect the ecology and intelligence to guard a green future.\"</p><p>View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210518005588/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210518005588/en/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Media<br/>Vivid Gu<br/>18969121820<br/><url normalizedValue=\"mailto:PR_Global@dahuatech.com\">PR_Global@dahuatech.com</url></p></bodyText></contact><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Dahua Solution Safeguarding The Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon (Photo: Business Wire)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWIRE-20210518005588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62PJ-N9N1-JBG1-82RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7924</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><timeReceived>1:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Business Wire, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Business Wire</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com\">http://www.businesswire.com</url><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 18, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The same was true for June.</p><p>Most Brazilian blazes are manmade, often started illegally by land-grabbers clearing forest for cattle or crops.

That drew global criticism of the response from the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly called for development of the region.</p><p>This year, it\u2019s the Cerrado savanna stretching across Brazil\u2019s center-west region that is suffering more than usual. An area almost as big as Connecticut and New Jersey burned there in the first seven months of 2021.</p><p>Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said in a July 27 online panel that there have been fewer Amazon fires this year due to cool weather, which limits fire's potential to spread. But deforestation remains on par with the last two years, so much dry material remains on the ground waiting to be burned, she added.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid about the coming months,\u201d said Alencar, who is also coordinator of MapBiomas Fogo, which compiles data on deforestation and fires across the region. \u201cWhen this cold front goes away, the vegetation will be drier and then we will have warmer temperatures. ... I\u2019m not sure that the people who cut down the forest will not light it.\u201d</p><p>Citing heightened hazard due to Brazil\u2019s worst drought in nine decades, the Justice and Environment ministries on July 22 announced a task force to prevent and investigate fires in 11 states of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Some 6,000 people, including federal and state police and firefighters, as well as state public security and environmental officials will participate in the effort, according to a statement.</p><p>On June 29, Bolsonaro decreed <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-caribbean-brazil-business-deforestation-0a6f2d09206cb28831ffab6d6efb0ce2\">redeployment of soldiers to the Amazon to combat fires</url> and deforestation, and also issued a 120-day ban on unauthorized outdoor fires.</p><p>Similar measures in previous years didn't prevent illegal fires, however. More than 90% of the Pantanal hot spots detected in 2020 came after a similar presidential ban, according to Vin\u00edcius Silgueiro, coordinator of territorial intelligence at the Center of Life Institute in Mato Grosso state.</p><p>\u201cThe sense of impunity is very high. Enforcement is well below what is necessary,\u201d Silgueiro said.</p><p>In Mato Grosso state, half of whose territory is in the Amazon, the federal and state governments last year began coordinating actions to put an end to overlap that frequently left other areas unmanned and vulnerable, according to Mauren Lazzaretti, the state's environment secretary.</p><p>The state is also purchasing a helicopter and plans to deploy dozens of planes loaned by Pantanal farmers and businesses to drop fire retardant onto blazes.</p><p>Last year, over 4 million hectares (about 15,000 square miles) of the Pantanal went up in flames, or about 27% its area \u2014 by far the most since official record-keeping began in 2003. While the biome regenerates quickly, unlike rainforest, fires often kill local wildlife, such as jaguars, caimans and giant otters.</p><p>\u201cThe size of the fires last year drew society's attention to the component of individual responsibility,\u201d Lazzaretti said. \u201cThe engagement of cities, farmers and even traditional and Indigenous communities is much greater this year.\u201d</p><p>The year before, fires in the Amazon roused global concern, and several European governments openly criticized Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Bolsonaro countered that fires nationwide and in the Amazon, while up from 2018, were roughly in line with the average of the preceding several years and were down sharply from 15 years earlier. He called on European leaders to mind their own backyards.</p><p>Earlier studies showed the Amazon absorbs about 2 billion of the 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide the world emits into the atmosphere each year, making it an important part of the global effort <url normalizedValue=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Flatin-america-ap-top-news-brazil-international-news-climate-change-384fdb5ee7654667b53ddb49efce8023&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDBiller%40ap.org%7C7c724d0e75144176a67e08d952ad8328%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C637631727482306772%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sPkIpoQYJ%2F%2BrxS5YD%2FUnw6oraz28dnk6RO9TZzBLigA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">to curb climate change</url>. But a study led by the Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, published in Nature on July 14 \u2014 spanning 10 years and involving nearly 600 flyovers \u2014 found the dry season's intensification and increased deforestation had caused more fires and higher carbon emissions. The southeastern part of the Amazon, particularly ravaged by logging, has become a net source of carbon.</p><p>Paulo Artaxo, professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said other recent studies have shown even the more preserved western Amazon region is now carbon neutral in terms of emissions, while a few years ago, it was a carbon sink.</p><p>Carlos Nobre, a prominent climatologist, says Brazil\u2019s Amazon is nearing a \u201ctipping point,\" after which the thick jungle will cease to generate enough moisture to sustain its current form and will begin transforming into tropical savanna.</p><p>Nobre said Bolsonaro's government has yet to demonstrate any encouraging change in approach to help save the rainforest.</p><p>The federal government \u201ccontinues incentivizing organized crime in the Amazon that is responsible for the theft of timber, illegal deforestation and fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who practice these crimes haven't given any sign of worry that enforcement will become rigorous.

The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of hundreds in the past week across Greece, gobbling up pristine pine forests as well as homes and businesses and forcing hundreds to quickly evacuate by sea to save their lives.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit and turned its prized pine forests into bone-dry tinderboxes.</p><p>In a televised nationwide address, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the destruction in Evia and elsewhere \"blackens everyone's hearts\" and pledged compensation for all affected, as well as a huge reforestation and regeneration effort. He also apologized for \"any weaknesses\" shown in addressing the emergency, a nod to criticism from some residents and officials who said Greece's firefighting efforts and equipment were woefully inadequate.</p><p>\"These last few days have been among the hardest for our country in decades,\" Mitsotakis said. \"We are dealing with a natural disaster of unprecedented dimensions.\"</p><p>With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia's beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats.</p><p>\"We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\" David Angelou, who had been in the seaside village of Pefki, said Sunday night after leaving by ferry to the mainland.</p><p>\"You could feel the enormous heat, there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then, nothing else around,\" he said.</p><p>Mitsotakis said Monday he \"fully understands\" the pain of those who lost homes or property, and the anger of those seeking airborne assistance \"without knowing whether the firefighting aircraft were operating elsewhere or whether conditions made it impossible for them to fly.\"</p><p>But he urged Greeks to reflect \"not only on what was lost but also on what was saved in such an unprecedented natural disaster.\"</p><p>Other big wildfires were still burning Monday in Greece's southern Peloponnese region. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) have been burned. Power cuts on Monday affected at least 17,000 households.</p><p>The causes of the blazes are as yet undetermined, though several people have been arrested for alleged arson. Greece's top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to criminal activity.</p><p>More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to Greece's call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower.</p><p>On Monday, Greece's Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey - Greece's historic regional rival - will be sending two firefighting planes because a top envoy said Turkey's wildfires \"are now under control.\" The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters.</p><p>Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and Aug. 8.</p><p>Some residents ignored the orders to try to save their villages, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini firebreaks.</p><p>\"The villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,\" said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria.</p><p>\"If they had evacuated their villages, as the civil protection told them to, everything would have been burnt down \u00e2 \" perhaps even two days sooner,\" he said. \"Of course, they never saw any water-dropping aircraft. And of course now the conditions are wrong for them to fly, due to the smoke.\"</p><p>On Monday, the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages even as 600 firefighters struggled to tame the inferno, aided by emergency teams from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia, 5 helicopters and 5 water-dropping planes.</p><p>One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week while four more were in the hospital Monday, two in critical condition with extensive burns.</p><p>Wildfires were also burning in southern Italy, North Macedonia and Montenegro, where a large fire in the Malo Brdo district of the capital Podgorica was coming close to houses on Monday.</p><p>In Italy, authorities urged the public to be careful with fire amid a heat wave forecast for this week, when many Italians take summer vacations. Firefighters for weeks have been battling blazes in Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria, and two have died.</p><p>\"We have faced very difficult and dramatic days fighting fires, and the temperatures that are forecast require the utmost attention,'' said Fabrizio Curcio, head of Italy's Civil Protection agency. \"We are asking the maximum collaboration and caution from citizens ... to avoid any behavior that can set off a fire and report immediately the smallest blaze.\"</p><p>In North Macedonia, dozens of wildfires followed the worst heat wave in decades.

The award is announced every year on 23rd January, the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. The award carries a cash prize of Rs. 51 lakh and a certificate in case of an institution and Rs. 5 lakh and a certificate in case of an individual. Under the guidance of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Shri Amit Shah, the country has significantly improved the disaster management practices, preparedness, mitigation and response mechanisms resulting in significant reduction in casualties during natural calamities.</p><p>For the award of year-2023, nominations were solicited from 1st July, 2022 onwards. The award scheme for the year 2023 was given wide publicity through print, electronic and social media. In response to the award scheme, 274 valid nominations were received from institutions and individuals.</p><p>Following is a summary of the outstanding work of the winners of 2023 Award in the field of Disaster Management:</p><p>Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA), was established in 1999 in the aftermath of the Super Cyclone. OSDMA embarked on multiple initiatives including raising of the Odisha Disaster Response Action Force (ODRAF), Multi-hazard Early Warning Service (MHEWS) framework, and a cutting-edge technology-enabled web/smartphone-based platform called \"SATARK\" (System for Assessing, Tracking, and Alerting Disaster Risk Information based on Dynamic Risk Knowledge). OSDMA provided effective response during various cyclones, Hudhud (2014), Fani (2019), Amphan (2020) and Odisha floods (2020). OSDMA conducted disaster preparedness initiatives in building community resilience in 381 tsunami prone villages/wards and 879 multi-purpose cyclone/ flood shelters located within 1.5 km from coastline.</p><p>Lunglei Fire Station, Mizoram, responded efficiently and effectively to a massive forest fire which was reported on 24 April 2021 in the uninhabited forest areas that surrounded Lunglei town and spread to more than 10 village council areas. Lunglei Fire Station personnel assisted by local civilians worked continuously for more than 32 hours during which they motivated and provided on the spot training to residents. Due to the valiant, brazen and prompt efforts of Fire and Emergency staff in the putting out the flames, there was no loss to life and property and the spread of fire to other parts of the State was prevented.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125680566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CR-K281-DYTH-G0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 23, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That drew global criticism of the response from the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly called for development of the region.</p><p>This year, it\u2019s the Cerrado savanna stretching across Brazil\u2019s center-west region that is suffering more than usual. An area almost as big as Connecticut and New Jersey burned there in the first seven months of 2021.</p><p>Ane Alencar, science director at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, said in a July 27 online panel that there have been fewer Amazon fires this year due to cool weather, which limits fire's potential to spread. But deforestation remains on par with the last two years, so much dry material remains on the ground waiting to be burned, she added.</p><p>\u201cI am afraid about the coming months,\u201d said Alencar, who is also coordinator of MapBiomas Fogo, which compiles data on deforestation and fires across the region. \u201cWhen this cold front goes away, the vegetation will be drier and then we will have warmer temperatures. ... I\u2019m not sure that the people who cut down the forest will not light it.\u201d</p><p>Citing heightened hazard due to Brazil\u2019s worst drought in nine decades, the Justice and Environment ministries on July 22 announced a task force to prevent and investigate fires in 11 states of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Some 6,000 people, including federal and state police and firefighters, as well as state public security and environmental officials will participate in the effort, according to a statement.</p><p>On June 29, Bolsonaro decreed <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-caribbean-brazil-business-deforestation-0a6f2d09206cb28831ffab6d6efb0ce2\">redeployment of soldiers to the Amazon to combat fires</url> and deforestation, and also issued a 120-day ban on unauthorized outdoor fires.</p><p>Similar measures in previous years didn't prevent illegal fires, however. More than 90% of the Pantanal hot spots detected in 2020 came after a similar presidential ban, according to Vin\u00edcius Silgueiro, coordinator of territorial intelligence at the Center of Life Institute in Mato Grosso state.</p><p>\u201cThe sense of impunity is very high. Enforcement is well below what is necessary,\u201d Silgueiro said.</p><p>In Mato Grosso state, half of whose territory is in the Amazon, the federal and state governments last year began coordinating actions to put an end to overlap that frequently left other areas unmanned and vulnerable, according to Mauren Lazzaretti, the state's environment secretary.</p><p>The state is also purchasing a helicopter and plans to deploy dozens of planes loaned by Pantanal farmers and businesses to drop fire retardant onto blazes.</p><p>Last year, over 4 million hectares (about 15,000 square miles) of the Pantanal went up in flames, or about 27% its area \u2014 by far the most since official record-keeping began in 2003. While the biome regenerates quickly, unlike rainforest, fires often kill local wildlife, such as jaguars, caimans and giant otters.</p><p>\u201cThe size of the fires last year drew society's attention to the component of individual responsibility,\u201d Lazzaretti said. \u201cThe engagement of cities, farmers and even traditional and Indigenous communities is much greater this year.\u201d</p><p>The year before, fires in the Amazon roused global concern, and several European governments openly criticized Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Bolsonaro countered that fires nationwide and in the Amazon, while up from 2018, were roughly in line with the average of the preceding several years and were down sharply from 15 years earlier. He called on European leaders to mind their own backyards.</p><p>Earlier studies showed the Amazon absorbs about 2 billion of the 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide the world emits into the atmosphere each year, making it an important part of the global effort <url normalizedValue=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapnews.com%2Farticle%2Flatin-america-ap-top-news-brazil-international-news-climate-change-384fdb5ee7654667b53ddb49efce8023&amp;data=04%7C01%7CDBiller%40ap.org%7C7c724d0e75144176a67e08d952ad8328%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C637631727482306772%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sPkIpoQYJ%2F%2BrxS5YD%2FUnw6oraz28dnk6RO9TZzBLigA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">to curb climate change</url>. But a study led by the Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, published in Nature on July 14 \u2014 spanning 10 years and involving nearly 600 flyovers \u2014 found the dry season's intensification and increased deforestation had caused more fires and higher carbon emissions. The southeastern part of the Amazon, particularly ravaged by logging, has become a net source of carbon.</p><p>Paulo Artaxo, professor of environmental physics at the University of Sao Paulo and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said other recent studies have shown even the more preserved western Amazon region is now carbon neutral in terms of emissions, while a few years ago, it was a carbon sink.</p><p>Carlos Nobre, a prominent climatologist, says Brazil\u2019s Amazon is nearing a \u201ctipping point,\" after which the thick jungle will cease to generate enough moisture to sustain its current form and will begin transforming into tropical savanna.</p><p>Nobre said Bolsonaro's government has yet to demonstrate any encouraging change in approach to help save the rainforest.</p><p>The federal government \u201ccontinues incentivizing organized crime in the Amazon that is responsible for the theft of timber, illegal deforestation and fires,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who practice these crimes haven't given any sign of worry that enforcement will become rigorous.

Democratic Hawaii Gov. Mark Green has consistently claimed that climate change was responsible for the disaster's scale, as have other Democrats, despite the apparent shortcomings in the government's response to the fires.</p><p>\u201cThe number one job of government is public safety, and they totally dropped the ball at every level,\u201d Steve Milloy, senior E&amp;E legal fellow and former Trump EPA transition team member, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cThey had actual knowledge of conditions on the ground, they understood that wildfires could be a risk, they had a duty and they did nothing\u201d to proactively mitigate the risks of a devastating fire for which they appeared to be unprepared, Milloy continued.</p><p>Green has stated repeatedly in the wake of the disaster that climate change and its effects are\u201dthe ultimate reason that so many people perished,\u201d according to the NYT. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/08/canadian-forest-fire-statistics-contradict-white-house-climate-change-narrative/\">(RELATED: Canadian Government Forest Fire Stats Contradict White House 'Climate Change' Narrative)</url></emphasis></p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p> REPORTER: \u201cMr. President, any comment on the rising death toll in Maui?\u201d<br/> BIDEN: \u201cNo. no comment.\u201d<br/> REPORTER 2: \u201cWill you come talk about the Hawaii response, Mr. President?\u201d<br/> Crickets... <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/RdftKKcmPt\">pic.twitter.com/RdftKKcmPt</url><br/> - Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1691094299797241856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 14, 2023</url><br/></p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>Emergency alert sirens in the hard-hit town of Lahania never sounded, the town's 911 emergency service went offline and firefighters battling the blaze reportedly ran out of water, according to the NYT. As a result, many residents trying to flee the blazes were left to burn alive in their vehicles.</p><p>In addition to the failures of infrastructure, experts have said that vast areas of unmanaged land on the island featured dense concentrations of non-native grasses that made large swaths of land akin to tinderboxes, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/13/us/hawaii-wildfire-factors.html#:~:text=The%20document%20listed%20West%20Maui,to%20less%20than%2090%20percent.\">according</url> to the NYT. The possibility of a large-scale wildfire was not unknown to the state of Hawaii, as the government assessed in 2020 that West Maui, where Lahania is located, has a 90% chance of wildfires each year on average.</p><p>Other Democrats have rushed to blame climate change for being the primary cause of the tragedy. Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said Sunday that \u201cwe very much need to acknowledge that climate change is upon us\u201d and that \u201cwe need to be assessing our ability to contend with this kind of naturally-occurring disasters\u201d during an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/08/13/sotu-hirono-climate-change.cnn\">appearance</url> on CNN, in which she also blamed strong winds from Hurricane Dora as a contributing factor for the scale of the blazes.</p><p>However, the winds that fanned the flames that devoured Lahania were natural trade winds, and not from Hurricane Dora, which passed hundreds of miles to the south of the Hawaiian islands, <url normalizedValue=\"https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2023/08/the-origin-of-hawaii-firespreventing.html\">according</url> to analysis conducted by Cliff Mass, a meteorologist and professor for the University of Washington's Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Advocates for sweeping government action on climate change often <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/05/09/alarmists-claim-global-warming-fueled-hurricane-harvey/\">cite</url> intensified and more frequent hurricanes as a result of human-caused climate change.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1689691987916603394?s=20\">tweeted</url> that \u201cthis is a climate emergency\u201d in response to a video of the smoldering island Thursday. Democratic Rep.

Jeff Merkley <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1689366387041439745?s=20\">tweeted</url> last week. \u201cWe need to take action immediately or else it will get even worse.\u201d</p><p>In July, wildfires ripped through Rhodes, a Greek island popular with tourists comparable to Maui in terms of its size and population, catching bystanders largely by surprise.

With extremely dry weather hitting several Mediterranean nations, European Commissioner for Interinstitutional Relations and Foresight Maros Sefcovic told legislators yesterday that \"the present drought in Europe could become the worst ever.\" </p><p>Fires ravaging huge swaths of countryside only exacerbate the climate crisis, he said. \"Statistics show that since 2017, we have the most intense, intense forest fires ever seen in Europe - and that we unfortunately expect the 2022 forest fire season could follow this trend,\" he said. Extended drought conditions have hit several member states like Greece and Italy, and a heat wave last month went as far up as northern Germany. It heightened concerns across Europe for more disasters for the rest of the summer. Sefcovic said the European Union is already funding the deployment of over 200 firefighters from across the bloc to deal with fires in Greece. Italy is in the midst of an early summer heat wave, coupled with the worst drought in northern Italy in 70 years, and the conditions were linked to the disaster last Sunday when a huge chunk of the Marmolada glacier cleaved off and crashed onto hikers. The death toll stands at nine, with five people who had been hiking there still unaccounted for. \"The tragic event in Marmolada is just the latest example of disasters linked to warmer temperatures and thus to climate change,\" Sefcovic said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-00000181d9cadc8ea5d9dbdf734f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6639-2J51-F0YC-P1N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"273\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 8, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'I've got to say this: Shame on Republicans \u2014 shame on Democrats in Congress for what they did last week' when 'they passed that $2 trillion spending bill.' Moore specifically held the GOP's feet to the fire: 'Your job in 2023 is to cut government spending as much as you possibly can. It's a cancer cell.' <br/>Moore noted that '[t]he reason we saw this massive inflation under [President Joe] Biden was that he spent $4.1 trillion over the amount we would normally spend and of course that caused this forest fire of higher inflation.' Apparently Congress didn't get the message. Moore added that '[w]hat happened at the end of 2022 with Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell making this horrific deal. It doesn't bode well for 2023 in terms of getting our finances straight and getting anywhere near a balanced budget.' <br/>The New York Post Editorial Board wrote Dec. 26[3] that 'laughable pieces of pork' riddled the ominous omnibus package. Examples of 'pork' included 'self-named monuments for various legislators' and a 'chauffeur for the IRS commissioner,' none of which will do a thing[4] to bring inflation under control. <br/>The Post similarly pointed out that Biden presided over a national debt explosion from 'from around $28 trillion to $31.43 trillion.' The deficit is 'is also growing by leaps and bounds,' the Post reported. It was $1.4 trillion at the end of 2022, 'the fourth highest on record.' In effect, this would mean 'massive tax hikes for future generations or colossal service cuts at the most basic level of government. Somebody has to pay for all this.' Apparently, Congress' actions suggest that it isn't really concerned about whose 'pay[ing] for all this.' Rather, the purse-controlling behemoth seems to be obsessed with just sinking the American economy further into the cesspool of debt and high inflation[5] with impunity. <br/>Conservatives are under attack. Contact ABC News (818) 460-7477, CBS News (212) 975-3247 and NBC News (212) 664-6192 and demand they report on the devastating effects Congress' reckless spending will have on the inflation-rattled economy. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://committeetounleashprosperity.com/our-founders\">https://committeetounleashprosperity.com/our-founders</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mrctv.org/videos/steve-moore-blasts-congress-insane-17t-omnibus-spending-bill\">https://www.mrctv.org/videos/steve-moore-blasts-congress-insane-17t-omnibus-spending-bill</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/whats-another-1-7t-in-the-omnibus-when-youve-taken-the-national-debt-to-31-4t/\">https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/whats-another-1-7t-in-the-omnibus-when-youve-taken-the-national-debt-to-31-4t/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.johnlocke.org/more-taxes-more-inflation-congress-voting-on-massive-1-7-trillion-omnibus-bill\">https://www.johnlocke.org/more-taxes-more-inflation-congress-voting-on-massive-1-7-trillion-omnibus-bill</url>/ [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.yahoo.com/70-americans-believes-economic-conditions-172145008.html\">https://news.yahoo.com/70-americans-believes-economic-conditions-172145008.html</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2023/01/03/watch-economist-steve-moore-blasts-congress-ramming\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NBST107778167276226898425876100146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NBST-6588</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677G-FK21-JCMN-Y15V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484270</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><timeReceived>4:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Newsbusters.org</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 3, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000107</classCode><className>APPROPRIATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

These efforts culminated in a pay raise of 50% or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2022/06/biden-team-announces-pay-raises-20000-annually-federal-firefighters/368401/\">$20,000 per year</url>, whichever was lower, enacted via the bipartisan infrastructure law and implemented last year.</p><p>But the funding for the pay raise was only temporary, and is set to run out at the end of the current fiscal year, or Sept. 30. Absent additional action by Congress and the White House, beginning in October those firefighters would see their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2022/06/biden-team-announces-pay-raises-20000-annually-federal-firefighters/368401/\">wages plummet</url>. Advocates and federal employee unions have warned that if the federal wildfire suppression workforce goes over the \u201cpay cliff,\u201d it would trigger a mass exodus of firefighters from federal agencies.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee advanced the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sinema.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/EHF23659_0.pdf\">S. 2272</url>), introduced last week by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and a bipartisan group of five other senators, to the floor for consideration by the full Senate. The bill makes the 2022 pay raises permanent by creating a special pay rate for federal firefighters and provides a new pay supplement to compensate firefighters for every day that they are deployed to combat a wildfire.</p><p>The legislation also instructs agencies to develop a consistent governmentwide policy related to wildland firefighter work-life balance and to study new opportunities to improve rest and recuperation time for firefighters to help combat burnout.</p><p>\u201cWe proposed and passed fair pay for wildland firefighters in the bipartisan infrastructure law, and now we need to make it permanent,\u201d Sinema said Wednesday. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, they will lose up to 50% of their salary or 20,000. This bill makes fair pay for firefighters permanent in a fiscally responsible manner. If we don\u2019t act by the end of this fiscal year, we will see massive departures from the workforce, right at the peak of wildfire season.\u201d</p><p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., the committee\u2019s ranking member, was the lone vote opposed to the measure. He bemoaned the fact that the Congressional Budget Office had not yet analyzed the bill, despite the fact that CBO only scores legislation after it has been advanced out of committee, and sought to amend the legislation so that it would sunset after two years.</p><p>\u201cThis would be somewhat equivalent to being in a board meeting for a hospital and saying, \u2018Gosh, the EMTs save lives and people would die without them, and we have 50 of them and they just aren\u2019t paid enough, but nobody would say, \u2018Well, what is our budget for labor?\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019d have a debate on the facts\u2014whether it\u2019s an appropriate amount, how it compares to other employers, and we\u2019d also ask how much money we have\u2014which gets back to the question that has been underlying this entire debate: should we have to make choices? Who can be against increasing firefighters\u2019 salaries? It\u2019s that kind of empty, vacant sort of thinking that\u2019s caused us to be $30 trillion in debt.\u201d</p><p>Sinema responded by citing the multitude of congressional hearings, including one as recently as last month, and Government Accountability Office reports devoted to wildland firefighter compensation and the pay gap between federal firefighters and their state and local counterparts. Paul\u2019s amendment ultimately failed by an 11-4 vote.</p><p>And on Tuesday, the Office of Personnel Management provided an update on its efforts to implement another provision of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2021/11/biden-signs-wildland-firefighter-pay-reform-law-part-infrastructure-package/186908/\">bipartisan infrastructure law</url>: creating a new occupational series for wildland firefighters. Prior to that bill\u2019s passage, federal firefighters were classified in a more general \u201cforestry technician\u201d job category, meaning entry level hires often started at a GS-3 salary.</p><p>In a memo to agency human resources directors, Karen Jacobs, OPM\u2019s acting deputy associate director for talent acquisition, classification and veterans programs unveiled draft qualifications standards for the new wildland fire management job series, following consultation with experts both on wildland firefighting and HR issues.</p><p>\u201cBoth technical agency fire management and human resources subject matter experts provided key insights into the duties and skills needed to perform wildland firefighting work,\u201d she wrote.</p><p>Although the draft standards do not move wildland firefighting jobs up the General Schedule pay scale, with entry level positions still beginning at a GS-3, it does remove many of the barriers to firefighters serving at higher levels of the pay scale.</p><p>Under the draft standards, a GS-3 requires only six months of general \u201cwork experience or military service\u201d and skills related to following instructions. A GS-4 or above would also require six months of specialized work experience related to controlling or extinguishing fires, forest fire control, prevention and suppression, rescue operations and other skills related to firefighting. That experience could be obtained on the job as a GS-3. And firefighters can serve at a GS-5 or above with at least one year of experience at a position at the next lower pay grade.</p><p>Alternately, a GS-3 could be hired provided they received firefighter training as part of their high school curriculum, and GS-4s may be hired upon completion of a two-year college program in fire training, fire science or other related fields. Applicants can be hired at a GS-5 without relevant job experience only if they have completed a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree in fire related studies.</p><p>The qualification standards also include a litany of requirements related to applicants\u2019 physical and mental health.</p><p>\u201cAs this is a new occupation, the draft shall be implemented upon issuance and used to qualify candidates for positions in this series,\u201d Jacobs wrote. \u201cPlease review the application of this draft qualification standard for impact, clarity and easy of use over the next 30 days. We rely on agency human resources officials to ensure subject matter experts and program management officials are aware of the release of this draft standard and to seek their input.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVEXT-388698</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOVEXT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68SG-R291-F0YC-S0GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">485428</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1074\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Government Media Executive Group LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Government Executive</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

We have a number of them here with us today.</p><p>\"I also do have some significant concerns.</p><p>\"In the last two years, Congress has provided over 10 billion additional dollars to the Forest Service.</p><p>\"The budget proposes massive increases in new spending.</p><p>\"Your request for $7.4 billion in discretionary appropriations would amount to a 52 percent increase over current funding levels.</p><p>\"In an era of historic budget deficits, the Forest Service really needs to prioritize.</p><p>\"To be clear, the Forest Service faces enormous challenges in the fight against wildfires.</p><p>\"One-third of our National Forests are at serious risk to being consumed by catastrophic fires.</p><p>\"There is broad agreement among members of this committee - both sides of the aisle - that the historic forest fire treatment levels are totally inadequate to meet the challenge.</p><p>\"While I support robust funding for the efforts, I'm not convinced that we can simply just spend our way out of problems that have plagued our forests for decades.</p><p>\"The Forest Service needs to fully embrace efforts to streamline its processes for approving projects that improve forest health.</p><p>\"The agency needs to more aggressively defend against harmful litigation that prevents projects from moving forward.</p><p>\"Far too often, when extreme environmental groups sue, vital wildfire reduction projects get tied up in the court and don't get accomplished.</p><p>\"I'm also deeply troubled by what appears to be the intentional exclusion of Wyoming from major Forest Service initiatives aimed at reducing wildfire risk.</p><p>\"In its 10-year strategy to combat the wildfire crisis, the agency has announced significant spending across 21 designated areas.</p><p>\"These dollars fund projects that are critical for reducing wildfire risk, and defending America's forests.</p><p>\"They're going to protect people's lives and livelihoods.</p><p>\"Inexplicably, Wyoming is the only state located on or west of the Rocky Mountains that has not received funding under this strategy - the only state of all of those.</p><p>\"Further, Wyoming is the only western state to be excluded from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission.</p><p>\"This is a commission created by Congress to help improve strategies to prevent, to manage, to suppress, and to recover from wildfires.</p><p>\"That's why in March of last year, I, along with the rest of the Wyoming delegation, sent a letter specifically requesting that Wyoming be represented on the Commission.</p><p>\"Here we are, a year later, Wyoming is still not represented.</p><p>\"This is a pattern of neglect that simply must change.</p><p>\"Much like other western states, Wyoming is highly vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service estimates, more than four million acres of Wyoming's forests are at either high or very high risk to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>\"And we've seen the tragic results of the failure to properly manage these acres.</p><p>\"In four of the past five years, Wyoming has been hit by numerous destructive fires.</p><p>\"In 2020 alone, we experienced nearly 340 thousand burned acres.... We're talking about a large area of land.</p><p>\"Today, our communities remain in harm's way.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service's website WildfireRisk.org, towns in Wyoming, like Dubois, Jackson, Buffalo, Lander, and Saratoga are all at high risk to destructive wildfires.</p><p>\"I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better protection.</p><p>\"And, at the very least, they deserve the same protections that every other western state is getting.</p><p>\"Thanks so much, Madame Chairman, and I look forward to the questions and hearing today.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/4/barrasso-the-people-of-wyoming-deserve-better-wildfire-protection\">https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/4/barrasso-the-people-of-wyoming-deserve-better-wildfire-protection</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSP418308A4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6828-2B81-JCCP-004W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 18, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dozens of wildfires[1] are ablaze across the country, including at least four other major ones. <br/>Camille Delay fled her home town of Hostens on the orders of emergency services late on Tuesday with her partner and son as a wall of flames drew rapidly closer. <br/>The couple grabbed their two cats, chickens and house insurance documents before taking flight, she said. <br/>'Everyone in the village climbed onto their rooftops to see what was happening - within 10 minutes a little twist of smoke became enormous,' the 30-year-old told Reuters news agency by telephone. <br/>France is struggling with successive heatwaves and its worst drought on record [SDIS 33 Service Audiovisuel via AP] <br/>The local Gironde authority described the blaze as 'rampant'. Firefighters said more evacuations were likely. <br/>The Gironde was hit by major wildfires in July which destroyed more than 20,000 hectares (49,421 acres) of forest and temporarily forced nearly 40,000 people from their homes. <br/>Authorities believe the latest inferno was a result of the previous fires still smouldering in the area's peaty soil. <br/>Fires were also raging in the southern departments of Lozere and Aveyron. In the Maine-et-Loire department in western France, more than 1,200 hectares (2,965 acres) have been scorched by another fire. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ALJZ136341166013525295125976100044</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALJZ-136341</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664B-KN41-JCMN-Y0K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><timeReceived>12:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Al Jazeera English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 10, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>France</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Susan Collins participated in an event at the Whiting Town Office yesterday to celebrate a $2.9 million grant to restore a fish passage for the Mill Pond Dam. Senator Collins, the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, secured the funding in the government appropriations bill that was signed into law last month. The project will preserve the pond and will take a key step to help restore critical habitat for the endangered Atlantic salmon throughout the Orange River Watershed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Mill Pond Dam is located at the site of a former mill that was initially constructed in the early 1800s and equipped with a wooden fish ladder system. A fire destroyed the mill and fish ladder in the 1950s, and the dam subsequently fell into a state of disrepair.</p><p>\"For generations, Mill Pond has served as a focal point for the Town of Whiting. In addition to its scenic beauty, Mill Pond is a crucial water source for firefighters, which proved instrumental in saving the town from the destructive Bell Mountain forest fire in 1985,\" said Senator Collins. \"The funding for this project will protect the pond while restoring critical habitat for native fish populations, benefitting current and future generations of anglers.\"</p><p>Following the event at the town office, Senator Collins stopped by Whiting Village School. Principal Scott Johnson and nine students were among the dozens of local residents who wrote letters in support of the Mill Pond Dam project.</p><p>One young student wrote, \"Without the Mill Pond, my house would have had a lot more damage done to it when we had our fire, since they would've had to go to the nearest water supply other than the pond.\"</p><p>Another resident wrote, \"My Dad...was in a battle for his life in the Battle of the Bulge. When boxes of ammunition appeared on the battlefield stamped CRANE'S MILL ~ WHITING, MAINE, he proudly said to his men, 'This is my hometown. THIS is what we are fighting for!' How do you put a value on that? I think of the history of that millpond and dam each time I drive down Route One.\"</p><p>\"Many of you wrote letters supporting this exciting project,\" Senator Collins told those who gathered at the school. \"When I discussed this funding with my Senate colleagues, your letters really made a difference.\"</p><p>The Mill Pond Dam project will establish a fish passage at the first dam on the Orange River while maintaining critical water levels for regional firefighting efforts. The Orange River is a coastal river system with a watershed of approximately 32 square miles. The watershed includes approximately 12 miles of river channel and nearly 2,000 acres of lakes and ponds. The river has been designated as Critical Habitat for Atlantic Salmon, and records confirm the system historically supported river herring and other diadromous fish species.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Senator Collins successfully sponsored more than 285 projects in Maine totaling more than $500 million in FY22 and FY23 by state government, municipalities, colleges and universities, and non-profits. These projects will promote job creation, workforce training, and economic development; expand access to health care; improve public safety, infrastructure, and community resources; and protect our environment.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-whiting-to-celebrate-29-million-for-mill-pond-dam\">https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-whiting-to-celebrate-29-million-for-mill-pond-dam</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8049569 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8049569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CX-0BM1-JC11-14T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><timeReceived>10:47 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 21, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Glad to have you here today.</p><p>\"We are looking forward to hearing how the proposed budget intends to further the critical mission of the agency.</p><p>\"I'm pleased with some of your priorities within the budget request.</p><p>\"For example, there is funding to protect our forests from catastrophic fire, as the chairman just said, providing badly-needed pay increases to our brave firefighters. We have a number of them here with us today.</p><p>\"I also do have some significant concerns.</p><p>\"In the last two years, Congress has provided over 10 billion additional dollars to the Forest Service.</p><p>\"The budget proposes massive increases in new spending.</p><p>\"Your request for $7.4 billion in discretionary appropriations would amount to a 52 percent increase over current funding levels.</p><p>\"In an era of historic budget deficits, the Forest Service really needs to prioritize.</p><p>?</p><p>\"To be clear, the Forest Service faces enormous challenges in the fight against wildfires.</p><p>\"One-third of our National Forests are at serious risk to being consumed by catastrophic fires.</p><p>\"There is broad agreement among members of this committee - both sides of the aisle - that the historic forest fire treatment levels are totally inadequate to meet the challenge.</p><p>\"While I support robust funding for the efforts, I'm not convinced that we can simply just spend our way out of problems that have plagued our forests for decades.</p><p>\"The Forest Service needs to fully embrace efforts to streamline its processes for approving projects that improve forest health.</p><p>\"The agency needs to more aggressively defend against harmful litigation that prevents projects from moving forward.</p><p>\"Far too often, when extreme environmental groups sue, vital wildfire reduction projects get tied up in the court and don't get accomplished.</p><p>\"I'm also deeply troubled by what appears to be the intentional exclusion of Wyoming from major Forest Service initiatives aimed at reducing wildfire risk.</p><p>\"In its 10-year strategy to combat the wildfire crisis, the agency has announced significant spending across 21 designated areas.</p><p>\"These dollars fund projects that are critical for reducing wildfire risk, and defending America's forests.</p><p>\"They're going to protect people's lives and livelihoods.</p><p>\"Inexplicably, Wyoming is the only state located on or west of the Rocky Mountains that has not received funding under this strategy - the only state of all of those.</p><p>\"Further, Wyoming is the only western state to be excluded from the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission.</p><p>\"This is a commission created by Congress to help improve strategies to prevent, to manage, to suppress, and to recover from wildfires.</p><p>\"That's why in March of last year, I, along with the rest of the Wyoming delegation, sent a letter specifically requesting that Wyoming be represented on the Commission.</p><p>\"Here we are, a year later, Wyoming is still not represented.</p><p>\"This is a pattern of neglect that simply must change.</p><p>\"Much like other western states, Wyoming is highly vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service estimates, more than four million acres of Wyoming's forests are at either high or very high risk to catastrophic wildfires.</p><p>\"And we've seen the tragic results of the failure to properly manage these acres.</p><p>\"In four of the past five years, Wyoming has been hit by numerous destructive fires.</p><p>\"In 2020 alone, we experienced nearly 340 thousand burned acres.... We're talking about a large area of land.</p><p>\"Today, our communities remain in harm's way.</p><p>\"According to the Forest Service's website WildfireRisk.org, towns in Wyoming, like Dubois, Jackson, Buffalo, Lander, and Saratoga are all at high risk to destructive wildfires.</p><p>\"I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better protection.</p><p>\"And, at the very least, they deserve the same protections that every other western state is getting.</p><p>\"Thanks so much, Madame Chairman, and I look forward to the questions and hearing today.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COS1K404182023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6829-6HD1-JCCP-02YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 18, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It emphasizes the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems, which rely on regular fire exposure to stay healthy.<br/>In other words, the Forest Service aims to fight fire with fire.<br/>As part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, the Forest Service will receive $5 billion over 10 years, including $1.8 billion that will be used to increase forest treatments in 11 new landscapes across Western states. Those treatments include prescribed burns.<br/>Preventing catastrophic wildfires<br/>Prescribed burns are a wildfire prevention method that involves burning an area of land in a controlled manner in order to minimize the risk of future catastrophic wildfires.<br/>\u201cThe objective of many of these prescribed fires is to reduce forest fuels in the area,\u201d said Zach Boness, burn boss for the prescribed burns in Kaibab National Forest. \u201cWe live in a fire-dependent ecosystem in northern Arizona, and so fire is part of how these trees remain healthy, how the forest remains healthy. \u201d<br/>\u201cForest fuels\u201d refer to anything in the forest that can burn, including dead plants, dead trees, built-up leaves and pine needles. If these materials aren\u2019t burned away in a controlled manner they can build up and become fuel for dangerous wildfires, causing them to spread quickly and burn longer, making it difficult for fire crews to contain a wildfire once it starts.<br/>In areas like the Kaibab forest, wildfires are often started by lightning strikes. When there is a lot of fuel on the forest floor, the fires can spread quickly.<br/>Areas that have been pre-burned, though, don\u2019t burn as intensely and often won\u2019t burn at all since the forest fuels have already been burned off, according to Bob Blasi, a Kaibab National Forest fire information officer.<br/>\u201cA raging fire headed straight towards a pre-treated area will usually just go and drop,\u201d Blasi said. \u201cWildfires can stop dead in their tracks, literally, when they hit a pre-treated piece of ground like this. \u201d<br/>According to Blasi, once a piece of land has burned, it likely won\u2019t burn again for another 10 to 15 years.<br/>\u201cWe do have empirical evidence that speaks to the effectiveness of these prescribed fires and other fuels treatments in slowing down and allowing us to be more successful when fire suppression is required,\u201d Boness said.<br/>Environmental benefits<br/>The ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona rely on regular fire exposure to encourage biodiversity.<br/>\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have fires frequently, then the forests get very dense,\u201d said Andrea Thode, a professor of fire ecology and fire science in the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. \u201cThe trees are very close together; they don\u2019t grow in diameter and they don\u2019t get a lot bigger. \u201d<br/>When there is an excess amount of trees, the amount of forest fuels on the ground increases, making it difficult for native plant species to flourish. Additionally, when the canopy of trees is thicker, less sunlight can reach the ground to encourage photosynthesis.<br/>Where plants struggle to grow, wildlife struggles to live. Species such as elk rely on the forbs, grasses and shrubs that grow in the ponderosa pine forests, but when forests are dense, they aren\u2019t able to access their food supply.<br/>Prescribed burns help manage forest density and burn off the build-up of fuels on the ground, allowing for more plants to grow.<br/>Additionally, when a prescribed fire burns through an area and blackens the trunks of trees, it leaves behind ash rich in minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen, Thode said. These minerals then soak into the soil on the ground and boost the plant growth.<br/>Prescribed burns help ensure that these minerals can soak into the ground.<br/>\u201cAt certain temperatures, nitrogen will volatilize, so it goes from that solid state to a gaseous state and is lost to the system,\u201d Thode said, \u201cbut with low-severity fires, it\u2019s released and so you do get an ash that has a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus in it. \u201d<br/>Thode said that even species that tend to prefer living in denser forest ecosystems benefit from prescribed burns. Mexican spotted owls, a threatened species that resides in northern Arizona forests, roosts in dense groups of trees but they require more open areas when hunting for food.<br/>\u201cRemoving the more continuous fuels, making (forests) more heterogeneous landscapes, changes the way that fire can move through that landscape to protect those areas, even if they do need to be more dense where the owls are nesting,\u201d Thode said.<br/>Prescribed burns do produce smoke, which releases carbon into the atmosphere, but according to Thode, it\u2019s much less intense and harmful than the smoke from a catastrophic wildfire.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s not really if it\u2019s going to burn,\u201d Thode said. \u201cIt\u2019s when it\u2019s going to burn and how it\u2019s going to burn. \u201d<br/>The process of prescribed burns<br/>These burns are planned months ahead of time. Early aspects of planning include organizing crews, planning burn locations, developing prescriptions, organizing permits and informing the public.<br/>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it than just a bunch of cavemen dragging drip torches around,\u201d Blasi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very detailed organization, and it requires a lot of experience level from the top all the way to the bottom. \u201d<br/>Specialists also develop a burn plan, or \u201cprescription. \u201d This prescription takes into account weather, environmental risks and location to determine the best conditions for a burn.<br/>Then, crews head to the location to begin preparing. They prepare bulldozer lines, which are clear areas that act as barriers for a particular burn, and they clear out some of the harder-to-remove excess fuels with saws so that the burns are easier to control.<br/>While plans are determined ahead of time, they are often subject to change due to the unpredictability of factors like weather and humidity.<br/>\u201cWe\u2019re prepping right up until the day of, making sure we have the resources that are needed and getting folks in place for all that,\u201d Boness said.<br/>On the day of, crews begin by gathering at a morning briefing led by burn bosses. Boness was the burn boss in charge of the prescribed burns in the Kaibab National Forest, aided by burn boss trainee Ryan Allen.<br/>\u201cWe\u2019re ultimately the ones in charge of the operations out here on our prescribed fire,\u201d Boness said. \u201cWe coordinate with both our firing group and our holding group as well as coordinating between the agency administrator and our other overhead personnel to make sure we\u2019re answering questions and that all the permits are in place, that all of our bases are covered so that we\u2019re following our policy. \u201d<br/>At the briefing on Oct. 5, Boness and Allen went over the plans for the day\u2019s burn to make sure everyone from each crew was on the same page and knew where they were assigned.<br/>After the briefing comes the test fire, where the burn bosses observe a small, controlled fire to ensure that the forest conditions will allow for it to burn the way they want it to.<br/>\u201cIf that\u2019s successful for us, if we see that we\u2019re meeting our conditions, meeting our prescribed fire window, then we\u2019ll continue with our general ignitions,\u201d Boness said.<br/>Following a successful test fire, the fire crews get to work. Ground crews first \u201cblackline\u201d the area set to burn, using drip torches to ignite thin lines of fire on the outer edges to act as a barrier preventing fires from spreading outside the prescribed area.<br/>Then a helicopter equipped with a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) drops small fireballs, no larger than a pingpong ball, inside the perimeter to burn the area quickly and efficiently while putting fewer workers at risk.<br/>As the PSD operator for the prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, Christian Cortes was in charge of releasing four to five fireballs per acre. Inside the PSD machine, the balls are injected with ethylene glycol, which causes them to ignite once they hit the ground.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s like an art; there\u2019s a certain way to do it to avoid balls from flying all over the place or losing control of anything,\u201d Cortes said.<br/>Throughout the prescribed burn process, safety is a priority, Blasi said. As firing crews lay down blacklines and the helicopter drops fireballs, holding crews drive trucks around the edges of burn areas to make sure that fire isn\u2019t jumping from already burned \u201cblack\u201d areas into unburned \u201cgreen\u201d areas. If they see a spot where the fire has jumped across the line, they put it out. Fires are continuously monitored as they burn through the night.<br/>Additionally, each burn is assigned an air resource adviser and meteorologist. The adviser from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality monitors the smoke to determine health risks while the meteorologist helps ensure that the burns are safe to complete under current weather conditions.<br/>Sometimes areas are completely blocked off during prescribed burns for the safety of the public. The prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, though, were deemed safe enough to allow people to drive next to where the fires were burning.<br/>\u201cWe use it mostly for an opportunity to educate people,\u201d Blasi said. \u201cWe want them to come up close to see it, we want them to understand why it\u2019s important. \u201d<br/>Lindsay Nava, a recent graduate from NAU, said that the Forest Service\u2019s work with prescribed burns is part of what inspired her to get involved in fire control. She has worked as a crewmember on various prescribed burn projects for the past year.<br/>\u201cPeople don\u2019t go out and do this because they don\u2019t care, you know?\u201d Nava said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I love this job is because there are so many passionate people who really care about our public lands and our natural resources and it\u2019s really great to be surrounded by that. \u201d<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2023 BridgeTower Media.

Every time there is a fire or smoke appears in the sky, some politicians blame climate change, using it to justify expensive new policies.<br/>But what is really causing the increase in forest fires and smoke in the air. Here is a quick primer on what is contributing to the trend we see across the West and what will (and won't) work to address the problem.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is climate change causing the increase in forest fires?</emphasis><br/>As smoke from forest fires has become an annual tradition in Washington state, some politicians have been quick to seize on it to push their climate policies. Governor Inslee has taken to calling the forest fires, \"climate fires.\" As politically convenient as that is, the science says it is wrong.<br/>A study from researchers at the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Montana found that only 14% of catastrophic wildfire across the West can be attributed to temperature increases from climate change. When looking at \"the drivers of high-severity fire for forested ecoregions in the western US,\" they found that climate was a small factor in the increase in catastrophic wildlife during that time.<br/>Climate change is not what is causing our smoky summers and increasing the number catastrophic wildfires.<br/>    Sign up for the WPC Newsletter      Please enter full name        Please enter e-mail address            <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If it isn't climate change, what is causing the increase in forest fires?</emphasis><br/>The simple answer is that unhealthy forests are driving catastrophic wildfire. As the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) notes, \"We have a forest health crisis in our state. And because of our forest health crisis, we are seeing more catastrophic wildfires.\"<br/>The Forest Service study backs this up. The researchers noted that \"live fuel, on average, was the most important factor driving high-severity fire,\" accounting for more than half of the catastrophic fires across the West.<br/>Dense, unhealthy forests - with too many trees competing for too little water, light, nutrients - are more fire prone. One story on the risk of unhealthy forests correctly notes that \"In a traditional ponderosa-pine forest, fire meanders along the ground. In a crowded forest, fire jumps to the tops of trees and spreads with the wind, faster than firefighters can control it.\"<br/>Trees that are stressed from lack of nutrients also have a difficult time fighting off pest infestations. Bugs can kill large swaths of forest, leaving them as tinder for the next lightning strike. In the severe 2020 fire season, the fuel in one fire was described as, \"large expanses of beetle kill timber, 80-90 percent of the stand.\" In that condition, forests are at serious risk with or without temperature increases.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What can we do to fix the situation?</emphasis><br/>We need to return forests to a more natural state using a combination of harvesting, thinning, and controlled burns.<br/>Earlier this year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack released a 10-year strategy to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire, highlighting the \"need to significantly increase fuels and forest health treatments to address the escalating crisis of wildfire danger that threatens millions of acres and numerous communities across the United States.\"<br/>This is also the approach being taken by the Colville Confederated Tribes to improve the health of their forests. We worked with them to produce a video on their forest management and how they are reducing the risk of catastrophic fire with harvests and thinning.<br/>Returning our forests to a more natural, healthy state is challenging. As I wrote in the Seattle Times earlier this year, \"Meaningful progress in treating unhealthy, fire-prone forests has been difficult because harvesting and thinning often costs more than it yields, even when some timber revenue is generated. Without a source of funding, there will be very little progress toward reducing the risk of recurring catastrophic wildfire we've witnessed in recent years. The cost of meeting the goals of the Washington state Department of Natural Resources' 20-year Forest Health Strategic Plan is likely to be hundreds of millions, or billions, of dollars over the course of the plan.\"<br/>There are many ways to find this revenue, including a proposal from Rep. Mary Dye called the ORCA plan, and a program called \"Good Neighbor Authority\" which allows DNR to harvest unhealthy federal forests and use the revenue to fund ongoing treatments.<br/>The bottom line is that it took a long time to get our forests into this situation and it will take time to repair their health.<br/>Fixating on climate policy, however, distracts from the real driver of catastrophic wildfire and makes it difficult to find the resources to address the problem.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will climate policy reduce catastrophic wildfire?</emphasis><br/>No. Even if Washington state and the whole world meet the most aggressive targets of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees C (compared to pre-industrial levels), temperatures will still be higher in the year 2100 compared to today. Achieving those targets is not only extremely expensive (and extremely unlikely), it would not reduce the risk of smoky summers any time soon.<br/>University of Washington research backs this up. University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor David Battisti noted that \"even with strong reductions in fossil fuel use, over the next 30 years\" temperature increases would increase the risk of catastrophic fire.<br/>Using catastrophic fire to justify climate policy is about political messaging, and is not a strategy that will reduce the habitat and health risks from those fires.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-170037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66JN-4J11-JCG7-83W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 Washington Policy, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Policy Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 6, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>BLOG</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

According to news reporting out of the Instituto Politecnico de Tomar by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires, though part of a natural forest renewal process, when frequent and on a large -scale, have detrimental impacts on biodiversity, agroforestry systems, soil erosion, air, and water quality, infrastructures, and the economy. Portugal endures extreme forest fires, with a record extent of burned areas in 2017.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Funds By Fct-the Portuguese Foundation For Science And Technology. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Instituto Politecnico de Tomar: \"These complexes of extreme wildfire events (CEWEs) concentrated in a few days but with highly burned areas are, among other factors, linked to severe fire weather conditions. In this study, a comparison between several fire danger indices (named \u2018multi-indices diagnosis') is performed for the control period 2001-2021, 2007 and 2017 (May-October) for the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Burning Index (BI), Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), Continuous Haines Index (CHI), and the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). Daily analysis for the so-called Pedrogao Grande wildfire (17 June) and the October major fires (15 October) included the Spread Component (SC), Ignition Component (IC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index (BUI), and the Energy Release Component (ERC). Results revealed statistically significant high above-average values for most of the indices for 2017 in comparison with 2001-2021, particularly for October. The spatial distribution of BI, IC, ERC, and SC had the best performance in capturing the locations of the two CEWEs that were driven by atmospheric instability along with a dry environment aloft. These results were confirmed by the hotspot analysis that showed statistically significant intense spatial clustering between these indices and the burned areas. The spatial patterns for SC and ISI showed high values associated with high velocities in the spread of these fires.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The outcomes allowed us to conclude that since fire danger depends on several factors, a multi-indices diagnosis can be highly relevant. The implementation of a Multi-index Prediction Methodology should be able to further enhance the ability to track and forecast unique CEWEs since the shortcomings of some indices are compensated by the information retrieved by others, as shown in this study. Overall, a new forecast method can help ensure the development of appropriate spatial preparedness plans, proactive responses by civil protection regarding firefighter management, and suppression efforts to minimize the detrimental impacts of wildfires in Portugal.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Multi-Indices Diagnosis of the Conditions That Led to the Two 2017 Major Wildfires in Portugal.

The revamped agreement seeks to further common goals in the areas of environmental and biodiversity protection, sustainable resource management, forest protection, agrifood security, and emergency planning and management.</p><p>The partnership comes after the former Italian State Forestry Corps was incorporated into the Carabinieri Corps in 2017, giving the latter responsibility for the protection of Italy's forests and ecological resources, along with the responsibility for combating illicit activities related to the agrifood sector.</p><p>The MoU was signed by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu and the Commanding General of the Carabinieri, Lt. General Teo Luzi, at an event held at FAO's headquarters in Rome.</p><p>The FAO Director-General noted that the renewal of the agreement was taking place on a \"special day\" as it coincided with the 8th World Forestry Week (WFW2022) hosted by FAO, in the context of the 26th Session of the FAO Committee on Forestry (COFO26) taking place this week. He also reaffirmed FAO's commitment to working closely with the Italian Government and further strengthening collaboration, including with the Carabinieri Corps.</p><p>In his address, Lt. Gen. Luzi remarked that the understanding seals the willingness to effectively and solidly pool resources, experience and knowledge in direct support of FAO's universal goals.</p><p>As part of the partnership the Carabinieri has been able to develop 14 Safe and Secure Approach to Field Environment (SSAFE) courses, which provide training specifically aimed at FAO personnel deployed in crisis areas.</p><p>The renewal of the Memorandum also includes cooperation activities in the areas of forest fire prevention, protection of wildlife species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), forest engineering, and land care.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-and-italy's-carabinieri-renew-collaboration-for-the-protection-of-the-environment-forests-and-biodiversity/en\">https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-and-italy's-carabinieri-renew-collaboration-for-the-protection-of-the-environment-forests-and-biodiversity/en</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7962355 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7962355</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66JG-3Y91-JC11-11DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 5, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Susan M. Collins (R-ME) News Release</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whiting, ME--U.S. Senator Susan Collins participated in an event at the Whiting Town Office yesterday to celebrate a $2.9 million grant to restore a fish passage for the Mill Pond Dam. Senator Collins, the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, secured the funding in the government appropriations bill that was signed into law last month. The project will preserve the pond and will take a key step to help restore critical habitat for the endangered Atlantic salmon throughout the Orange River Watershed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Mill Pond Dam is located at the site of a former mill that was initially constructed in the early 1800s and equipped with a wooden fish ladder system. A fire destroyed the mill and fish ladder in the 1950s, and the dam subsequently fell into a state of disrepair.</p><p>\"For generations, Mill Pond has served as a focal point for the Town of Whiting. In addition to its scenic beauty, Mill Pond is a crucial water source for firefighters, which proved instrumental in saving the town from the destructive Bell Mountain forest fire in 1985,\" said Senator Collins. \"The funding for this project will protect the pond while restoring critical habitat for native fish populations, benefitting current and future generations of anglers.\"</p><p>Following the event at the town office, Senator Collins stopped by Whiting Village School. Principal Scott Johnson and nine students were among the dozens of local residents who wrote letters in support of the Mill Pond Dam project.</p><p>One young student wrote, \"Without the Mill Pond, my house would have had a lot more damage done to it when we had our fire, since they would've had to go to the nearest water supply other than the pond.\"</p><p>Another resident wrote, \"My Dad...was in a battle for his life in the Battle of the Bulge. When boxes of ammunition appeared on the battlefield stamped CRANE'S MILL ~ WHITING, MAINE, he proudly said to his men, 'This is my hometown. THIS is what we are fighting for!' How do you put a value on that? I think of the history of that millpond and dam each time I drive down Route One.\"</p><p>\"Many of you wrote letters supporting this exciting project,\" Senator Collins told those who gathered at the school. \"When I discussed this funding with my Senate colleagues, your letters really made a difference.\"</p><p>The Mill Pond Dam project will establish a fish passage at the first dam on the Orange River while maintaining critical water levels for regional firefighting efforts. The Orange River is a coastal river system with a watershed of approximately 32 square miles. The watershed includes approximately 12 miles of river channel and nearly 2,000 acres of lakes and ponds. The river has been designated as Critical Habitat for Atlantic Salmon, and records confirm the system historically supported river herring and other diadromous fish species.</p><p>Senator Collins successfully sponsored more than 285 projects in Maine totaling more than $500 million in FY22 and FY23 by state government, municipalities, colleges and universities, and non-profits. These projects will promote job creation, workforce training, and economic development; expand access to health care; improve public safety, infrastructure, and community resources; and protect our environment.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-whiting-to-celebrate-29-million-for-mill-pond-dam\">https://www.collins.senate.gov/newsroom/senator-collins-visits-whiting-to-celebrate-29-million-for-mill-pond-dam</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSM12034934</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CH-8HS1-JCCP-0475-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 20, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Senator Collins, the Vice Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, secured the funding in the government appropriations bill that was signed into law last month. The project will preserve the pond and will take a key step to help restore critical habitat for the endangered Atlantic salmon throughout the Orange River Watershed.</p><p>The Mill Pond Dam is located at the site of a former mill that was initially constructed in the early 1800s and equipped with a wooden fish ladder system. A fire destroyed the mill and fish ladder in the 1950s, and the dam subsequently fell into a state of disrepair.</p><p>\"For generations, Mill Pond has served as a focal point for the Town of Whiting. In addition to its scenic beauty, Mill Pond is a crucial water source for firefighters, which proved instrumental in saving the town from the destructive Bell Mountain forest fire in 1985,\" said Senator Collins. \"The funding for this project will protect the pond while restoring critical habitat for native fish populations, benefitting current and future generations of anglers.\"</p><p>Following the event at the town office, Senator Collins stopped by Whiting Village School. Principal Scott Johnson and nine students were among the dozens of local residents who wrote letters in support of the Mill Pond Dam project.</p><p>One young student wrote, \"Without the Mill Pond, my house would have had a lot more damage done to it when we had our fire, since they would've had to go to the nearest water supply other than the pond.\"</p><p>Another resident wrote, \"My Dad...was in a battle for his life in the Battle of the Bulge. When boxes of ammunition appeared on the battlefield stamped CRANE'S MILL ~ WHITING, MAINE, he proudly said to his men, 'This is my hometown. THIS is what we are fighting for!' How do you put a value on that? I think of the history of that millpond and dam each time I drive down Route One.\"</p><p>\"Many of you wrote letters supporting this exciting project,\" Senator Collins told those who gathered at the school. \"When I discussed this funding with my Senate colleagues, your letters really made a difference.\"</p><p>The Mill Pond Dam project will establish a fish passage at the first dam on the Orange River while maintaining critical water levels for regional firefighting efforts. The Orange River is a coastal river system with a watershed of approximately 32 square miles. The watershed includes approximately 12 miles of river channel and nearly 2,000 acres of lakes and ponds. The river has been designated as Critical Habitat for Atlantic Salmon, and records confirm the system historically supported river herring and other diadromous fish species.</p><p>+++</p><p>Senator Collins successfully sponsored more than 285 projects in Maine totaling more than $500 million in FY22 and FY23 by state government, municipalities, colleges and universities, and non-profits. These projects will promote job creation, workforce training, and economic development; expand access to health care; improve public safety, infrastructure, and community resources; and protect our environment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125678071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67C7-5YR1-DYTH-G394-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 20, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from London, United Kingdom, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Smouldering peat fires are responsible for regional haze episodes and cause environmental, social and health crises. Owing to the unique burning characteristics of smouldering peat, identifying and detecting this kind of fire remains a challenge.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include European Research Council Consolidator Grant Haze, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), SCFRI Basic Research Fund. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Imperial College London, \"This work explores smouldering peat gas signatures using emission factor (EF) data from literature. Systematic comparisons and statistical analyses were carried out to investigate 28 forms of EF combinations created from the four most abundant gas species: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia, from smouldering peat, flaming savanna and grassland, agricultural residue and forest fires. Among the candidate gas signatures, the ratio of EF(CO2) to EF(CH4) for smouldering peat showed a significant improvement with statistically different ranges of values (134.6) compared to those from flaming savanna and grassland fire (940.2), agricultural residue fire (434.4 ), forest fire (368.8) and mixed burning peat fires (207.7). Additionally, we found that EF(CO2)/EF(CH4) is independent from fuel composition and could differentiate early ignition from the subsequent spread, making it the best gas signature among those analysed, including CO/CO2 ratio and the Modified Combustion Efficiency.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This work presents the first scientific endeavour developing smouldering gas signatures, contributing to the scientific understanding and remote sensing and early detection of smouldering peat wildfires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Development of Gas Signatures of Smouldering Peat Wildfire From Emission Factors.

According to news originating from Thessaloniki, Greece, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The frequency and severity of large, destructive fires have increased in the recent past, with extended impacts on the landscape, the human population, and ecosystems. Earth observations provide a means for the frequent, wide coverage and accurate monitoring of fire impacts.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include The European Union's Horizon 2020 Research And Innovation Action Programme. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Centre for Research and Technology Hellas: \"This study describes an unsupervised approach for the mapping of burned areas from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which is based on multispectral thresholding, and introduces an adaptive thresholding method. It takes into account the localized variability of the spectral responses in a two-phase approach. The first phase detects areas that are burned with a high probability, while the second phase adaptively adjusts this preliminary mapping by expanding and refining its boundaries. The resulting classification contains two main classes of interest: burned and unburned. The latter is further classified into four (4) fire impact severity classes, according to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and the NASA United States Geological Survey (USGS)'s widely acknowledged nomenclature examples. Three distinct wildfire events are assessed, which occurred during the summers of 2020 and 2021 in Greece and Portugal. The classification accuracy is calculated by juxtaposing the classification outputs to burned area validation maps created through the photointerpretation of very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The corresponding CEMS On-Demand Mapping products are also juxtaposed against the validation maps for comparison purposes.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The accuracy assessment showcases that the unsupervised approach closely follows the capacity provided by the CEMS maps (e.g., the kappa coefficient-k-of the proposed unsupervised approach is 0.91, 0.83 and 0.83 for the events processed, while the CEMS products achieve a k of 0.94, 0.93 and 0.8, respectively). The proposed approach considers the variability of the affected areas' spectral response; thus, it generalizes well to different areas, e.g., areas characterized by different land cover types. It seems to offer an effective means of mapping the wildfire-induced changes, which can be further incorporated and used by forest fire management services and further decision support systems complementary to the CEMS maps.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: An Unsupervised Burned Area Mapping Approach Using Sentinel-2 Images.

Clark also faces sentencing enhancements for arson of multiple structures.</p><p>Orange County Superior Court Judge Patrick Donahue ruled defense attorneys failed to show a conflict of interest in the District Attorney's Office further prosecution of Clark. Clark's trial is set to begin Monday.</p><p>Clark's attorney, Jason Phlaum of the Alternate Defender's Office, filed a motion last month to recuse Spitzer's office from prosecuting the cased based on statements Spitzer made as he was running against then-District Attorney Tony Rackauckas in 2018.</p><p>Phlaum alleged that investigator Albert Banh questioned Clark when he \"showed signs of mental distress.\"</p><p>Phlaum pointed to a news conference Spitzer attended Aug. 8, 2018, in which he characterized Clark as a \"monster.\"</p><p>Spitzer added, \"Who would go out with low humidity and high winds in the highest temperatures this time of year and intentionally set the forest on fire?\"</p><p>Spitzer also made a joke about Clark's first name in reference to the blaze, Phlaum said.</p><p>\"The irony here is not lost on me that his name is Forrest Gordon Clark,\" Spitzer said. \"But he's intentionally destroyed our forest.\"</p><p>Phlaum also noted that Spitzer said the blaze should be renamed from the Holy Jim Fire to the Holy Hell Fire.</p><p>During an interview with a television station, Spitzer advocated for the death penalty for Clark, though the sentence the defendant faced was life.</p><p>The blaze, which started Aug. 6, 2018, in the Holy Jim Canyon area of Trabuco Canyon in the Cleveland National Forest, blackened 23,000 acres and destroyed 18 structures. The blaze was not fully contained until Sept. 13.</p><p>Prosecutors for Spitzer and the Attorney General's Office opposed the motion. If Donahue had granted the motion the Attorney General's Office would have taken over the case.</p><p>Deputy District Attorney Keith Burke argued that while Spitzer was a candidate for district attorney he was also the chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. In social media posts and in news interviews Spitzer was identified as an Orange County supervisor, Burke said.</p><p>Burke argued that Phlaum had not shown there is a conflict of interest, which is the first requirement in granting a recusal motion. Phlaum must also prove the defendant can't get a fair trial, Burke added.</p><p>Burke argued, \"The fact that a prosecutor may view a defendant as a monster, or worse, does not mean that the prosecutor cannot set aside those feelings and prosecute the defendant in an even-handed manner.\"</p><p>Spitzer's advocacy for the death penalty in the case does not pose a conflict because he was making a statement of policy.</p><p>\"This does not in any way lead to a conclusion that Spitzer would fail to apply the law as it actually exists once he assumed the office of district attorney,\" Burke wrote.</p><p>Burke also noted that while Spitzer campaigned on a theme that he would be tougher on crime than Rackauckas he also thanked Rackauckas for filing the case against Clark.</p><p>Burke also noted Spitzer has not added any charges and has actually dismissed two counts.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Alana Cohen Butler offered a similar argument.</p><p>\"The evidence shows DA Spitzer did not reference this case as part of his campaign in 2018,\" Butler wrote. \"Rather, he made statements about this case in his capacity as a representative of the area affected by the fire.</p><p>\"Moreover, this case was charged before DA Spitzer took office and defendant has not shown evidence of unfair treatment in the years this case has been pending under DA Spitzer's administration.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-HOLYFIREJUDGEDENIESMOTIONTORECUSEOCDAFROMPROSECUTINGACCUSEDARSONIST</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67V8-7F51-JCBD-1340-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><timeReceived>6:58 PM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 City News Service, Inc.

Drought Response Committee, meeting via conference call June 30, upgraded the drought designation for all counties in South Carolina.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thirteen counties were upgraded from incipient to moderate drought, including Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton, Darlington, Dillon, Dorchester, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Jasper, Marlboro, Marion, and Williamsburg. The remaining counties were upgraded to the first level of drought, incipient (see map).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As designated by the South Carolina Drought Response Act, incipient is the first level of drought followed by moderate, severe and extreme. There was support from all drought indicators to upgrade the drought status, with some indicators already showing more advanced stages of drought. One of the seven primary indicators evaluated by the Drought Response Committee, the U.S. Drought Monitor, is already showing 52 percent of the state in moderate drought and 10 percent in severe.</p><p>Elliot Wickham, S.C. Department of Natural Resources water resources climatologist, explained that areas in moderate and severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, have been dealing with dry conditions since May. Sixty-day precipitation deficits, along with above-normal temperatures in June, have caused intense soil moisture deficits to develop in those areas.</p><p>Evaporation rates have also been elevated, and areas need more frequent rain and rainfall totals just to keep up with water lost to evaporation. There were multiple reports of 100-degree temperatures, with several locations reaching 103 F. Not only were the daytime temperatures elevated, the nighttime lows were much higher than normal.</p><p>The Drought Committee is tasked with working to agree on a drought declaration for each county that takes into consideration multiple factors, including agriculture, forest fire risk, water supply and water quality. That can be a challenge, S.C. State Climatologist Hope Mizell said, as conditions for each of these factors can vary widely across a particular county. For example, rainfall for portions of Lexington County over the last 30 days ranged from only 0.84 inches to 5.08 inches.</p><p>The committee also tries to avoid a two-level increase in the drought designation unless there is overwhelming consensus among all the indicators.</p><p>The primary drought impacts being reported at this time are to agriculture, and for some counties those impacts are variable and may be significant. Forest fire conditions are also a concern.</p><p>Farmers and agricultural representatives reported impacts across the state.</p><p>\"Rainfall totals have been sporadic,\" said Kayla Stroman, agricultural program specialist with the Farm Service Agency Office, \"Corn and tobacco crops are suffering. Hay production is low, and many producers are already feeding their winter hay and selling cows. Ponds and creeks are much lower than they were a few weeks ago.\"</p><p>In addition to the effect on crops, worsening drought conditions in recent weeks have led to more wildfires in the state, according to the S.C. Forestry Commission.</p><p>In June, the Forestry Commission responded to 196 wildfires that burned more than 1,157 acres. Compared to the 10-year average, that's an increase of more than 172 percent for the number of fires, and an increase of more than 231 percent in the amount of acres burned for the month.</p><p>The long-term drying combined with high temperatures have kept fine fuels such as straw and grasses dry, making it easier for wildfire to ignite. Larger limbs and debris have also dried significantly, resulting in additional fuel available on the ground and leading to more intense wildfires.</p><p>\"These conditions increase the risk of damaging wildfires that can threaten the public, homes and developed areas,\" said Darryl Jones, forest protection chief for the S.C. Forestry Commission. \"And it makes it more challenging and increases safety concerns for firefighters on the ground.\"</p><p>Priyanka More, SCDNR hydrologist, provided an overview of lake, streamflow and groundwater levels, with the majority of the streams and groundwater levels declining due to the lack of beneficial rain and high temperatures. With the drought conditions intensifying, all water systems are asked to review their drought response plans and ordinances and implement as needed.</p><p>Even though the state has received some rainfall relief in areas this week, with more rain in the forecast, the potential rainfall is highly variable. The committee will reconvene in two weeks to review indicators and impacts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125324490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65WR-55P1-DYTH-G20N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 5, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRQJ</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001817</classCode><className>WATER QUALITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F93</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CP14</classCode><className>CONFERENCE CALLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N111940MM</classCode><className>HAY FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N111910MM</classCode><className>TOBACCO FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX587</classCode><className>COLUMBIA, SC, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D2PN</classCode><className>FLORENCE, SC, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D1HU</classCode><className>CHARLESTON, SC, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS156</classCode><className>SOUTH CAROLINA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A lack of rain and rising temperatures have led to dangerously dry conditions in the region, leading to worries of a repeat of the summer of 2018 when major wildfires swept across Sweden in particular. Small wildfires are already burning in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Scotland and experts worry it could get much worse unless there's significant rainfall in coming weeks. Unlike the sun-soaked Mediterranean countries, which have to deal with wildfires every summer, the phenomenon is rare in the countries of northern Europe, where summers are normally cool and wet by comparison. </p><p>\"These countries are relatively new to drought problems,\" said Niclas Hjerdt, head of hydrological forecasting at Sweden's weather agency SMHI. \"We usually have an excess of water up here in Northern Europe and Scandinavia. So there isn't this historic knowledge of how to deal with drought situations that you could find in countries farther south in Europe.\" SMHI says southern Sweden received very little rain in May and not a single drop so far in June, leaving the soil exceptionally dry. The agency says the risk of wildfires is now \"extremely high\" in the southern half of the country, including the Stockholm region, and even though there's some rain in the forecast this weekend, it's unlikely enough to have a significant impact, Hjerdt said. In neighboring Finland, the Finnish Meteorological Institute this week warned of dry terrain and a \"high risk\" of forest fires in most of the country, with a \"very high risk\" in southwestern Finland and the \u00c3\u2026land Islands in the Baltic Sea. Both Sweden and Finland are mostly covered by forests. Similar warnings have been issued in Norway, Denmark and the Baltic countries while Scotland has put in place its fourth wildfire warning in three weeks. Campfires are banned or discouraged in affected areas. Experts say the drought could be related to the transition of La Ni\u00c3\u00b1a to El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o climatic conditions in the Pacific, which shifts weather patterns across the world, and often leads to dry summers in Northern Europe. Hjerdt said it's too early to draw any link to climate change but added that in general, a warming climate is making the Nordic region more vulnerable to forest fires by making summers longer and winters shorter, prolonging the \"vegetative\" season when most precipitation evaporates or transpires rather than sinking deeper into the ground. Temperatures are heating up in the region and are expected to hit 86 degrees Fahrenheit in coming days in Finland - rare for a country straddling the Arctic Circle. \"The heat wave can stay on the surface for next week as well and spread all the way to Lapland,\" said the Finnish institute's meteorologist, Tuomo Bergman, referring to Finland's northernmost area. No substantial rain was expected in Finland until around Midsummer, June 24, he said, when traditional bonfires will be banned. Denmark's farming minister, Jacob Jensen, said that \"the drought has already had a major impact on our agriculture in the past few weeks, and with the prospect of a summer without rain, we will have to have a clear plan for how we can help agriculture in the best possible way.\" The Federation of Swedish Farmers said the drought had already affected grassland crops and could have an impact on cereals. \"If there is no rain soon, future harvests will suffer,\" the industry group said in a statement. It noted that due to the hot and dry summer of 2018, the industry lost almost the entire grain harvest at a cost of approximately 10 billion Swedish kronor ($1.2 billion). Globally, the month of May was a joint-second warmest May on record, according to the European Commission's Copernicus Climate Change Service, with temperatures in Canada and the northern United States particularly warm. Canada saw major wildfires that sent hazardous haze deep into the U.S. In Europe, May was drier than average in southern Scandinavia, the Baltic countries and western Russia, Copernicus said. Meanwhile, most of Southern Europe except Spain and Portugal saw wetter than average conditions, with severe floods in northern Italy. Parts of the Balkans are now experiencing heavy floods caused by strong and persistent rain. Highways and roads have been closed in Serbia and Montenegro due to landslides, some bridges have collapsed, and hundreds of people have been rescued from flooded homes and cars. The southwestern part of Europe has been much drier. This spring in Spain was the hottest - and the second-driest - on record for the country. That has created conditions for wildfires breaking out early this year and the need for restrictions on water for agriculture, industry and filling private swimming pools in the hardest-hit areas. In mainland France, the water resources are still feeling the effects of a drought last summer, with two-thirds of the national water tables below normal levels. Localized forest fires have broken out in parts of France including regions such as Lorraine and Vosges, where extreme heat and forest fires are rare. Sweden saw the worst forest fires in its modern history in 2018 during an unusually dry and warm summer. The wildfires also affected Denmark, Finland and Norway. \"We are currently in a serious situation, it is similar to the one that prevailed before the summer of 2018,\" Sweden's Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin said Thursday, adding airborne firefighting units were on standby.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-00000188c450d93ba19cdd7052f40000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PF-2JD1-JBSK-R00H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 16, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By ensuring community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response, airports contribute to keeping Canadians safe and connected from coast to coast to coast. Canadians rely on safe and well-maintained local and regional airports to support vibrant communities.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in Manitoba.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, 15 airports in Manitoba will receive over $5.1 million from the Government of Canada for projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews, and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>Berens River</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Bloodvein River</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>to install wildlife control fencing - $940,655</p><p>Flin Flon</p><p>to purchase runway friction tester - $6,420</p><p>to purchase a grader - $438,000</p><p>to replace runway approach lighting $90,329</p><p>Gods Lake Narrows</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>to purchase a loader mounted snow blower - $210,000</p><p>Norway House</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Oxford House</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Pukatawagan</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Red Sucker Lake</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>South Indian Lake</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>St. Andrews</p><p>to purchase a sweeper - $395,200</p><p>St. Theresa Point</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>Tadoule Lake</p><p>to purchase a compactor (tow behind) - $50,000</p><p>to install wildlife control fencing - $1,029,573</p><p>The Pas/Grace Lake</p><p>to purchase a loader mounted snow blower - $234,000</p><p>Thompson</p><p>to purchase a snowplow - $358,960</p><p>York Landing</p><p>to install wildlife control fencing - $926,610</p><p>The equipment will be used in maintaining aircraft movement surfaces and the removal and control of ice and snow from airside surfaces such as runways, taxiways and the apron. For airports with a gravel runway, a compactor is used to compress the gravel on the runway, creating a stable surface for safe landing and takeoff operations. The wildlife fencing will keep large mammals away from secure airfield areas.</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $20.8 million provided under the Program in 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Flin Flon, Gods Lake Narrows, Lac Brochet, Red Sucker Lake, Shamattawa, and Thompson airports.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125541155</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66T3-VT81-DYTH-G2MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 26, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Please go ahead.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>PAUL RIVETT, INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, GREENFIRST FOREST PRODUCTS INC: Thank you very much, [Joe] and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 earnings call. As Joanne said, I am Paul Rivett, the Executive Chair of Green First. Today, I'm joined by Joel Fournier, our CEO, Terry skipping 10 seals cap paper anchor for our Interim CFO, Michel Lessard, our President, and of course, Gwen Webster, our Chief of Staff, the end of 2023 marked a significant year for us. We rightsized our balance sheet and our business, putting a focus on Ontario. We centralized our paper and lumber operations and brought on board, a new CEO to well along with a leader for the paper operations.</p><p>Terry, as we continue in 2024, I'm confident that the steps we took in 2023 position us well, not just for 2024, but for the years to come, we are already starting to witness a positive trend in lumber prices, which bodes well for our future prospects. Despite high borrowing rates currently prevailing, there is a shift in momentum with the US, Federal Reserve and Bank Canada, indicating potential interest rates cut into rate cuts at the end of this year.</p><p>This Boost is much-needed for the lumber markets as the significant rate increases in recent years have negatively impacted US housing starts and of course, buyer sentiment resulting in a slowdown in housing construction in the longer term, the lack of available housing inventory, record levels of immigration in the US, and Canada, as well as the growing demographic driven demand for homes are expected to have a positive impact on lumber markets.</p><p>We are starting to see analysts and industry experts increasingly mentioning these factors, and we firmly believe that the lumber industry has passed the inflection point. We anticipate positive tailwinds in pricing in the upcoming quarters. Please also keep in mind there is a decrease in the supply of lumber in the market due to numerous closures in British Columbia and other parts of North America that is continuing in 2024. Greenfirst is fortunate to operate in the business friendly province of Ontario.</p><p>On a more somber note, we are still facing continued pricing pressures on paper products, but we have tremendous F'08 and the abilities of Terry and his team to significantly increase productivity at cap paper. Our management team will take us through the results of the quarter and the year, starting off with Ankit, giving us the financial highlights over to you, Ankit.</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, GREENFIRST FOREST PRODUCTS INC: Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. The Company's net loss in Q4 was $21.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA of negative $18 million. This compares to a net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of $2.7 million, where adjusted EBITDA was $8 million positive. The third quarter included a US. $7 million recovery related to the 2021 duties paid following the US Department of Commerce's final determination of its fourth administrative review.</p><p>Net lumber sales recorded in the fourth quarter were $70.1 million compared to $63.6 million in Q three or 10%. Higher lumber EBITDA compared to Q3 was impacted by lower pricing and cable pricing lowered in the first half of Q4. However, we began to see a rebound in the back half of Q4. This was primarily due to positive sentiment from the Fed Reserve and Bank of Canada, giving clear signs to hold interest rates. We also had higher volumes in Q4 as markets started to recover in the latter half.</p><p>The paper segment was negatively impacted in Q4 due to maintenance related activities that lowered the rate of production at the paper mill. Net sales in the paper segment were relatively flat at $33.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to Q4 of last year. Net loss improved by approximately $4.3 million and adjusted EBITDA includes improved by $9.4 million. This is primarily due to a lower cost profile and duties paid in the lumber segment, partially offset by lower lumber prices and unfavorable results from the paper sector.</p><p>For the fiscal year 2023 we saw a net loss of $48.8 million with an adjusted EBITDA of negative $30.2 million. This compares to a net loss of $4.1 million and adjusted EBITDA positive $39.4 million in 2022. For the lumber segment, adjusted EBITDA was substantially lower compared to 2022. Net sales in lumber were $268.4 million versus $398.1 million in 2022. This was primarily due to the significant decline in pricing compared to the high seen in the first half of 2022, driven by monetary tightening to partially compensate for the decline. Our cost profile improved as a result of overall higher volumes produced and lower stumpage fees, which reduces lumber prices decline.</p><p>Additionally, the company recorded a [CAD7 million] of duties recovery in 2023 and paid a lower duty rate on its shipments to the US from August first onward. Overall, 2023 volumes were also higher as there were less challenges related to logistics compared to 2022. For the Paper segment, EBITDA was higher compared to 2022.</p><p>Net sales were $141 million versus $94 million in 2022. This was primarily driven by higher volume from the restarting of the second paper machine. 2023 saw significant improvement in unit costs from having two operational paper machines during the year. This was partially offset by a decline in prices for paper products. In 2023, the company saw positive results for a majority of the year in its paint paper segment. However, this trend was negatively impacted by maintenance and downtime in Q4. Corporate and SG&amp;A improved due to lower incentive related costs and the recovery of a previously written off AR balance in 2023.</p><p>For 2023, finance costs were $2 million compared to $12.8 million in 2022. This was driven by having a lower debt balance and interest rates on its outstanding debt in 2023. For majority of 2022, the company paid interest on its previously held US-denominated high-yield debt. Our debt balance at the end of the year was $23 million as a result of net premium from net repayments for the year of $31 million. This included the repayment of the term loan portion of the credit facility, making the company no longer subject to financial covenant ratios under its credit agreement.</p><p>We continue to manage our liquidity through the volatile lumber markets and harvesting season that require significant investments in raw materials. We manage this prudently by ensuring tight inventory management at the mill level, supplemented by drawdowns against our asset-based lending facility for the seasonal spend. Our lending facility is supported by borrowings against our inventory.</p><p>As such, higher levels of inventory are supported by the credit facility. During the harvesting season. We also leveraged our credit facilities equipment financing portion in order to finance purchases under key strategic projects. This financing was Acsis subsequent to year.</p><p>I will now pass it over to Joel first for his commentary on our lumber operations throughout.</p><p>JOEL FOURNIER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GREENFIRST FOREST PRODUCTS INC: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Good morning, all the shareholders, analysts and my colleagues on this call. I'm honored to speak to you today as the newly appointed CEO of Green First, since I think I take on this role, I've been impressed by the dedication and talent of our team for those who recall during the last call, I mentioned that I had the opportunity to meet with all the employees across the sawmill operations.</p><p>We are making progress and together, we're actively working towards a common goal to improve the business. After my first few after my first four months with the company, we had identified short-term opportunity to make the company more profitable. Our focus is on implementing rapid and cost-effective changes that can yield immediate and fast results.</p><p>Our short-term objective is to drive swift and efficient improvements in our operation, processes and systems in the short term, we continue to be careful with spending and we manage our cost effectively, but we're also working on developing a long-term and midterm strategic plan to grow the business. We'll be unveiling a comprehensive strategic plan in the second quarter of 2024. That will outline clearly the vision for the future and the steps we need to take to achieve it with this plan, I'm confident that we can position the company to be profitable in the long term.</p><p>We have access to work supply that will support our future growth, and this is very important. It's a unique situation we are at compared to other province in Canada who unfortunately are experience a decline in there was supply due to factors such as ship such as forest fire and second station and other.</p><p>Additionally, we also benefit from a further favorable political environment and a lower stable log costs compared to our peers in Canada our main objective with this strategic plan, our to utilize the wood available to grow our current business in Ontario as part of the strategic plan. We are also currently looking and evaluating our SG&amp;A costs, and we are expecting to announce a substantial reduction compared to 2023 in the coming weeks.</p><p>Our goal is to have a cost profile that will be competitive for the long-term strategic capital expenditure cannot be done without the mindset of continuous improvement. So, to continue to drive a culture of continuous improvement across the company, we have identified specific non-capital expenditure related initiative to drive a saving of approximately $14.5 million compared to our 2023 results in the last quarter, we saw the completion of the decentralization and the engagement of dairy skipping.</p><p>Then as our new paper mill steel, Terry will be discussing the detail of this change in our plan moving forward for the paper and paper mill very shortly. With the successful splits of our lumber and paper mill operation, we are now able to focus on optimizing each business separately, our General Manager and her team are being empowered to make quick decisions and drive the success of each respective facilities. Does this centralization will enable us to adapt to market change more quickly. And if and effectively with the ultimate goal in mind to improve and the performance and the profitability of each business carries and site on the paper mill will provide greater clarity on our strategy moving forward.</p><p>In the beginning of 2023, the company closed on the sale of the Quebec sawmill and related operation for minus $94 million. This move, although the company to focus its manage resources and capital expenditures on its more profitable sawmills. Based on North American industry data coming from FEA, our mill are competitive, and we feel this can be further improved with our short and long-term afford to increase production and continue to lower our production cost.</p><p>In August 2023, we were pleased to receive news that the duty rate has decreased significantly from around 20% to 8%. To give you color on this, the change resulted in a substantial cost saving of approximately $9 million as you are probably aware, we are actively pursuing the return of our deposit duty, recognizing that this process may take several years to complete. We currently have $80 million US. of duty on deposits as we speak.</p><p>As we continue to look at opportunities to monetize our non-core assets, we are in the process to sell and maximize the value of the king of Allen located on Lake of the woods. We are working with the planning and design firm. We aim to attract potential buyers and secure the best outcome for the land and for the company, the company is finalizing and a new non-binding letter of intent with a third party. No, we are optimistic about the anticipated uptick in the housing.</p><p>As Paul mentioned, and we there is a presently and housing supply deficit in both United States and Canada. And it was recently announced by the eight the US government, but they're going to put the housing strategy in top of their budget for 2024. And presently there they're discussing to put a plan in place to promote building on new houses and they were trying to close the gap with now with this program that they're trying to they're putting in place as we speak.</p><p>So, it is expected also that the interest rate will begin to decrease later this year, and that will foster a higher price and demand for wood products as long as what the US government is trying to implement to promote the building of houses. So we will be prepare for a lumber market response and will capitalize on the increased demand by effectively using our wood resources and aligning our growth strategy with the need of the housing market, we aim to position ourselves for success and long-term sustainability in the industry.</p><p>On the operational side, we saw an increase in both our sales and shipments from our lumber segment this quarter over the third quarter. This was primarily driven by increased demand as a result of positive trend in the US housing starts and central bank signaled signaling a halt of future interest rate hikes. Additionally, volumes continued to main low field inventory level, which helped to increase demand and raise price.</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 2023. Lumber production saw a slight increase over the third quarter. This uptick in production was primarily driven by less maintenance downtime. Overall lumber production for the entire year of 2023 also showed an increase of 6% from the previous year's in Q1 of 2024. With the initiative we put in place, we are seeing a very positive trend with our production in the month of January and February. Our sawmill operation broke several production records. That's it for this section. I will pass this over to Terry, I skipped them. Thank you.</p><p>TERRY SKIFFINGTON, GREENFIRST FOREST PRODUCTS INC: Okay. Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Today marks my two months anniversary at Green First long history in the pulp and paper industry, including previous roles as COFROG. pulp and paper in New Zealand has no manager for Resolute now the Atlas facility and Thunder Bay and previous no manager and VP for the cap cups and paper mill have a clear understanding of these assets along with paper grades, North American and international markets and the importance of the local community.</p><p>Last year, I was engaged by green first to advise on paper operations. During this time, I saw the potential for future and felt compelled to introduce sustainable long-term solutions based on the models that I have successfully worked on in Canada and around the globe, particularly with respect to being successful and competitive in the export markets.</p><p>It came on board as the CEOCA. paper in early January with an objective quickly returning the operation to positive earnings from more of a strategic point of view. We are also active with the Ministry of Natural Resources with their biomass strategy. And we are doing a feasibility study for a biomass cogeneration power plant at the paper mill.</p><p>I acknowledge that our shareholders and the team may be disappointed with the results from the last quarter and implementing changes throughout the entire mill. Would we'll start turning operational performance here around as early as Q2 of this year. The objective has been and still remains for the paper mill operations to consume the sawmill residuals, both biomass and chips in a manner that produces positive cash flow.</p><p>A couple of points on the fourth quarter of 2023 performance. We continue with the completion of the second paper machine. Just for startup. We were able to achieve that target operational performance in the fourth quarter and PM five operational performance was close to target up until the end of the third quarter.</p><p>The mill made a positive contribution to EBITDA for the first three quarters of 2023. However, prices declined in numerous operational issues contributed to the negative EBITDA in the fourth quarter as some as mentioned by Ankit, the mill experienced a planned capital shutdown in late October that did not go as expected, and there were many operational problems and challenges post that shutdown.</p><p>As mentioned in my opening remarks, we are aggressively making changes at the pace now and are underway with the cost reduction plan, targeting all levels of the P&amp;L and expecting to return to our consumptions pre-COVID levels with two machines operating at standard, and I will pass back over to 12 to complete the earnings call in a sustainability. No. one. Our entire company is incredibly proud.</p><p>JOEL FOURNIER: Okay. Thank you very much, Terry, you are right. We are extremely proud proud of our forestry operation based solely on target where we focus on sustainable practice. We prioritize and governmental stewardship by promoting biodiversity maintaining forest health and complete digitization of the tree. We harvest for commitment to sustainability, extend to all aspects of our business, ensuring that our lumber and paper products are presence safely this not only protect our employees and the entertainment, but also long-term value for our stakeholders.</p><p>I would like to say and mention that we're proud or Gordon constant forest new caps casing has been FSC certified for 20 years now and was the first for us to be FSC certified in the Canadian boreal forest, showcasing our dedication to sustainable forestry. Third team is committed to excellence and implementing best practice for a sustainable future.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thank you very much to all. So that ends the formal part of our presentation and turn it back to Joel, for to take questions, please. We'll take submit your questions into the online portal. Thank you.</p><p>JOEL FOURNIER: Okay. So, our first question is, can you provide any insight on expense reduction initiatives. So I turn it over to you, Joel, for that one, please.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Okay.</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR: Thank you, Bob. And I can share with this group that we have been comprehensively reviewing reparation and part of our cost profile improvement is due to finding some saving in video. We did improve our cost from last year from 2022 to 2023, and we have a comprehensive plan right now in place to continue to reduce our costs going forward for 2024.</p><p>In fact, like I mentioned in my script, we did in a defy $14.5 million of cost reduction and other productivity improvements for 2024. This plan is supported with clear initiatives, you know, clear action plan who's going to do what by when. And we're going to continue to track this and make sure we deliver. We do expect our SG&amp;A also and overhead to improve in the first half of this year.</p><p>Like I mentioned earlier, we did put in place a comprehensive SG&amp;A reduction plan and we're going to make some announcements in the next coming weeks.</p><p>One, ZEAL, what will be the ceiling. In addition, our goal is to increase production. And like I said, we do have initiative in place to increase production every time we can increase production that will reduce our unit cost and will make the company our more profitable in the long term. There's many initiative we do have in place to increase production. One of them is we didn't implement an initiative program with the employee, and we're very pleased with the results that we see all across the mill so far.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thanks to our thanks to all, and I would add that we are seeing productivity records being broken at our mills and up when the Board hired you. Well, it was up this. It was a singular focus on it productivity and efficiency and getting us to first quartile and do all singularly focused on that. We have a we have a follow-up question with respect to. Can you elaborate on this substantial cost reduction program.</p><p>I think, Joel, you just mentioned that like to what Joel, will be coming back in the second quarter with an announcement on a comprehensive cost reduction plan and we look forward to giving that to you. As I said, we're you've got a singular focus on getting us to first quartile top quartile and done and will be produced giving that to shareholders.</p><p>And second for our next question is when do you expect to receive $9 million in duty income? And can you provide the overpayments for 2022 and 2023? I think Ankit here.</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR: Yes, I think just the just again to reiterate, the $9 million and Canadian is the difference that we recorded in 2023, which represents a deduct the delta between what we paid in 2021 versus the final rate that was determined to be equally applicable to 2021. We are uncertain on the timing of the settlement, and it's subject to the industry-wide settlement. As Joel mentioned, our total overpayment, though, compared to our peers, is approximately USD22 million but subsequent to August first, we did align ourselves with peers, which has indeed helped our bottom line and cash flow from operations.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thanks. And our next question is with respect to newsprint pricing falling, do you expect to shut the second line down or take downtime?</p><p>Tom, I think that's clearly a carry question before I hand it over, though, I would emphasize that we have seen our competitors shutting down facilities. It's quite unfortunate for Northern Ontario. We've seen Domtar's shut the Espanola mill, and we've seen the Terrace Bay facility shut down and historically been feast or famine on chips and the utilization of chips.</p><p>And right now there is a overwhelming supply of chips that can be consumed. Our mill in Northeastern Ontario is extremely important to the Northern Ontario ecosystem. And we're very focused on doing everything we can under Terry's leadership to make that mill as good as it possibly can be. But with lumber with that sorry, with paper prices as low as they are, it is very challenging. So, Terry, I'll hand it over to you to answer specifically.</p><p>TERRY SKIFFINGTON: Yeah, Okay. Thanks, Paul. Yes, just three reiterate the market conditions right now, just it's very, very difficult. Pricing has come down significantly through 2023, and it's not appearing to rebound anytime soon at this time in terms of cap being able to maneuver, let's say, in these conditions, our focus at this time, it is all about increasing our operational performance.</p><p>And as Joel had mentioned, getting our unit costs down the simple most effective and fastest way to do that is through increasing plant output. And then secondly, it's every line of the P&amp;L in terms of our cost structure to pull out costs, particularly with our consumption levels.</p><p>And what I mean by consumption is all of the purchase materials, everything from energy to chemicals to all the supplies that we need to make it make a ton of newsprint, get those consumptions levels back down to where they can be and where they were, let's say, pre-COVID.</p><p>So that is our particular focus right now to lever up. The truth is all options remain very possible. We'll continue to evaluate other options, but at this time, it's very much to get that mill positioned where it can be competitive in these in these very difficult market conditions.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Okay. Thank you very, very quickly because we did talk a little bit about the Convera land, but there's a further question with respect to what we're doing with that land. And so Michel, can you talk a little bit more specifically with respect to Kinross?</p><p>MICHEL LESSARD, PRESIDENT, GREENFIRST FOREST PRODUCTS INC: Yeah, sure. So on Kinross. So we no longer have that active LOI for now, but we are in active discussions to renew. And I would like also to add that we are also in discussion with another group who's interested to the entire property. So what we're looking at at the end of the day is to sell the entire property and to use that money in front of CapEx in our sites.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: So there's a question with respect to going concern note in our financial statements on Ankit, that's over to you that to address that please inefficient things called?</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR: So the going concern note it is cautionary in nature, just like the several risks we disclosed in our a unless one thing I can comment is the Board and management is very confident on the several meaningful levers that we've disclosed.</p><p>As part of that note, which includes the potential sale of non-core assets, just like Michel alluded to the canola oil and our availability under our credit agreement that we're exploring. So again, it is it is cautionary in nature. But from a management and Board perspective, we're pretty confident that as we pull these levers and as lumber prices recover, we'll be in a position to eliminate this note in the short term.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thank you again. And I'll just add that we are continuing. As we've mentioned in the past, we do have a very clean balance sheet and the sales of assets that we've sold, not only have the property, Quebec mills. And that has allowed us to take off the extremely high expensive debt that had that had very impressive covenants.</p><p>And as accurate as said, to put us in a position to have a very clean ABL that we have availability on. But we are continuing to look at monetizing, as we've talked about several times already on this call that can Orlando and we do have a very large pension surplus and we are also looking at monetizing other available property.</p><p>And there is a question with respect to the US. duties. We are always looking at ways to monetize that. Again, we do feel we have significant liquidity and so we don't want to do anything that would be done at a below market price because we do feel that these areas of liquidity will be able to support some of the CapEx initiatives that Joel is looking at.</p><p>But Tom, but please rest assured that we are looking at a number of available opportunities for us to get liquidity and do have and we can act on. I now go to there's a question with respect to the CapEx budget, sorry, adjustments because I was mentioning CapEx. And Joe, maybe you can talk to that.</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR: Thank you, both. So, the question here was around CapEx and how it's allocated right now between growing maintenance. So you know, the way we allocate their CapEx at the beginning of the year, it was heavily towards maintenance of business. The market was uncertain. You know the price were a little bit lower last year. So we continue to be prudent with where we spend money.</p><p>So we identify only critical and will be that needs to be done in the middle going forward. But you know, we do have a lot of good projects in our back pocket and ready to go project with a high royalty. So as the market and as the market improves or continue to improve and liquidity become more available then relative to entering some of those strategic CapEx in 2024.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thanks to others that there's a question with respect to where we are on utilization and utilization being in the 81% range in 2023 and how we expect to change that I guess to all? That's clearly a question for you.</p><p>ANKIT KAPOOR: Thank you both. So, you know, as I mentioned in my script there, we are always looking in ways to improve production because improving production means for the sawmill side that we're going to reduce costs. So we have several initiatives in place to increase our production for 2024, and we should expect to see an improvement this year.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: But the good thing there is a question with respect to cost pressures and trends and what we're seeing with respect to labor, raw material costs, et cetera. Maybe that's a joint question, maybe for you, Terry and say.</p><p>TERRY SKIFFINGTON: Okay, sure. Thanks, Paul. So from a newsprint side, then it's an interesting question that, but the traditional cost pressures would come from fiber and energy. And however, that is not the case at this time. As Paul mentioned, there is a surplus of fiber in Ontario and the energy costs actually are actually quite stable or even slightly declining.</p><p>And for us, that means electricity and natural gas, the cost pressures are really all about the consumables. And we're feeling the same thing that every business and person feels which is with the high inflation over the last number of years, including everything that we purchase for us for running the facility, supplies and services, all of our consumables.</p><p>All of those have seen significant increases in price, let's say, over the last number of years. And as I mentioned earlier. So our focus at this time was to get our consumptions down as much as we possibly can. And actually, what I said before is back to pre-COVID levels where the mill was running with significantly lower consumptions than we are today.So it is very achievable. And that and that's basically how we're dealing with these external cost pressures.</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Okay. Thank you, Terry. And I mean, you know a few things I would like to have your own for the Company and maybe for some of those sites, everybody know that during COVID and after COVID, we have serious inflation in all the consumable that we have across the business. You know, I am being many years in the business.</p><p>I saw some months, some consumable that we had in the range of 30% after COVID. So but having said that, if you look at our costs from 2022 and 2023, we were able to reduce our cost by increasing production. And going forward, we do have a comprehensive plan to look at every and all consumables that we have in the sawmills. And we're challenging everything here to trying to continue to reduce the cost and how much money we need to operate the business.</p><p>The question is also around the labor So leverage is definitively a challenge all across North America. But I would say it's a challenge for us, too. But I would say we're kind of fortunate in a way that our turnover is lower than some of our peers in other regions. Having said that, we do have comprehensive initiative to trying to retain and attract more talent.</p><p>So, we want to be the employer. We want to be an employer of choice. We're looking to drive more engagement within the business to make sure we retain our employees and reduce the turnover rate so we could keep our labor where it needs to be.</p><p>JOEL FOURNIER: Thanks, Paul. And we're starting to run out of time thoughts. I will take one more question. There's a question here with respect to such a large US duties on deposit, our waste acceptable to an opportunistic buyer of the company. And what I would say is there are large deposits in all of the competitors in Canada. But we are rest assured our shareholders should rest assured, we are doing everything we can to look at opportunities to monetize those duties.</p><p>But we want to do it that at a fair price. So, we will work with third parties to find that if it's doable. But if it's not doable at a fair price we do not want to we do not want to liquidate at something that would be seen as unreasonable by our shareholders. But with respect to a an opportunistic buyer, we don't think that that's necessarily going to come into play at all of our competitors have had these large duties on deposit.</p><p>So, with that, I'd say thank you very much, everyone, for all your support and you look, we look forward to talking to a very shortly on the first quarter.</p><p>I'm confident in our continuing ability to drive further success at Green First particularly with respect to the leadership of these two, gentlemen, Joel and Terry driving efficiencies, we also want to thank our candidates and Sean from our Board for their contributions to the Board and thanks again to everyone on this call and all of our shareholders. Thanks again to you for your ongoing support and confidence in Green First, and we look forward to speaking to you soon about the first quarter. So, bye for now. And thanks very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

To study the mysterious force known as dark energy behind this accelerating expansion of the universe, scientists at the University of California, Irvine are using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to map more than 40 million galaxies, quasars and stars. Today, the DESI collaboration publicly released its first batch of data, with nearly 2 million objects for researchers to explore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is the start of an ambitious five-year cosmic cartography project, and we are delighted it went so smoothly,\" said UC Irvine Professor of Physics &amp; Astronomy David Kirkby, DESI principal investigator at UCI. \"We are off to a great start in our quest to learn more about dark matter and dark energy, and we're excited to discover what our final cosmic maps will reveal.\"</p><p>According to Kirkby, DESI has a unique method of capturing the cosmic light from the far reaches of the universe. Instead of taking a single image of each portion of the sky, it uses 5,000 tiny robots to precisely position optical fibers to gather light from more than 100,000 galaxies each night and accurately measure their distance.</p><p>\"Since this light has been traveling through the expanding universe for billions of years, DESI is able to peer back in time to study our cosmic history,\" said Kirkby.</p><p>\"I am really grateful to have the opportunity to work hands-on with the DESI instrument and robots,\" says Abby Bault, a UCI Ph.D. candidate working with Kirkby. \"I am helping to improve the robot software and looking forward to testing a new generation of robots for future experiments. Not many people have the opportunity to work on instrumentation and science during their Ph.D., and I am really excited that our group here at UC Irvine does both.\"</p><p>The UCI team designed an interactive virtual tour that provides an ant's eye view of the 5,000 robotic positioners, viewable on smart phones or through a web browser.</p><p>Today the collaboration released an 80-terabyte data set recorded during the six months of the experiment's \"survey validation\" phase in 2020 and 2021. In this period between turning on the instrument and beginning the official science run, researchers made sure their plan for using the telescope would meet their science goals.</p><p>The team also had to meet the challenges of COVID 19, which prevented scientists from working in groups at the telescope. There was also a large forest fire in June 2022 that surrounded the telescope and closed the only access road for months afterwards. Despite these obstacles, UCI scientists designed key components necessary for smooth and efficient operations, including a novel exposure-time calculator and a sky brightness monitor.</p><p>In addition to releasing the data set, the researchers published a papers related to the early data release, which include early measurements of galaxy clustering, studies of rare objects and descriptions of the instrument and survey operations. The new papers build on DESI's first measurement of the cosmological distance scale that was published in April, which used the first two months of routine survey data (not included in the early data release) and showed DESI's ability to accomplish its design goals.</p><p>The DESI early data release is now freely available for anyone to download and analyze. The software developed by DESI to process this data is also freely available for others to review and build upon.</p><p>\"DESI sets a high standard for open and reproducible science,\" said Kirkby.</p><p>\"In addition to the raw data, we are releasing a set of value-added catalogs of data with accompanying analysis to allow scientists to make use of data not provided in the official public data release,\" said Dylan Green, a UCI Ph.D. candidate in Kirkby's research group. \"My job was to coordinate the release of these catalogs, which allowed me to interact with a lot of different people throughout the collaboration all working on very different science topics.\"</p><p>There is more of data yet to come from the experiment. DESI is currently two years into its five-year run and ahead of schedule on its quest to collect more than 40 million redshifts. The survey has already catalogued more than 26 million astronomical objects in its science run and is adding more than a million per month.</p><p>DESI is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science user facility. Additional support for DESI is provided by the National Science Foundation, the Science and Technologies Facilities Council of the United Kingdom, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico, the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain and by the DESI member institutions.</p><p>Kitt Peak National Observatory is a program of NSF's NOIRLab (<url normalizedValue=\"https://noirlab.edu/public/\">https://noirlab.edu/public/</url>).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.uci.edu/2023/06/13/dark-energy-spectroscopic-instrument-early-data-release-holds-nearly-2-million-objects/\">https://news.uci.edu/2023/06/13/dark-energy-spectroscopic-instrument-early-data-release-holds-nearly-2-million-objects/</url></p><p>Contact: Brian Bell, 949/565-5533, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bpbell@uci.edu\">bpbell@uci.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8186862 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8186862</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68G0-MG11-DYG2-R4YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 14, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
