And tonight, new video appears to show Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin just as the chief of Britain's MI6 says Putin had to cut a deal with the mercenary leader, quote, \"to save his own skin\". Then what we are learning this hour about the U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea apparently willingly, including what charges he faced in South Korea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then later, a new perspective on the heat wave making Europe's tourists sweat. Our Richard Quest is feeling the heat in France, he'll join us live. But first, Yevgeny Prigozhin's whereabouts have been a mystery after his short-lived mutiny in Russia, if you remember, last month. Now, for the first time since the Wagner Group founder is re-emerging, new video appears to show him greeting his mercenaries in Belarus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving there if you remember was part of the deal Prigozhin made with President Vladimir Putin to call off the mutiny and not be prosecuted. Well, CNN cannot definitely say whether the speaker is in fact, Prigozhin. CNN has though geolocated the footage towards this huge military base, southeast of Minsk, and the meta data suggest it was filmed on Tuesday.</p><p>Meantime, the West has largely stayed silent on the man who defied Vladimir Putin, but our team sat down with the head of MI6; the British spy agency to try to understand what's really happening inside the Kremlin as Ukraine's of course, counteroffensive carries on. Here is what he told our Nick Paton Walsh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICHARD MOORE, HEAD, MI6, BRITAIN: If you look at Putin's behavior on that day, Prigozhin started off, I think as a traitor at breakfast, he had been pardoned by supper, and then a few days later, he was invited for tea. So there are some things I know, even the chief of MI6 finds a little bit difficult to try and interpret in terms of who is in and who is out.</p><p>He really didn't fight back against Prigozhin. He cut a deal to save his skin using the good officers of the -- of the leader of Belarus. So, look, even I can't see inside Putin's head, but the only person who has been -- it's -- well, the only people who have been talking about escalation and nuclear weapons are Putin and a handful of henchmen around him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Richard Moore was speaking to our Nick Paton Walsh, of course, important to point out, it's rare for the head of MI6 to make these kinds of comments publicly. And Nick joins me now from Prague. And Nick, as this video emerges of Prigozhin in Belarus, I wonder what you -- what Richard Moore told you in terms of the drama.</p><p>What he made of the drama surrounding Prigozhin, the deal that was cut. How did he interpret that deal and what critically happens next here?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR: Yes, it's interesting asking Sir Richard Moore about the whereabouts and whether or not Prigozhin who hadn't until this apparent appearance of him in this grainy, dark video being seen since the Saturday night after the failed armed rebellion in Rostov in the back of an SUV.</p><p>Asked whether he was alive and healthy, and Richard Moore said look, we believed he was floating about. Now as part of the speech he gave, taking questions afterwards from journalists here in Prague, rare public comments as you say. He outlined essentially as you heard in those televised comments, a vision of what had gone down during that failed mutiny that was very similar to the public statements that the Kremlin had indeed made.</p><p>Now, it may sound odd, but so much of what you would expect the Kremlin to put out to be misinformation, misguided, it's in a whole separate story to be happening behind closed doors. But that was not it appeared from this reading from basically the most public statements we've heard from western Intelligence on that issue since it happened.</p><p>That was pretty much what they believe really went down. That indeed, Prigozhin seem to have moved towards Moscow, changed his mind on the way and then Putin seems to have accepted this deal from Alexander Lukashenko; the president of Belarus because he felt he had to.</p><p>[14:05:00]</p><p>And so, that flip-flopping you heard about the remarkable quote there of the breakfast, he's a traitor, by Supper, he's pardoned, and then a couple of days later, he's having tea, was, I think about trying to express how weak they see Putin after that extraordinary moment, how it's exposed fissures in the Russian elite.</p><p>There's still, I think, is fair to say, working out where it really leaves Moscow at this particular point. One interesting thing though, is at this stage, they believe Russia is still unlikely to regain momentum on the battlefield. And I think it's yet for us to see percolate through necessarily to the frontlines of this war in Ukraine. Isa?</p><p>SOARES: Nick Paton Walsh for us this evening in Prague, thanks very much, Nick. Well, CNN is tracking the Wagner Group through satellite images and social media videos. The first convoy of Wagner forces arrived at a Belarusian base on Monday, and more vehicles are now piling in. Our Fred Pleitgen has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly a month after Wagner's mutiny, one of the biggest threats to Vladimir Putin's power, the Wagner mercenaries are on the move to Belarus. Social media channeled posting videos of massive convoys rolling in that direction.</p><p>And now, CNN analysis of satellite images from the company Planet Labs and from Airbus show Wagner fighters have arrived at a formerly abandoned base southeast of Minsk with two more large convoys still on the way. The mercenaries are already getting to work, training Belarusian troops.</p><p>\"They've been in combat, and this is undoubtedly a very useful experience for our army\", this Belarusian soldier says. \"We have not participated in combat activities since the end of the Afghan war.\" They saw some of the heaviest combat in Russia's war against Ukraine and where some of Vladimir Putin's most valuable fighters.</p><p>But after the uprising, they've had to shutter their main base in southern Russia. \"The base ceases to exist\", this fighter says. Wagner private military company is relocating to new areas.</p><p>YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD, WAGNER MERCENARY GROUP: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: And Yevgeny Prigozhin, once a powerful businessman and mercenary leader is essentially AWOL. The most recent picture circulating on social media channels affiliated with him showing Prigozhin in just his underwear on a cot, though it's unclear when and where it was taken. The Kremlin recently even claimed officially Wagner doesn't exist.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: It never existed, the Kremlin spokesman said, and this is a matter for further study and consideration, generally, this is a fairly complex issue about the legal status of such companies. But Putin has also made clear he wants to retain the fighters. A spokesman saying the Russian leader suggested putting this man, former Russian Colonel Andrei Troshev, nicknamed \"Gray Hair\" in charge of the Wagner Group.</p><p>But with Wagner now seemingly relocating to Belarus, the U.S. and its allies fear the mercenary outfit could not only re-emerge in Ukraine, but even destabilized NATO's eastern flank. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: And later this hour, CNN is on the ground where Russia launched more airstrikes on Odessa. The city's mayor calls today's attack one of the most horrible nights of the war, and of course, it comes just days after Russia pulled out of a deal that allowed Ukraine to safely export its grain from Odessa's ports. A look at how the world's most vulnerable people may pay the ultimate prize as food insecurity reaches new heights. We'll have that in about 20 minutes or so.</p><p>We are learning more about the American soldier who crossed the DMZ line into North Korea on Tuesday. An army official says Private Travis King has faced disciplinary action prior to the crossing and spent 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea. And this is a new image just into CNN, it shows the back of Travis King, that's him as you can see there in that black T-shirt and cap with his back to the camera.</p><p>He was with tourists on a tour of the demilitarized zone. Travis King was supposed to be on his way back to the United States, but let his guards and went to the tour of the DMZ, of course, is one of the most heavily- fortified areas in the world and separates North from South Korea. Our Will Ripley has a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We're still a bit of a distance from the DMZ, approaching what's known as the unification bridge. And you can see, even less than 5 miles out, you can still -- there's spike strips on the road, there's obviously all these barricades, basically they do not want people getting close to the Demilitarized Zone unless they're authorized to do so.</p><p>Now, tour groups, they're suspended for the time being, they were allowed in, but there's a lot of protocol, a lot of security checks that you have to go through. And -- but in fact, if indeed it was at Panmunjom, where this whole incident happened, then this young U.S. Army private, 23-year- old Travis King may have actually stepped across in relatively the same way the President Trump stepped across when he went with Kim Jong-un, which is just kind of -- we don't know if there's video that will ever be released that will show it.</p><p>Obviously, it was probably caught on multiple security cameras given the sensitivity of this location. But whether or not that will ever see the light of day, we don't know.</p><p>[14:10:00]</p><p>What we also don't know, Christina(ph), is exactly how long Mr. King is going to be in North Korean custody, pretty complicated situation considering the two sides have not had any official lines of communication for a very long time.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: That was Will Ripley there. So, what's next for Travis King; the American soldier detained in North Korea? Joining us from the Pentagon is CNN's Natasha Bertrand. And Natasha, we've heard, I believe from the State Department and from the White House, what is the White House saying? What's the very latest here?</p><p>NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, Isa, so the White House is essentially acknowledging that they still don't know where Travis King is and what condition he is in. But they are continuing to try to get in touch with the North Koreans to figure out how this issue can be resolved. Now, we did hear from U.S. military officials that they have reached out to their North Korean counterparts and the North Korean military.</p><p>But they have not yet received a response, and this is not unusual, given that throughout the entire Biden administration, the North Koreans have not responded to any kind of outreach from U.S. officials. So, this is going to be very challenging for the U.S. to try to resolve here in this very kind of bizarre case frankly. We're learning more about what exactly happened when Travis King was on this tour of the Demilitarized Zone.</p><p>He according to an eyewitness, all of a sudden just took off in a sprint and crossed the demarcation line, kind of running past everyone as soldiers on the South Korean side yelled at him to stop. And they yelled -- they yelled out, get him as they tried to stop him from crossing into the North Korean side. Of course, it was too late by that point, Travis King had already crossed over, and that was when he was detained by North Korean guards.</p><p>Now, Travis King was facing disciplinary charges in South Korea. He actually was in a detention facility for 50 days, just nearly two months after facing assault charges for allegedly assaulting members of the South Korean public, and he was set to be removed from the military altogether and return to the United States.</p><p>But just one day before he crossed that line over into North Korea, he was at the airport expected to board that plane back to the United States, and he actually never got on the flight. U.S. officials realized when he didn't show up at Fort Bliss, Texas, that something was awry here, and they've been trying to figure out how to get Travis King back ever since.</p><p>Obviously, his family is very concerned about him, and his mother spoke to \"ABC\", and she said that she can't imagine Travis doing something like this. And she'd only -- she had spoken to him only a few short days ago, and that -- and he said that he was heading back to Texas. But in the end, of course, all she wants is for him to come home, Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Natasha Bertrand there for us at the Pentagon, thanks very much, Natasha. Now, Israel's president is reassuring U.S. lawmakers that his country's democracy remains strong despite what he calls its imperfections. Isaac Herzog addressed both houses of Congress today, thanking the U.S. for its steadfast support, calling it Israel's greatest partner as well as friend.</p><p>Herzog is looking to smooth over tensions between U.S. and Israel's hard- line government headed by the leader with the real power, and that's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Herzog addressed concerns over the pushed overhaul and weaken Israel's judiciary, an ongoing effort threatening to tear Israel apart. Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ISAAC HERZOG, PRESIDENT, ISRAEL: The momentous debate in Israel is painful and deeply unnerving, because it highlights the cracks and the holes within the entire whole. And as president of Israel, I am here to tell the American people and each of you, that I have great confidence in Israeli democracy. Although, we are working through our issues, just like you, I know our democracy is strong and resilient. Israel has democracy in its DNA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: I want to bring in Kevin Liptak in Washington, who was listening to that. And Kevin, I think it's fair to say there is widespread support for Israel on both sides of the aisle in Congress. But some house Democrats skipped this address. Just tell us why?</p><p>KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, it was a handful, only about five or so of the most progressive Democrats in Congress, and what they were protesting was Israel's treatment of the Palestinians really. But more broadly, this idea of Israel backsliding in terms of democracy, and that is something that you hear from many Democrats, not just the ones who skipped the speech today, but real concerns about this proposed judicial overhauls that are underway in Israel now as well as expanding settlements in the West Bank.</p><p>And there is a real divide among Democrats about how to approach those issues with Israel, because certainly, most Democrats along with most Republicans are very supportive of Israel, and you saw that in the speech today. Real bipartisan support in terms of applause lines, in terms of support for the Israeli or President Herzog.</p><p>But there are concerns about the state of democracy in that country when it comes to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.</p><p>[14:15:00]</p><p>So the Islamickers(ph) who skipped the speech today, I think really trying to take a stand against what's happening on the ground there. Now, we should say it's not rare necessarily for lawmakers to boycott these speeches, and in fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke before Congress in 2015, 53 members of Congress boycotted that speech.</p><p>There are far fewer who boycotted today, but I do think it speaks to this challenge that Democrats find themselves in, and how to navigate this criticism of the Netanyahu government without necessarily criticizing Israel itself. Isa?</p><p>SOARES: Yes, and on the day of this address, of course, the \"New York Times\" had an interview, I'm not sure whether you saw this, Kevin, with President Biden --</p><p>LIPTAK: Sure --</p><p>SOARES: Conducted by Thomas Friedman, in which he said, I want to read part of it from Biden. \"Finding consensus on controversial areas of policy means taking the time you need for significant changes that's essential. So my recommendation to Israeli leaders is not to rush. I believe the best outcome is to continue to seek the broadest possible consensus here.\"</p><p>And then he went on to say after about an hour and 15 minutes of conversation, and Tom Friedman kind of put it together and to hit -- how he analyzes. He said he's basically pleading with Netanyahu and his supporters to understand. \"If we are not seen to share that democratic value, it will be difficult to sustain the special relationship that Israel and America have enjoyed for the last 75 years for another 75 years.\"</p><p>Was this last part of the message that we just heard there, was that conveyed to Netanyahu during that call between Netanyahu and Biden that they had on Monday?</p><p>LIPTAK: You know, I think it was. And what American officials are reading out of that call after it took place on Monday, they were clear that President Biden was very forthright with his Israeli counterpart, that democratic ideals are the underpinning of the U.S.-Israel relationship. And that degrading those ideals could have the potential of degrading the relationship overtime.</p><p>And it was interesting in that column, Thomas Friedman said that President Biden felt he couldn't be silent on this issue. So many things when it comes to Israel and the United States are so politically fraught, certainly, Republicans have been targeting President Biden for not necessarily supporting the Netanyahu government, quoting(ph) it with not supporting Israel in its security, in its regional issues.</p><p>And I think it's important that President Biden in this interview with Thomas Friedman made clear that while he supports Israel, he is a staunch supporter of Israel. He cannot support some of the issues that Netanyahu is talking about when it comes to this judicial overhaul. And certainly, no one in the United States wants their relationship to degrade. It's a very important Intelligence relationship, military relationship, in addition to the highly symbolic relationship with the world's only Jewish state.</p><p>And so, certainly, President Biden walking a very fine line in that interview and in public when it comes to talking about these issues, talking about Israel, and talking about Prime Minister in Benjamin Netanyahu, who he is expected to meet later this year, that will be a very important meeting for all of these issues to kind of come to ahead, Isa.</p><p>SOARES: Later this year, but no date yet, right? So, Kevin Liptak, appreciate it, thanks very much, Kevin.</p><p>LIPTAK: Sure.</p><p>SOARES: And still to come tonight, will we see a third indictment against Donald Trump? How a criminal case in Michigan plays into the former president's legal woes. We'll break it all down for you just after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:20:00]</p><p>SOARES: Well, for the first time, so-called fake electors are facing criminal charges for their alleged role, trying to overturn the 2020 U.S. election in favor of former President Donald Trump. Michigan's Attorney General has charged 16 people with a range of felonies including forgery as well as conspiracy. The charges come as Trump faces new legal troubles of his own.</p><p>His lawyers say they are appealing a judge's ruling in the E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse as well as defamation case. And they include the $5 million judgment against Trump and the judge denying him a new trial. This as the ex-president and current candidate, of course, says he is the target of special counsel Jack Smith's criminal probe.</p><p>And it covers the aftermath of the 2020 election and the January 6th, of course, insurrection as you can see right here. Trump has already been indicted over the mishandling of classified documents. He's been investigated for election interference in the state of Georgia, and don't forget, he is indicted in New York over hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels.</p><p>CNN's Tom Foreman has a look at the case in Michigan and how it could fit into the special counsel's probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Up in Michigan, state officials have now charged 16 people as false electors, posing as if they were the official electors from that state in the election. That fits in very well with the litany of accusations, suspicions that the special counsel has been scrutinizing. False electors, legislative nullification, pressure calls in at least seven different states.</p><p>Those calls to state officials, saying they should overturn the election in Trump's favor. What else did team Trump tried to do to overturn this election? Sixty court filings around the country, they lost all, but one, all but one. They lost virtually everything, but when the Supreme Court turned one down, Trump went online and again said the \"Supreme Court really let us down. No, wisdom. No courage.\"</p><p>What else did they try? There has been scrutiny of an Oval Office discussion from December of 2020, where there was allegedly talk about seizing voting machines, declaring martial law, anything rather than accept the fact that Trump actually lost the election. There was all that pressure on Vice President -- then Vice President Mike Pence to block certifications, something that we know legally, he could not do.</p><p>And of course, we all saw what happened on January 6th, when the then President Donald Trump rallied his supporters, told them to go to the Capitol, and said to them at one point, you need to fight like hell to defend your election here, what he called his victory in all of this. All of that we saw, all of that testifies to the fact that there was a concerted effort by team Trump in many places to try to overturn this legal, fair election that he lost.\"</p><p>And yet, Trump's response to all of this in the latest news is, \"I have a right to protest an election that I am fully convinced was rigged and stolen.\" Only question from many legal analyst here is, when did he go and did he go beyond merely protesting into something much more serious?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: That's Tom Foreman there. Let's get more analysis on this. I'm joined from Washington by National Security Attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, great to have you on this show. We have learned today that the letter that Trump received that he calls -- he said he was a target in the 2020 election probe, that he mentions three statutes from what I saw.</p><p>Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud the United States, deprivation of rights and tampering with the witness. Does this suggest to you that the special counsel is prosecuting a much bigger case here against Trump?</p><p>BRADLEY MOSS, NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY: It's a much more significant case, but not necessarily bigger, in the sense that a lot of people including the January 6th Committee have recommended -- made criminal referrals with respect to seditious conspiracy, with respect to insurrection.</p><p>[14:25:00]</p><p>There's no indication Jack Smith is going down that road, and I don't think he needs to. I think he has a very clean and direct case to make here just based off the media reporting that we have. Just based off the documentation and testimony that came out before the January 6th Committee. We know the efforts taken by Donald Trump to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, steps that were taken to -- Smith -- false electors to the National Archives and to Mike Pence.</p><p>Steps that were taken to subvert the Justice Department's role and try to have it put pressure on individual states to decertify their electoral college decisions. All those make for a very simple and straightforward case. The only question right now is how long can Donald Trump delay if he is indicted to try to push this off until after the election?</p><p>SOARES: And we'll talk about that in a moment because we've got different investigations ongoing, but in terms of an indictment here, Bradley, do you think that is -- a third indictment, do you think that's highly likely. How soon though could it come, you think?</p><p>MOSS: So, the grand jury on this matter will reconvene tomorrow, Thursday, so in theory, it could be as early as tomorrow, I believe they have one more witness they need to hear from at least. But in theory, that could certainly be the day that the government chooses to present for indictment, so we could have something tomorrow night.</p><p>It could be Friday or it could be next week, but given what we've seen, given the fact that a target letter was sent out with the notice to Donald Trump, you have four days to come before the grand jury. It certainly seems like it's any day now. I don't anticipate any reason to believe they'll go into August. It will be in July one way or the other.</p><p>SOARES: And in the target letter, was not the only sign of course that more accountability can be looming now, Tom Foreman that you just heard there put that all into perspective for us. We've also had Michigan's attorney general announcing multiple felony charges against 16 fake electors. What impact does that -- does this have, indictment have on these charges from Michigan or even vice versa here, Bradley?</p><p>MOSS: Well, the Michigan indictment, and don't forget there's also still a matter going down in Georgia with Fani Willis in Fulton County, and there's a separate investigation in Arizona. These -- the Michigan indictment goes after the local officials, the people who corrupted the local state process because in the end, in the United States, our elections, even national elections for a president, all handled at the local level.</p><p>It's handled by state authorities, under state laws, and they present those votes to the electoral college and decide who will be the next president. So, having local authorities bring these charges against these local officials under the applicable state law is very necessary step of legal accountability. And it kind of takes that burden off the feds, and particularly off Jack Smith, to bring federal charges where it's more than, you know, easily handled by the state law enforcement authorities against those individuals.</p><p>And just as we were coming on air, you know, you guys were talking about the Manhattan hush money case. Federal judge just remanded that back to state court and rejected Donald Trump's arguments, trying to keep that in federal court.</p><p>SOARES: I mean, so -- I mean what we've just outlined there in the last few minutes with you, Bradley, is that we could really be looking at a legal logjam here. How then do you schedule multiple trials and give Trump a fair trial without slowing down, let's say, the wheels of justice here?</p><p>MOSS: Yes, that is going to be a master class in scheduling, because it's not going to be easy. Even if Donald Trump wasn't heading for president, and he is, and he's got to, you know, compete in these various primaries just to get the nomination. We know he's got the Manhattan hush money case. We know he's got a civil case against the New York State Attorney General.</p><p>He's got the defamation case with E. Jean Carroll. He's got the Mar-a-Lago documents case, and now he's going to likely have this one. It is going to be an extremely difficult year or so for him of legal scheduling. His only goal right now, his top priority is to delay the federal cases in particular as long as humanly possible. And trying to push everything off until after the election in the hope that he could pardon himself on a federal charges, and possibly, get some stay of punishment on any state charges for which he's convicted.</p><p>SOARES: But what's the legal argument for delaying then, Bradley?</p><p>MOSS: Part of it simply going to be scheduling. That there is different cases going on, that the different courts have to handle their own dockets and he can't be in two places at once. Part of it will be the (INAUDIBLE) where he's required to be as opposed to where it's only optional, so, it certainly gives the courts some more flexibility.</p><p>He will likely won't be president at the civil trials in New York with E. Jean Carroll and New York Attorney General regarding his corporation. He won't be present for most of the criminal proceedings, but he has to be there if there's a trial. So they're going to have to schedule these various different actual trials for periods of time that don't overlap with the other cases. And so, for the next 12 to 16 months, it's going to be which trial is he in now? Which trial is he in coming up next?</p><p>[14:30:05]</p><p>SOARES:Bradley Moss, we appreciate your analysis. Thank you, Bradley.</p><p>And still to come tonight, wildfires rage across southern Europe where temperatures, they're expected to rise. We will have the very latest on the intense heat just ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back, everyone.</p><p>Europe is grappling with intense heat that continues to wreak havoc; 17 European nations are currently under high temperature alert with southern Europe being hit the hardest. Crews in Greece are backing wildfires with the third day in a row and there could be no end in sight. Temperatures are expected to rise later in the week.</p><p>Switzerland is also dealing with a new forest fire which broke out on Tuesday. Officials say the fire danger there is likely to rise over the next 48 hours. A very concerning picture indeed.</p><p>Well in France, nine regions are now under in orange warning for intense heat on Thursday. Let's get more from Richard Quest who is in Nice for work. He is in the south of France.</p><p>And, Richard, if you are still with us, can you hear me?</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): Do we have Richard?</p><p>We are trying to get Richard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): Fantastic.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST: Yes, go ahead, how can I help?</p><p>SOARES: Orange warning, how hot are we talking about here?</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>[14:35:00]</p><p>QUEST: Just bear with me one second, Isa. As you can imagine, there are all sorts of technical problems that cause on this sort of night. It is actually quite hot, here it's 81 degrees in the moment, 29 degrees Celsius.</p><p>And across southern France, along with the rest of Europe, it is the heat, it's the humidity that is simply unbelievable in many cases. I have been filming here along the Cote d'Azur for the last five days. And people are exhausted, people wondering just what is happening, how hot is it going to be?</p><p>I mean I have seen stories about Americans making jokes about Europeans not drinking water. I can tell you everywhere that I am here, people are drinking vast amounts of water, myself included.</p><p>Ultimately, you can hear, Isa, what happens. Ultimately, my voice is gone. Ultimately the sheer into air conditioning, out into the heat, backwards and forward, it is really taking its toll.</p><p>Now the interesting question is whether or not people believe it is climate change.</p><p>Or are they just happy to be having a very nice summer holiday?</p><p>SOARES: Yes. I will let you rest your voice because I know you are anchoring \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" in about 20 minutes or so. Richard Quest for us there, thank you very much, Richard.</p><p>Blame the heat for those technical gremlins.</p><p>Now the Middle East is facing dangerous levels of heat too. The heat index, that's what the temperature feels like to the human body, hit 152 degrees Fahrenheit in the Persian Gulf on Sunday. That is roughly 67 degrees Celsius.</p><p>To put that into perspective, a heat index of 160 degrees Fahrenheit is widely considered the upper threshold of what people can endure for any more than a few hours.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>[14:40:00]</p><p>SOARES: And still to come tonight, why the world's most vulnerable people may pay the price, now that a grain deal between Russia and Ukraine has been terminated. This story after the short break.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is accusing Russia of deliberately attacking sites used to export grain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): These grain terminals were hit in the southern city of Odessa. Earlier today, the Russian defense ministry announced all ships sailing in the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports will be considered potential carriers of military cargo beginning Thursday.</p><p>According to that ministry, countries whose national flags fly on these ships will be considered part of the Ukrainian conflict back in Kyiv. All of this coming just days after the Kremlin pulled out of a deal that allowed Ukraine to safely export its grain from Odessa's port.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: For more on what is at stake, for millions of people in developing countries who rely on this grain, I want to turn to David Harland, the executive director of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue. For more than 20, years his U.N.-backed organization has helped secure peace agreements and reduced human suffering caused by war.</p><p>David, great to have you on the show. We appreciate your time this evening. You have helped broker, I, believe the initial talks that led to the grain deal.</p><p>Where are we right now in trying to get Russia back on board?</p><p>DAVID HARLAND, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTRE FOR HUMANITARIAN DIALOGUE: Well, it's good to be with you, Eva (sic). No, it's going to be very hard to get back Russia into the agreement. They've gone very far now.</p><p>I, mean today, you presumably have been reporting that maybe 60,000 tons of grain storage in Ukraine has been targeted by Russian missiles. So that was cargo destined for China.</p><p>[14:45:00]</p><p>HARLAND: So Russia has taken a fairly dramatic action. You have reported on the announcement they made, that they will treat as hostile any vessels moving across the Black Sea toward Ukraine's ports. That is essentially a threat to sink them. So it will be very hard at this point to get Russia back.</p><p>SOARES: And President Putin has said, David, Russia would return to the table if its demands are met. Explain to our viewers what Putin wants.</p><p>What are the demands?</p><p>HARLAND: Right, so the structure of the deal that we originally proposed was that Ukraine would be allowed to export its grain, which is essential for keeping world food prices, down particularly in the poorest countries.</p><p>And in return, which would also help alleviate global hunger, the United Nations would help Russia with its own agricultural exports. But Russia is unhappy with how much has been done on that account.</p><p>Actually, Russia's grain exports are not sanctioned. So it's mainly a dispute about the financial arrangements, about the banking systems that undergird the trade. And Russia is not happy with those. And so it has pulled out.</p><p>SOARES: I wonder, what, then is left in terms of options?</p><p>Apologies to say, this but you sound pessimistic that we can actually bring Russia on board.</p><p>What other options there are?</p><p>I spoke to the president of the Ukrainian Grain Association. I spoke to him on Monday. Have a listen, David, to what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKOLAY GORBACHOV, PRESIDENT, UKRAINIAN GRAIN ASSOCIATION: Of course, I am sure that Ukraine can export grain without Russia. I absolutely agree with the President Zelenskyy.</p><p>But for this, we need international support and on this support can be like a Turkish fleet or international insurance, for example, from Lloyd's or guarantee from Ukrainian army.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Do you think shipments can continue if Turkiye's on board?</p><p>If others are on board?</p><p>Or do we need Russia also to be on board?</p><p>HARLAND: No, no. They --</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>SOARES: Unfortunately we seem to have lost his signal, he is breaking. Up</p><p>Oh, have we got you, now David?</p><p>Apologies, we missed the beginning of the sentence. You said no, it's not impossible. Go ahead.</p><p>HARLAND: No, it is not possible for Ukraine to export grain across the Black Sea without Russian consent. Russia has to agree because Russia controls the -- militarily the whole northern part of the Black Sea. So I think it has to involve Russia.</p><p>But at this point, Russia is not cooperating. And in my view, if there is going to be a new deal, Russia has done so much now to speak out against the agreement and to deny. It now that any new deal will have to be of a different nature.</p><p>SOARES: So what kind of nature?</p><p>What are we looking at in terms of a deal then?</p><p>Because you don't sound very optimistic, David.</p><p>HARLAND: No, I'm not at all optimistic. Having been involved in this from the very beginning, I think this is the worst moment. And I think -- my sense is that it will have to be smaller and bigger.</p><p>I think there are a group of African presidents going to Russia quite soon. And Putin is scheduled to go and see President Erdogan in Turkiye quite soon. And I think there will be a lot of pressure on him.</p><p>But I think, given how far they have gone, they will probably find it hard to walk back. So they will probably only agree to humanitarian shipments. I think the World Food Programme could step in, I think if Russia would agree to, that so that at least the world's most needy people in the world's most --</p><p>[14:50:00]</p><p>HARLAND: -- food-short countries would get supplies from Ukraine, which is such a big contributor to the grain market.</p><p>But I don't think that the big deal, which is the one where -- which is pushing down global food prices, is going to change. As you know, global food prices, global grain prices, wheat futures in the Chicago commodities market rose 8 percent. Today 8 percent inflation in one day.</p><p>So I doubt we're going to get back there. I think next time there will be a big deal. It will probably be in the context of the deal that ends the war.</p><p>SOARES: David Harland, we appreciate you taking the time. Important context. Thank, you David.</p><p>We'll be back after the short break.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SOARES: This just in to CNN.

Unrest earlier, police fired tear gas and dozens of protesters tossed rocks and set fires in the streets of Nairobi.</p><p>As the first of three days of planned demonstrations got underway, opposition leaders have called on Kenyans to make their voices heard, as anger grows over a slew of unpopular tax hikes that threaten to worsen the economic strain already facing many in the country.</p><p>Despite a court order to temporarily halt the hikes, the government went ahead and increased a levy on petroleum products, causing a jump in fuel prices. In the meantime, U.N. said it's very concerned about the widespread use of violence by security forces after 23 demonstrators were reportedly killed in recent protests. CNN will have a live report from Nairobi in the next hour on \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.\"</p><p>Turning into a very different story, now police in the U.S. state of Nevada say they've carried out a search warrant in connection with a decades-old murder case that has rocked the music business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): Tupac Shakur was on top of the rap world when he was murdered back in 1996. His killing has remained unsolved.</p><p>[14:55:00]</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): And prompted massive speculation ever since. Now Las Vegas Metropolitan Police confirmed to CNN that they executed the warrant in the city of Henderson on Tuesday. No word on what they were looking for or what they may have found.

It takes him between 50 to 800 hours to make each sculpture, painstakingly adding each piece to make creations more dynamic.</p><p>They are pretty stunning. And creating these Lego sculptures are the building blocks of his life and Nimako says this.</p><p>\"This is fine art. It's not a hobby. It's not a toy. It's not part of the Lego fandom. It is not goofy.\"</p><p>They are pretty beautiful.</p><p>That does it for us this evening. Thank you very much for your. Time to stay right, here Richard Quest is up next.

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert (R-California) (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), center.

And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) (Senate photo) <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/>The post Pentagon to halt use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS as cleanup

More than 16,000 people have fled blazes in southwestern France, where several regions were on high alert[7] for potentially record temperatures on Monday. About 3,200 residents were evacuated from Spain's Mijas hills, though some have since returned, per the BBC[8], which notes over 1,000 heat-related deaths have been recorded in Spain and fire-ravaged Portugal in recent days. What to watch: Though officials say the fires in Portugal[9] have been contained, they warn the risk remains high after temperatures of up to 108F were forecast for this week, per the Guardian[10]. </p><p><br/>Meanwhile, British farmers have expressed concern[11] about the threat of crop fires after the U.K. Met Office issued its first-ever Red warning[12] for extreme heat\u2014predicting there's an 80% chance the national temperature record of 101.66F (38.7C) will be beaten by Wednesday.

Fortunately, in Central Oregon, many of these types of trails exist. Several can be found from the ever-popular Phil's Trailhead, from Shevlin Park and from the Deschutes River Trail.<br/>But in late summer and early fall, the high country is accessible, and the Tumalo Creek Trail gives riders a chance for a relatively nontechnical ride at the upper reaches of the eastern slope of the Cascade Range.<br/>I made the 10-mile drive west of Bend to Skyliner Sno-park a few weeks ago with a friend who is new to mountain biking, leaving the smoke-filled air of Bend for clear skies at the edge of the mountains.<br/>The start of the Tumalo Creek Trail is a little tricky, with some tree roots jutting up from the ground, followed by a brief climb. After that, it's pretty much smooth sailing, other than a couple of rocky sections that can be a challenge for a beginner.<br/>We took our time and dismounted to walk in places that were a bit too technical or steep for my friend. But those areas were few.<br/>The Tumalo Creek trail follows the creek about 3.5 miles to Tumalo Falls, an iconic Central Oregon attraction and a nice visual reward for completing the first half of the ride.<br/>As we rode, we caught glimpses of the babbling creek below, and of Mount Bachelor and the rugged green surroundings of Tumalo Canyon and the Bridge Creek Burn, a 1979 forest fire that completely changed the landscape of the area.<br/>After enjoying views of the falls, we headed back the way we had come. On the ride back to Skyliner Sno-park, bikers can gain significant speed on the smooth trail, but keeping a watchful eye for hikers and trail runners is a must, as the trail is quite popular.<br/>We completed the 7-mile out-and-back ride in a little more than an hour.<br/>Aside from an out-and-back journey, the Tumalo Creek Trail can be part of longer rides that loop up into the upper elevations of the Central Oregon Cascades.<br/>Later, on Aug. 29, I started from Skyliner Sno-park and rode the Tumalo Ridge, Swede Ridge and South Fork trails before completing the 13-mile loop on the Tumalo Creek Trail.<br/>Many other longer, more advanced loop rides in the high country of the Deschutes National Forest emanate from Skyliner Sno-park and Tumalo Falls. One such ride, the North Fork-Flagline loop, is a 20-mile classic through alpine meadows and along the edge of Broken Top, with grueling climbs and fast descents.<br/>Also, from Skyliner Sno-park, mountain bikers can connect to the Skyliners Trail, which links up to the Whoops Trail, Sector 16 and other trails in the Phil's network.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-7935539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SN-K4B1-JBSN-02FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Columbian Publishing Co.

Olive trees, too. As their insides burn, they let out a cry. At that point, it's almost impossible to put the fire out. </p><p><br/> This year, the smoke appeared above the ridges around Mazikoy on July 31. When the residents of the cove\u2014many of them employees and owners of small hotels\u2014saw it, they knew how quickly the dried-out pine trees buffeting the cove, baked by a record-breaking heat wave, would burn. They evacuated all their guests in the middle of the night. <br/> 'No one had any idea what was going to happen,' Cagri Tas, whose family owns the Incekum guest house in Mazikoy, told me when I visited. <br/> Summer vacationers lined up on the cove's only dock, waiting for rescue boats sent by the coast guard. Around 3 a.m., they piled onto these boats with their luggage and pets\u2014'Like Noah's ark,' Tas said\u2014and were taken to the nearby city of Bodrum. Locals stayed behind. <br/> Helicopters momentarily brought the fires under control around dawn. But 9 a.m. on Aug. 1, the blaze surrounded the town on all sides. <br/> As flames swept across the single road leading to the cove, firefighters were unable to reach the restaurants and hotels lining the beach. With electricity and water shut off, hotel owners and their families shuttled water from the sea to the flames in buckets. With the exception of eight men, who stayed behind to fight the fire, the people of Mazikoy boarded boats at 11 a.m. and headed out into the bay. Behind them, they watched flames encroach on their homes and livelihoods, the sky burnt orange and choked with smoke. <br/> When the Tas family returned to Mazikoy on Aug. 2, the hills behind their hotel were black. So was the sea, the beach lined with ashes. The family's property was intact, but other hotels in the cove were not so lucky. <br/> While the local government came to clean up the remains of the burned buildings later that week, the villagers heard little from the national government beyond a condolence visit from the interior minister, Suleyman Soylu. They were left to wonder: Where had help been when they needed it? And how had these fires been allowed to cause such devastation in the first place? <br/> The hills behind behind Mazikoy, Turkey, are seen blackened by forest fires on Aug. 6. Erin O'Brien for Foreign Policy  <br/><br/>The Turkish government's relief efforts for this summer's forest fires in the country's southern regions have been widely condemned as insufficient. Without an immediate, aggressive statewide response\u2014and with temperatures climbing over 104 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014the fires were able to burn more than 150,000 hectares[1] of forest over the course of just two weeks, killing eight people[2]. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) have attempted to politicize the disaster, blaming the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey and the United States consider a terrorist group, for sabotage and local municipalities for their lack of response. The government also criminalized a social media campaign\u2014#HelpTurkey\u2014that aimed to raise money for the areas affected, with prosecutors investigating posts using the hashtag. Erdogan and his supporters argued that the campaign aimed to make the government look weak, and they started a rival campaign\u2014#StrongTurkey\u2014that lauded the federal response to the fires. <br/>Turkey's coastal regions primarily vote for the opposition Republican People's Party. In the four weeks since the fires there, floods in the Black Sea region, in the country's north, have killed at least 82 people[3] and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses. In contrast, that area\u2014which is Erdogan's ancestral home turf and resoundingly supported the People's Alliance between the AKP and the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party in the 2019 local elections\u2014earned immediate pledges of support from government agencies, with Erdogan even announcing a fundraising campaign. The divergent responses to these two crises have only emphasized the political and strategic nature of the AKP's relationship to environmental disaster. <br/> Over the course of its tenure at Turkey's helm, the AKP has prioritized development, urbanization, and capital gain over environmental conservation. Since Turkey's founding in 1923, successive governments have positioned development and industrialization as state-building[4], but the trend that has only accelerated since Erdogan took power nearly two decades ago. <br/><br/> Since the 2013 Gezi Park protests, the AKP has treated environmental activism as inherently anti-government. The protests, which were sparked by government plans to transform a green space in Istanbul's center into a shopping mall, ballooned into large-scale anti-government demonstrations when demonstrators were met with extreme police violence. The Gezi Park protests, which lasted over a month, are seen as an inflection point in the AKP's anti-democratic turn. Now, despite the stringent protections for forests and natural areas enshrined in Turkish law, the ethos of economic development and the politicization of environmental issues mean Turkey is unable to effectively combat environmental degradation and climate change. <br/> When the religious-conservative AKP came to power in 2002, it did so on a platform that emphasized development and industrialization. For the first decade of the party's tenure, this strategy worked. Turkey's GDP per capita skyrocketed from just over $3,600 in 2002 to a peak of over $12,600 in 2013, though it has fallen steadily since. Many of the government's flagship development projects, however, have come at an enormous environmental cost. <br/> The Ilisu Dam project, for example, has submerged the ancient city of Hasankeyf, near the Syrian border. The transformation of Lake Salda, once a protected habitat, into a public recreation area has led to its rapid degradation. Urbanization in Istanbul and its environs, combined with poor enforcement of regulations of industrial waste, has caused the Sea of Marmara to be choked with sea snot[5]. The government's proposed KanalIstanbul project[6] could, according to experts, lead to the devastation of natural habitats on its planned path, destroying ecosystems in both the Marmara and Black seas. And the Kemerkoy Thermal Power Plant, which has been allowed to operate for nearly 30 years despite local court orders and widespread protest, has wreaked havoc on Gokova Bay, a protected habitat. On Jan. 1, 2020, the plant was ordered to close as a result of new environmental regulations passed in parliament. But shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization granted it a 'temporary operation document' that allowed the plant to continue operations despite its noncompliance. <br/> As it happens, the plant is located in Turkevleri, another Aegean locality that suffered during this summer's blaze. Firefighters were able to bring the fire under control just before it reached the silo, from which plant workers had removed all flammable material. Had they not, a bomb of noxious gases would have been waiting to explode. <br/> A forest destroyed by fire outside of Icmeler, near Marmaris, Turkey, on Aug. 5. Erin O'Brien for Foreign Policy  <br/><br/>According to Global Forest Watch, Turkey's tree cover shrunk[7] by 545,000 hectares from 2001 to 2020, a 5.4 percent decrease since 2000. So far this year, approximately 175,000 hectares of forest have burned, according[8] to the European Forest Fire Information system, more than eight times the amount of land that has usually burned by this point in the year. The forces meant to protect these forests have also been hobbled. At the height of the fires, Turkey's fleet of approximately 12 firefighting planes was grounded due lack of maintenance. Many firefighting pilots have been fired in recent years, and the Turkish Aeronautical Association, which should have overseen the air response, is led by an AKP appointee who was unreachable when the fires were at their worst. (He later said in an interview[9] that he was at a wedding.) <br/><br/>Article 169 of the Turkish Constitution states that in the case of forest fire, 'Burnt forest areas shall be reafforested' and 'other agricultural and stockbreeding activities shall not be allowed in such areas.' Forest protection has long been codified in Turkish law: The first forest protection legislation was passed in 1839, as part of the Ottoman Tanzimat reforms. After the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the first Forest Law was passed in 1937, and its modern manifestation was passed in 1956. In 1982, forestry laws were incorporated into the post-military-coup constitution, which is still in force today. In all of these laws[10], a healthy forest is defined by the number of trees and replanting efforts it houses\u2014not its biodiversity. In the aftermath of the most recent fires, Erdogan himself stated that trees would be replanted in devastated areas. <br/> 'According to the constitution, burned areas cannot be used for other purposes, they are reforested,' he said on July 31. 'As a government that has increased the presence of Turkey's forests, it is our foremost duty to reforest everywhere that has burned.' <br/> The problem is that, once those trees are planted, there is very little regulation or willingness to curb development in affected areas. The government can grant permission for formerly burned land to be developed for a variety of sanctioned purposes, including tourism. This ability was strengthened by a law passed by the Turkish parliament[11] as fires were burning\u2014on July 28\u2014that signed over control of forested areas and coastlines to the tourism ministry. Many fear that the government and the state-controlled housing authority, known as TOKI\u2014the mechanism behind much of Turkey's rapid development\u2014will use the land already cleared by the fires for large-scale projects, such as luxury hotels and resorts. <br/> The burned ruins of the Kale Pansiyon restaurant in Mazikoy on Aug. 7.  <br/> The ruins of Rota Pansiyon in Mazikoy on Aug. 7. Erin O'Brien for Foreign Policy  <br/><br/> This fear is borne out by history. In July 2007, a forest fire broke out[12] in the region of Guvercinlik, near the resort city of Bodrum. By the time the fire was brought under control, over 250 hectares of forest and over 20 hectares of fields and olive groves were burned. After the fire, the head of forestry in the surrounding province of Mugla, former AKP federal legislator Ibrahim Aydin, insisted that despite popular claims, the burned area would not be developed. <br/> But construction of three luxury hotels in the region began soon thereafter. La Blanche Island hotel opened in 2012, five years after the fire, followed by Titanic Deluxe Bodrum and Lujo Bodrum Hotel in 2016 and 2018, respectively. <br/> On July 29, a wildfire in the Guvercinlik district of Bodrum once again threatened the area where the three hotels now stand, and over 3,000 tourists were evacuated to the sea. Though the hotels did not sustain significant damage, according to the manager of Titanic Hotels group, the hills behind the three resorts were again reduced to ash. <br/> Two days later, TOKI shared[13] a 3D model of a home on social media. The administration, TOKI wrote, had 'mobilized to wipe out the effects of the fire' and would rehouse 'our citizens' in their 'new homes,' designed to evoke traditional regional architecture, within one year. <br/> There is one catch, though: Residents will have to pay off the cost of these homes to TOKI over 20 years. The economy in the region\u2014especially in smaller towns like Mazikoy\u2014is largely dependent on tourism and the production of olives and honey. Regional tourism took an enormous hit during the coronavirus pandemic and has been all but destroyed by the fires. Some of the hotel owners I spoke to in Mazikoy have seen all their bookings through September canceled. With no promise of tourism revenue, and with olive trees and beehives burned, there is no assurance that families who have lost their homes will actually have the means to pay to replace them. <br/> AKP representatives, however, have hailed the coming TOKI projects as a success. On Aug. 2, Mehmet Ozeren, the AKP mayor of Gundogmus, in Antalya province, said in an interview that citizens should be pleased. His response encapsulates the AKP's general attitude toward the environment: a focus on reconstructing and developing after environmental disaster rather than addressing its root causes. <br/> 'Our citizens whose houses have become unstable will have houses built by TOKI to their preferences, paid over 20 years with low interest rates,' Ozeren said, 'I think that citizens with very old houses will say, 'I wish that our house had burned down too.'' <br/> [ 1]: <url

(Photo by Senior Airman Andrew Bertain/U.S. Space Force) <br/>WASHINGTON \u2014 Battered by years of criticism from U.S. lawmakers and environmental advocates, the Department of Defense will stop purchasing PFAS-containing firefighting foam later this year and phase it out entirely in 2024. </p><p><br/>Alaska lakes' levels of 'forever chemicals' revealed as officials ponder actions to reduce risks[1] The replacement for Aqueous Film Forming Foam has yet to be determined, and advocates are frustrated it's taken so long to halt the use of a product containing a 'forever chemical' that at high levels of exposure may lead to increased risks for cancer,[2] among other effects. The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. <br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [3]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[4] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[5] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[6] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[7], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[8]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [9]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[2]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[10] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[11] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[12] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[13] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[14] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[15] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[16] and Minnesota[17] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[18] and Senate[19] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><url

Flames were about a mile from the famous Giant Forest, a grove of some 2,000 massive sequoias on a plateau high in the Sierra Nevada.<br/>\"It's been slow growth,\" fire information officer Katy Hooper said.<br/>Lower temperatures and a layer of smoke blanketing the area have been suppressing the flames.<br/>Firefighters have placed a special aluminum wrapping around the base of the General Sherman Tree, the world's largest by volume at 52,508 cubic feet, as well as some other trees and buildings.<br/>The material can withstand intensive heat for short periods and has been used in national parks and forests for several years throughout the West to protect sensitive structures from flames.<br/>A major element of the grove's defense is decades of prescribed burns - fires intentionally set to clear the forest floor of vegetation that could feed bigger blazes - and thinning projects to remove small trees that could become ladders carrying fire up to the crowns of the giants.<br/>A fire in the region last year killed thousands of sequoias, which grow as tall as high-rises at certain elevations on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.<br/>\"This is a beautiful, open, park-like forest,\" fire spokesman Mark Garrett said.<br/>But a historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight.<br/>Lightning ignited two fires in the park on Sept. 9, officials said. The Colony Fire, closest to the Giant Forest, has grown to just under 5 square miles. The Paradise Fire has scorched nearly 13 square miles.<br/>More than 400 firefighters were assigned to the blazes, which are being collectively managed as the KNP Complex. More resources have been requested, Hooper said.<br/>To the south, the Windy Fire grew to nearly 11 square miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into one grove of sequoias and threatens others. Difficult terrain has prevented officials from assessing damage to the big trees.<br/>Sequoia National Park is the second natural jewel to be threatened by wildfires in less than a month.<br/>Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake perched high in the mountains on the California-Nevada line, was threatened by the explosive Caldor Fire until firefighters stopped its march.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-7931953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SN-K4B1-JBSN-01XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Columbian Publishing Co.

U.S. District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz also ordered Williams to join the others in collectively paying restitution to the city of Minneapolis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The total: $12 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four men will have a difficult time making progress on that tab over the next couple years as they serve out their prison terms. If they are lucky enough to get jobs through the Federal Prison Industries, they will earn between 23 cents and $1.15 per hour.</p><p>So how will they ever pay off the full amount?</p><p>They probably won't.</p><p>\"I doubt that the judge expects that any one of these defendants has $12 million lying around,\" said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.</p><p>The eight-figure penalty represents a common gap in criminal sentencing throughout America's federal court system: The restitution bill far exceeds the defendants' financial means. Those convicted of the crime pay incremental sums, and the money never comes close to meeting restitution's purpose of returning victims back to their status quo. In reality, the U.S. Department of Justice recovers only $1 out of every $10 owed per year, making restitution sometimes symbolic or a mere formality in a criminal sentence, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.</p><p>The tab for the police station fire isn't so uncommon.</p><p>In Oregon, a judge ordered a teenage boy who started a forest fire with fireworks to pay $36.6 million in 2018.</p><p>A California judge ordered a homeless man to pay $101 million, also for a forest fire, in 2008.</p><p>A New York judge ordered Bernie Madoff to pay $170 billion for engineering the nation's most destructive financial fraud scheme.</p><p>Today, judges are often required by law to award restitution, but that wasn't always the case. In the early 20th century, judges applied restitution to probation as a form of restorative justice designed to make the victims whole again. In the 1990s, Congress passed a pair of laws that made restitution mandatory for many violent and sexual abuse crimes - including for cases like the Third Precinct arson.</p><p>That legislation has led to the staggering restitution tabs accompanying prison sentences.</p><p>Even though a person will likely never fully pay, these high-priced restitutions may serve to force the defendant to come to grips with the harm they caused, said Steve Schleicher, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Minnesota who helped secure a murder conviction for former officer Derek Chauvin, who killed George Floyd.</p><p>\"I think there is value in stating the number and confronting the defendant with the actual dollar-amount damage,\" said Schleicher, now a law partner at Maslon LLP. \" 'This is the amount of damage you caused, and in fact you're responsible for it.' \"</p><p>The sticker shock may cause someone else to think twice before committing a similar crime, Schleicher said.</p><p>It's also not impossible that those convicted will one day come into a windfall. If they do end up inheriting wealth, winning the lottery or selling the rights to their life stories, prosecutors want to make sure that money goes toward the victims, said Osler.</p><p>\"It's rare,\" he said, \"but stuff happens.\"</p><p>Restitution as life sentence</p><p>In the Third Precinct arson case, the city of Minneapolis came up with the $12 million by estimating the costs of rebuilding, plus equipment, cleanup and overtime pay for city employees in the aftermath of the fires.</p><p>Williams, Davon De-Andre Turner, Dylan Shakespeare Robinson and Branden Michael Wolfe have all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson.</p><p>If they do find employment in the federal prison's UNICOR industry jobs, they will pay half their wages toward restitution. If they don't, they still pay $25 every three months. Once out on supervised release, they will start contributing small amounts - $50 to $100 per month - toward restitution. After the sentences are served, the Department of Justice takes over the collection of restitution payments from defendants.</p><p>Some who study criminal justice say high restitution sentences like this one place an unfair burden on defendants, sending them into an endless cycle of debt after release from prison.</p><p>\"That can make it very, very hard for people to ever recover in their lives down the road,\" said Sandra Guerra Thompson, director of the Criminal Justice Institute at the University of Houston Law Center. \"In some ways, it can be more devastating than a prison sentence.\"</p><p>Finding a job with a livable wage is crucial to staying crime-free after prison. But formerly incarcerated people are unemployed at rates five times higher than the general population, according to an analysis from nonpartisan think tank Prison Policy Initiative.</p><p>Those who do find jobs earn 52% less on average, entrenching them in poverty that may perpetuate the cycle of crime, according to a 2020 report from New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice.</p><p>Restitution can't be discharged by bankruptcy. A multimillion dollar restitution contributes to what could turn into a financial hole from which there is no escape, said Brad Colbert, a law professor who runs a legal assistance clinic for prisoners at Mitchell-Hamline law school.</p><p>\"This is the equivalent of sentencing somebody to 600 years in prison,\" said Colbert. \"This will follow them for the rest of their lives.\"</p><p>Colbert said he doesn't oppose restitution, but he believes the sentence should account for a person's ability to pay.</p><p>\"Essentially, this becomes a judgment, and they collect on it forever,\" he said. \"And it's not clear to me what the point of that is.\"</p><p>'Have mercy'</p><p>Yet the law often gives no discretion for judges and prosecutors to waive high restitutions, said Ian Birrell, a defense attorney who represented Williams.</p><p>In conspiracy cases, all defendants are required to shoulder the cost, even those who played a minor role in the crime.</p><p>In Williams' case, prosecutors say an estimated 1,000 people had gathered outside the police station that night, and many illegally entered the building. But only four have been so far convicted of helping burn it down.</p><p>Williams pleaded guilty to lighting a Molotov cocktail, which Turner used to ignite a fire. Williams also threw a box on top of a fire near the entrance of the precinct.</p><p>In court, Birrell asked that Williams be ordered to pay only $12,000, arguing that sum would be proportionate to his client's role in the damage.</p><p>\"Please have mercy on me while you sentence me,\" Williams asked the judge.</p><p>Schiltz called Williams a \"good person who made a terrible mistake.\" He gave the 27-year-old a shorter prison sentence than the other men. But Schiltz said he is required by law to order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses, without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.</p><p>Williams must begin making payments after he enters prison next month.</p><p>Andy Mannix \u00b7 612-673-4036</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN63038483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62YY-GB91-DYRH-917P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1212\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 20, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009MW2</classCode><className>FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004PCN</classCode><className>UNIVERSITY OF ST THOMAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC2731 BOOKS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. That includes almost two dozen locations in Maryland, including sites at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Fort Detrick, Fort Meade, Joint Base Andrews, Martin State Air National Guard Base, and 11 naval installations. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/>Decades of warnings <br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/>Effective at extinguishing fires <br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/>Contamination near military bases <br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/>'Early phases' of investigation <br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/>Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on Tuesday proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/>Alternative firefighting foam <br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[13]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii and Maryland[15] banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[16]andMinnesota[17]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>Inspired by the Death of a Veteran Firefighter, Bill Would Limit Exposure to Toxic Chemical in Fire Foam and Gear[18] <br/>'Inspired by the Death of a Veteran Firefighter, Bill Would Limit Exposure to Toxic Chemical in Fire Foam and Gear' \u2014 Maryland Matters[19] <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[20]andSenate[21]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/>Danielle E.

The competition focused on using drone technology to help first responders during critical, life-saving missions, like during a forest fire, for example. Teams were judged on longest flight duration and other categories, like overall design and least expensive drone.</p><p>Penn State placed third place in the longest flight duration category, receiving $20,000. The team also earned the first responders' choice award and an award for drone autonomy, both worth $5,000. The team plans to use the money for future competition expenses.</p><p>The Autonomous Robotics Competition Club (ARCC), co-founded by Vidullan Surendran, a doctoral candidate in aerospace engineering, was created for students in relevant fields of study to participate in autonomous-vehicle competitions like this one around the country.</p><p>\"We use our own graduate research on robotics, artificial intelligence, sensor fusion and control theory to create UAV software that really works, and is competitive,\" said Surendran, ARCC president. \"We use common computer programming languages and open-source software that is accessible to everyone to develop our drone software.\"</p><p>Competitions like the First Responder UAS Endurance Challenge usually involve several stages. These include designing the drone in simulation and submitting a report, building the structure and electronics hardware, designing the autonomous software and testing the drone. On the final day, the team travels to the indoor or outdoor contest venue to set it up before going head-to-head with other teams.</p><p>After ARCC succeeded in three preliminary competition stages, Endurance Challenge organizers sent a video team to the Mid-State Regional Airport in Phillipsburg to record ARCC's drone flight. The autonomous UAV stayed above ground for over an hour while carrying a 10-pound load which scored third in duration behind industry groups Advanced Aircraft Company and Intelligent Energy.</p><p>\"Competitions like this allow us to take what we learn in class and in our research and apply it,\" Surendran said. \"Our club members teach each other to put into practice what we learn in class. But it's important for engineers, especially aerospace engineers, to learn how to build and fly UAVs. All of us use the competitions as motivation to learn more.\"</p><p>In addition to Surendran, participants in the First Responder UAS Endurance Challenge were Rachel Axten, Venkatakrishnan Iyer and Vitor Valente, all doctoral students in aerospace engineering. ARCC is sponsored by the University Park Allocation Committee and the Department of Aerospace Engineering. Eric Johnson, professor of aerospace engineering, serves as the club's adviser.</p><p>\"This was a tough competition,\" said Amy Pritchett, professor and head of Penn State's Department of Aerospace Engineering. \"In the final phases, our student group went head-to-head with industry, the other academic teams having been washed out in earlier phases. Our team invented all the autonomy for the vehicle to completely fly itself and took top prize for that portion of the challenge. Their achievement is remarkable.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124607297</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637H-9GC1-DYTH-G207-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(U.S. Department of Defense photo) <br/>WASHINGTON - Battered by years of criticism from U.S. lawmakers and environmental advocates, the Department of Defense will stop purchasing PFAS-containing firefighting foam later this year and phase it out entirely in 2024. </p><p><br/>The replacement for Aqueous Film Forming Foam has yet to be determined, and advocates are frustrated it's taken so long to halt the use of a product containing a 'forever chemical' that at high levels of exposure may lead to increased risks for cancer,[1] among other effects. The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. <br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS - that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports, and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pfasmap.png\">https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pfasmap.png</url> (Source: U.S. Department of Defense) <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hangar sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s-t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup, and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist - for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion - the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected - in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy, and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips - an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions - for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration - hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires - these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) - that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/>The post Pentagon to halt use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS as cleanup costs mount[19] appeared first on New Hampshire Bulletin[20]. <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2] in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe\">https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe</url><br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fire-foam-Getty-scaled.jpg\">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fire-foam-Getty-scaled.jpg</url> Fire fighters still use foam to put out petroleum fires like this one at an ExxonMobil petroleum storage facility in 2003 in New York City. The foam can contain polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are known as forever chemicals because they don't break down easily and have contaminated ground water.

U.S. Air Force personnel from the 88th Air Base Wing Civil Engineer Group are leading the pilot study of new remediation techniques that can remove and destroy the PFAS. (Ty Greenlees/U.S. Air Force[6]) Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[7], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[8]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[9]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/> It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t. <br/> - MontanaU.S. Sen. Jon Tester <br/><br/><br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png\">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png</url> A map showing the location of military bases where the Department of Defense is assessing the impacts of firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals. (U.S. Department of Defense) Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[10]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[11]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[12]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cows-pfas-1178310633-scaled-1.jpeg\">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cows-pfas-1178310633-scaled-1.jpeg</url> Cows with high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, at a farm in Maine. (Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg) Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[13]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[14]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[15]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[16]andMinnesota[17]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[18]andSenate[19]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url

(Senior Airman Andrew Bertain/U.S. Space Force) <br/>WASHINGTON \u2014 Battered by years of criticism from U.S. lawmakers and environmental advocates, the Department of Defense will stop purchasing PFAS-containing firefighting foam later this year and phase it out entirely in 2024. </p><p><br/>The replacement for Aqueous Film Forming Foam has yet to be determined, and advocates are frustrated it's taken so long to halt the use of a product containing a 'forever chemical' that at high levels of exposure may lead to increased risks for cancer,[1] among other effects. The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. <br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/donate\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/donate</url><br/><br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-California, told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings on PFAS <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS-Use-map-across-U.S..jpg\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS-Use-map-across-U.S..jpg</url> As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the more than 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report. <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the Inspector General report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Foams are highly effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe</url><br/><br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of Department of Defense's PFAS investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the accountability office wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential health risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/> Need to get in touch? Have a news tip? <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@idahocapitalsun.com\">info@idahocapitalsun.com</email>  ; <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/>The post Pentagon to halt use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS as cleanup costs mount[19] appeared first on Idaho Capital Sun[20]. <br/> [ 1]: <url

This is the largest FEPP acquisition by the Bureau to date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FEPP makes former Department of Defense-owned property available for loan to state foresters through this U.S. Forest Service program at no cost; the vehicles then may be loaned to rural and wildland fire protection programs.</p><p>Items loaned through FEPP may be used for fire protection purposes and emergency service only. Trucks acquired through the program are often suitable for conversation to tankers or brush trucks.</p><p>N.H. Forest Protection acquired three five-ton and three 2.5-ton Stewart-Stevenson vehicles that can be retrofitted to hold 1,000-gallon tanks of water and 500-gallon tanks of water, respectively. Typically, vehicles used by local fire departments are limited to 100- or 250-gallon capacities.</p><p>The ability to transport large quantities of water to remote wildfires is key to suppression and containment. In addition to increased payload, the Stewart-Stevenson vehicles are able to travel over challenging terrain that consumer-grade vehicles cannot, making them ideal for fighting wildfires in remote areas.</p><p>\"Being able to facilitate getting these vehicles to New Hampshire and to then loan them to communities that can use their extra capacity will go a long way toward helping reduce potential wildfire damage in our state,\" said N.H. Forest Protection Bureau Chief Steven Sherman. \"The cost to purchase them would total more than $1 million, so having them as part of New Hampshire's wildfire fighting toolkit isn't just good practice, it's also a win from a fiscal standpoint.\"</p><p>While fire departments receive the vehicles at no cost, any retrofitting and maintenance is their responsibility. Additionally, the vehicles must be housed indoors, be inspected every two years by the Forest Protection Bureau and clearly display the N.H. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources logo. Failure to do so may result in the Bureau reassigning the vehicles to another fire department.</p><p>In order to be eligible for the program, New Hampshire fire departments must demonstrate a need for the vehicles as well as the ability to fund any retrofitting and maintenance costs.</p><p>Bartlett, Loudon and Temple will be loaned the 2.5 ton vehicles. Londonderry and Pembroke and will be loaned the five-ton vehicles, with an additional five-ton vehicle yet to be assigned.</p><p>The New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau, part of the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands, is responsible for protecting 4.5 million acres of both public and private New Hampshire forestlands from the threat of wildland fire and crimes against the forest resource. This is accomplished by forest rangers, fire patrolmen, fire tower personnel and support staff as well as the forest fire wardens and deputy wardens serving in each community.</p><p>From 2016-2020, New Hampshire experienced an average of 119 wildfires, impacting 276 acres annually.</p><p>The N.H. Forest Protection Bureau is part of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources' Division of Forests and Lands, which protects and promotes the value provided by trees, forests and natural communities.

I'm Paula Newton, ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russian President Vladimir Putin welcoming African leaders to St. Petersburg as war rages in Ukraine. We'll look at how he's trying to win their support while easing their fears over lost grain shipments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to CNN in response to the protests surrounding his controversial judicial reform plan. We'll have a live report as well from Tel Aviv.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Former U.S. President Trump now facing more charges in connection with classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Details on that and the latest person targeted in that investigation.</p><p>Day two of Russia's summit with African leaders is due to get underway at this hour in St. Petersburg. Now, President Vladimir Putin is trying to ease the concerns of countries losing out on grain shipments now that Moscow has pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal with Ukraine. Now, he's promising free Russian food supplies for six countries.</p><p>Mr. Putin says Russia is still a reliable source of food to Africa and a key partner in what he calls a new multipolar world.</p><p>Meantime, a number of African leaders say they want to discuss their plans for ending the war in Ukraine. Now, we're getting word, in fact, as well, of an alleged Ukrainian drone attack near the Russian capital. The Russian Defense Ministry says one drone was shot down in the Moscow region overnight without causing damage or casualties. CNN cannot independently confirm that report.</p><p>Meantime, the Ukrainian counteroffensive is keeping up the momentum. After kicking into higher gear in recent days, a new video shows Ukrainian troops rolling into a village in the Donetsk region on Thursday after fighting for it for weeks.</p><p>And for the very first time, a Ukrainian military vehicle was recorded along Russian anti-tank obstacles known as Dragon's Teeth. You will see it there. Now, the footage from southern Ukraine shows the vehicle. It is getting stuck in a ditch. You see it right there. But it does suggest that Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian forces behind this line of defense.</p><p>CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is standing by live for us in London with all of that, but we want to begin with our senior international correspondent David McKenzie, who is in Johannesburg for us. And David, you'll be able to bring us this perspective that we need, really, from what African countries are dealing with here. I mean, Russia has sustained much criticism for breaking that grain deal. And yet these African leaders are still looking for more from Putin. What would that be?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Paula, what they're looking for is assurances, different countries within the African continent, that the access to grain is not hampered by inflationary price pressure because of Russia pulling out of that deal.</p><p>Now, Vladimir Putin has put a positive spin on this. He says he will give a substantial amount of grain for free to at least six African countries. When the U.N. secretary-general was asked about that at the U.N. in New York, he said that you know, a handful of donations, as he put it, wouldn't counteract the dramatic impact of Russia pulling out of this deal.</p><p>Now, this deal was between Russia, Ukraine, brokered by Turkey and others to get grain out of Ukraine safely and onto the world markets. Putin, at this big Africa summit in St. Petersburg, has criticized the West, as he often does, for hypocrisy. He says that the grain was largely going to enrich, in his words, European companies, not African companies, but the impact on the price of grain is certainly being felt across the African continent and those leaders at that summit will want to get assurances from Putin.</p><p>And look at this image here. This is Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, with a very warm greeting of the Russian president arriving at that summit.</p><p>Now the relationship between South Africa and Russia has been under a microscope since the beginning of the conflict. Many Western diplomats have accused South Africa of saying they are not aligned, but acting as if they are supporting Russia.</p><p>We investigated whether it's money that's behind this policy initiative. [03:05:05]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): South Africa's policy on paper is non-alignment on the Ukraine wall. But its actions have deeply angered Western powers, consistently refusing to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the U.N. General Assembly.</p><p>In February, hosting naval war games with Russia and China on the anniversary of the start of the war, a powerful propaganda moment for Putin. And the U.S. ambassador publicly rebuked the government and ruling ANC, claiming there was intelligence showing weapons and ammunition loaded on a sanctioned cargo ship bound for Russia in December. It's now subject of a government inquiry.</p><p>REUBEN E. BRIGETY II, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH AFRICA: It's the observable gap between the rhetoric and the reality of a government's professed policy of non-alignment and neutrality.</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): The question is why? We've traveled to the remote Kalahari. In this desert soil, a high- lucrative manganese belt used in making steel and the United Manganese of Kalahari mines or UMK. First revealed by non-profit investigators at Amabungani, UMK has deep financial ties to this man Victor Wechselberg, a Russian oligarch linked to Vladimir Putin and to South Africa.</p><p>Here he is in 2006 in Cape Town, The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Wechselberg in 2018 and again in 2022 for supporting Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Spanish authorities and the FBI seized his $90 million superyacht Tango.</p><p>Despite the sanctions, Wechselberg still holds an important interest in UMK, according to business records held in Cyprus. Another significant player, holding company Chancellor House, for years channeling funds to the ruling African National Congress.</p><p>According to publicly available declarations, since 2021, UMK and Chancellor House combined have contributed at least $2.9 million to the financially struggling ANC.</p><p>(on-camera): This is a highly lucrative operation and anti-corruption activists say that these alleged linkages pose serious questions. Is South Africa's policy towards Russia on the world stage influenced by money?</p><p>Is it possible that foreign policy also has a link to corruption or at the very least to a conflict of interest?</p><p>KARAM SINGH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CORRUPTION WATCH: I think this is an increasing concern that we're now more alive to than ever before. That there could be foreign money from a Russian origin that comes into South Africa, that flows into different political coffers. And I think that could absolutely have an impact upon, you know, how South Africa takes positions on certain policies.</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): Substantial investment, preferential trade policies, and critical foreign aid from the U.S. and European Union are crucial to South Africa, the world's most unequal country, dwarfing Russia's contribution in both trade and aid.</p><p>STEVEN GRUZD, RUSSIA-AFRICA ANALYST, SAIIA: I think South Africa is playing a dangerous game here, and indeed sometimes politicians are putting the political party, the ANC before the needs of the citizens, because it just doesn't make sense to be so closely associated with Russia when the stakes are so high and there's so much at risk.</p><p>MCKENZIE (on-camera): And what does that risk for South Africa?</p><p>GRUZD: So it risks investment, it risks trade, it risks jobs, it risks economic growth, it risks the currency, it risks isolation from the West. I think there's a lot at stake here.</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): A lot at stake for a country that there is much to lose.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCKENZIE (on-camera): Now Paula, we've reached out to the parties involved, Chancellor House, UMK and Wechselberg, Renova Group all deny any wrongdoing, any undue influence on the ANC or any sanctions violations. They said the party donations were above board, legal and without preconditions.</p><p>Now tellingly the ANC did not sit down for an interview or after multiple attempts refused to give us a statement. Later on today we'll have a more in-depth report on cnn.com. Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, and we'll wait for that report. Thanks so much, David. I Appreciate it.</p><p>Now we want to bring in our Salma Abdelaziz, who's in London now. We want to get back to what has been going on the ground in Ukraine. And I confess, going through reports of what's been happening on the front lines in several different locations, it is a bit confusing. Some experts have noted that Ukraine has made some gains, but how can we best describe the counteroffensive at this point?</p><p>[03:09:58]</p><p>SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think very modest gains, Paula, is the best way to describe that. So far, of course, we're several months into this counteroffensive that was much delayed, much anticipated, and so far no major victories. And by that I mean that we have not seen Ukrainian forces truly break through Russian defensive positions and that's the key here. That's the aim here.</p><p>And why is that Paula? Well, there's a couple of complications challenges here, of course, that Ukrainian forces face. First of all is just the length of the front line I mean you are talking about hundreds of miles of battlefield that run from the north of the country down to the Bakhmut the Donetsk region all the way to the south Which is of course the focus for Ukrainian forces around the Zaporizhia region to stretch out Ukrainian troops across all of that, all of those many, many miles is, as you can imagine, an extreme strain on the country's resources.</p><p>You also, of course, have to remember air support. Russian forces have air support backing them, and some Ukrainian forces are describing some of these battlefields as hell-like, saying that they are being struck first by Russian artillery and then backed by Russian air power, by Russian helicopters dropping explosives on them. And then the other thing you have to remember of course is just as Ukraine has been preparing for this offensive for months, so has Russia.</p><p>Ukraine's defense minister recently admitting of course that they are behind schedule, but saying look, Russia has been digging in its defensive positions for a long time now. I know you brought up that video just before we spoke of the dragon's teeth. So these are Russian defensive positions to the south of Zaporizhzhya, where you see a Russian -- a Ukrainian tank, rather, there trying to break through. It gets stuck in a ditch.</p><p>What is significant about that is it appears to show that Ukrainian forces have been able to reach those defensive lines, but clearly not crossing them, not breaking them. And that's just in one small location, again, all along that huge battlefield.</p><p>Well, how does this play out? First of all, you're going to see Ukraine's strategy shift, not just from the immediate front lines, but to areas outside of the bounds of those front lines, if you will. Increased drone attacks on Moscow, increased covert attacks on Russian-occupied regions like Crimea or near Crimea.</p><p>You're also going to see Ukraine try to take out Russian supply lines. So take the city of Tamak, which is, again, a logistical hub for Russia near Crimea, Ukrainian forces have been pummeling that position for some time now, trying again to drain, to weaken Russian defensive positions.</p><p>But Russia's response to that is quite similar. Also, the Kremlin trying to take out areas outside of the bounds of the battlefield. I know we have those images to show you of President Zelenskyy just a couple of days ago, or just about a day ago, in Odessa surveying the damage from a Russian strike on Odessa there, that's a cathedral that was hit, and you're gonna continue to see those types of attacks, not just all along the front lines, but also outside the bounds of these front lines as these two fighting forces try to weaken each other.</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, notable, that damage there in Odessa, especially as what the Ukrainian government won't let us see is a significant damage to the port. Salma Abdelaziz for us in London, thanks so much.</p><p>To Israel now, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is downplaying the country's new judicial reform law. That's what he calls a minor correction to the balance of power. But thousands of Israelis, they don't see it that way.</p><p>Mass demonstrations returned to Tel Aviv on Thursday, one day after a new law went into effect that sharply undermines the country's Supreme Court. And the Prime Minister is promising more reforms to come.</p><p>The Supreme Court declined to block the new law from taking effect but said it will review it in September. Now despite the protest, Israel's prime minister is defending the judicial changes he's pushed through.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu spoke earlier with CNN's Wolf Blitzer and insisted the new rules will bring balance back to Israel's system of government. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: In Israel, we have, the Supreme Court has a lot of checks, but there are no balances. For example, on the court on the decision that we passed on reasonableness. Understand what that is. It's like the court can nullify a decision, any decision, by the government, by the executive, by saying it's unreasonable, not because it's illegal, not because they're using other checks that they have, plenty of things that they could do. They can nullify an appointment.</p><p>It's like the Supreme Court would be able to nullify an appointment by President Biden, not by saying that there's a conflict of interest. That exists today in Israel that it's an undue process that exists today in Israel, that it's not proportional, that exists in Israel. But just by saying, we don't think this appointment is reasonable. That doesn't exist in America. It doesn't exist in most democracies, not to this scope.</p><p>[03:15:05]</p><p>And that's the minor correction that we made that is now called the end of democracy. If that's the end of democracy, there are no democracies, because none of them have this.</p><p>We've trimmed this reform. Let's tell the truth. We trimmed it. We've listened to the -- the concerns of the opposition and broad spectrum of the public. I think they're wrong in a lot of things, but I think they have points, important points. So we trimmed it down to a minor thing on reasonableness.</p><p>We're trying now to achieve -- I gave a push-to-pause button on the legislation, in which I had a majority, for three months, tried to negotiate with the opposition. They wouldn't agree to anything, even a minor change. But I'm not giving up. And I think the fact that we- that we won this particular round, I think maybe gives us the opportunity when they see that we have a majority to legislate without them, maybe we'll be able to legislate with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Elliot Gotkine joins us from Tel Aviv this hour, and you've been monitoring that interview along with us. You heard the prime minister. He won. But what's next for this law? And obviously all those Israelis who oppose it. We talk about this review in September by the Supreme Court, but can it be significant?</p><p>ELLIOT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: It will be hugely significant. And yes, Netanyahu has won this battle, but he hasn't yet won the war. That, I suppose, will be decided by the Supreme Court. As for the people who are opposed to this, those protests will continue. We're expecting more mass protests tomorrow evening as well.</p><p>But of course, what happens now? We've got this review coming up in September. As of now, this new basic law on reasonableness that prevents the Supreme Court blocking appointments or decisions by government on the grounds of reasonableness, that is now law. It is now one of Israel's quasi-constitutional basic laws.</p><p>And in terms of the review, I suppose there are a couple of things that could happen. First of all, it could say, no, this law is perfectly fine. And then that would probably take a bit of the wind out of the sails of some of those protesters you see there on the streets.</p><p>However, it could, of course, strike down this law. Now, that is something it's never done. The Supreme Court in Israel has never before struck down one of Israel's quasi-constitutional basic laws.</p><p>So that would be very interesting to see. And Netanyahu, in that interview with Wolf Blitzer, did not directly answer the question as to whether his government would abide by a Supreme Court ruling that would strike down this new reasonableness bill. And as to Netanyahu's points comparing it with the United States, of course, in the U.S., President Biden's appointments, his Cabinet appointments and ambassadors, things like that, have to be approved by the Senate.</p><p>As for constitutional amendments, an amendment in the U.S., an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or of two-thirds of the states, request one by convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three- fourths of the state legislatures or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification.</p><p>Netanyahu has effectively made a constitutional amendment with a simple majority, 64 seats out of 120. So it's kind of comparing apples with oranges a bit. But for now, all eyes will be on September and what the Supreme Court does. And then if it does strike down that law, what this government's response will be. Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, and if the Prime Minister wants to know how divisive is, he needs to look no further than the streets in Israel and see all the protests. I think what you've outlined to us in recent weeks, Elliot, if you can remind everyone again, how can this new law really change how Israel is governed? What kind of new powers could any Prime Minister, not just Netanyahu, have?</p><p>GOTKINE: Well, I'll give you a very specific example. And actually, Netanyahu was asked this in an interview with National Public Radio with NPR. So, for example, to most people who weren't kind of on the inside or very keen Israeli political watchers, this reasonableness concept really came to the fore earlier this year, when Netanyahu tried to appoint as minister Aryeh Derry. He heads up the religious Shas Party, which mainly represents Israeli Jews of Middle Eastern origin.</p><p>Now, Aryeh Derry has been convicted three times, most recently of tax fraud. Netanyahu wanted to make him a minister, but the Supreme Court said no, that wasn't reasonable. It said this was due to his backlog of criminal convictions and his failure to retire from public life as he said he would when being sentenced in the tax fraud case.</p><p>So the most immediate possibility of an impact of this law, and Netanyahu was asked about this and alluded to this and suggested that he would do this perhaps, is to reappoint Aryeh Derry as a minister because the Supreme Court would right now not be able to say you can't do that on the grounds of reasonableness. Paula?</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, a very practical application there which may be tested in the coming months. Elliot, thanks so much again. I Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, Donald Trump's list of legal troubles just keeps getting longer. The special counsel has filed a slew of new charges against the former president in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents indictment.</p><p>CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid, has those details.</p><p>[03:20:05]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA REID, CNN SR. LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: New charges and a new co-defendant for former President Trump in the criminal case alleging that he mishandled classified documents down at his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p><p>Now, prosecutors have charged him with an additional count of willful retention of national defense information as well as two additional counts of obstruction, alleging that the former president and two of his employees attempted to destroy surveillance footage from Mar-a- Lago from the summer of 2022. That surveillance footage is really at the heart of this investigation.</p><p>It's key evidence for prosecutors as they try to put together where exactly classified materials were moved on the Mar-a-Lago property after the former president left office.</p><p>But we also know that witnesses have been asked if anyone tried to prevent them from getting all of that surveillance footage or if anyone tried to tamper with it or destroy it.</p><p>Now, according to the superseding indictment, two Trump employees wanted to destroy this surveillance footage because, quote, \"the boss wanted it gone.\"</p><p>Now, the new charges were filed only against former President Trump and his co-defendant Walt Nauta, but they also added a new co- defendant, Carlos de Oliveira. He is a maintenance worker at Mar-a- Lago, and he has been seen on surveillance footage with Walt Nauta moving boxes that contain classified information, including one incident where they moved boxes out of a storage closet right before one of Trump's lawyers went to search that closet for classified documents.</p><p>Now, Carlos is represented by a lawyer who is paid for by a Trump- linked political action committee. His lawyer tonight had no comment, but they're both expected to appear in court next week.</p><p>Paula Reid, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) NEWTON: Now Trump is denying all of the charges against him and in a statement a Trump spokesperson called the latest ones quote, \"nothing more than a continued desperate and flailing attempt by the Biden crime family and their Department of Justice to harass President Trump and those around him.\"</p><p>Niger's military and some protesters voiced their support for the coup in the West African country. We will have a live report from the region, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: Chaotic scenes in uncertain times in Niger as the country's military gives its support to the ongoing coup, and it appears they're not alone.</p><p>Pro-military protesters set fires around the party headquarters of the ousted president Thursday. The military has suspended all activities of political parties and is warning against foreign intervention. And it says it supports the coup in hopes of preventing bloodshed and maintaining, in its words, people's well-being.</p><p>[03:25:02]</p><p>CNN's Larry Madowo has been following all of these developments for us from Nairobi, and he joins us now. It is almost 8:30 in the morning in Niger, a new day and a week of pretty terrible turmoil. I mean, what are you expecting, and what more do we know about how Niger will be governed going forward, not to mention where the president is right now?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So, Paula, I think the only thing we can say is to expect the unexpected, because so far, since Wednesday, that's what's happened in Niger. How will the country be governed? We're going to have to wait and hear from these soldiers who took over the country. They're calling themselves the Council to safeguard the homeland.</p><p>And no one has been named leader yet. So there could be a transitional military council. Will they commit themselves, for instance, to a timeline to return to civilian rule or elections? We don't know. And then were also hearing this statement from the French foreign minister who said that this is not a complete coup yet. In fact, the ousted president Mohamed Bazoum has spoken to President Emmanuel Macron of France on the phone. He's reachable, he's in good health. That's what the French foreign minister is saying.</p><p>There has been calls internationally from the U.N., from the African Union, from France, from lots of other international bodies, the economic community of West African states for his release and a return to that civilian rule. But we just don't know because these men have not said anything yet.</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, and the people in Niger are obviously caught in the middle of all this. How is that impacting them? MADOWO: You mentioned these pro-military protests we saw on Thursday outside the National Assembly. They set the party headquarters of President Mohamed Bazoum on fire. But that was in reaction on Wednesday to pro-democracy protesters that also showed up on the streets shortly after it was first reported that President Bazoum was being held in the presidential palace. So there is some support for the military here. There is also some support for the democratically elected government.</p><p>President Bazoum was the first time since 1960 that Niger had seen a peaceful democratic transfer of power. And it's important because it's part of a really unsafe neighborhood. This is something that the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres touched on in his remarks yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: You have military regimes in Mali, in Burkina Faso, now eventually in Niger, a fragile transition in Chad, and an horrible situation in Sudan. So we are witnessing that the whole belt south of the Sahara is becoming an extremely problematic area with terrible consequences for their populations and with terrible consequences for peace and stability in the African continent and further afield.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADOWO: The Army Command has supported these soldiers that took over the country and they warned against any foreign military intervention saying it would have disastrous and uncontrolled consequences. Part of the anger here and some people feel that President Bazoum was an ally of the West, of France, and the U.S. and they want a different direction from that, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, I mean they talk about no foreign intervention. We'll see a foreign influence though, can perhaps, as you said, have a different complexion to whoever takes over in Niger right now. Larry Madowo for us, I know you'll continue to watch those developments throughout the day. I Appreciate it.</p><p>Still ahead for us, on alert across southern Italy, dozens of tourists evacuated as wildfires erupt near a popular tourist area, and millions across China are in the path of a powerful typhoon. We are tracking that storm.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:30:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers from all around the world. I'm Paula Newton and you are watching \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>A new wildfire has erupted in southern Italy's Puglia region. CNN affiliate Sky24 reports about 100 people had to be evacuated from popular beaches on the Adriatic Sea. A slight break in the heat wave has brought some relief for firefighters, though authorities say fires in Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria are now 95 percent contained. The government is set to announce a state of emergency for several days other regions affected by extreme weather.</p><p>Our Nada Bashir is following developments from Rome now. Now you know Europe needs all the relief it can get and yet the forecast is still calling for pretty high temperatures through the weekend and into next week. I mean how are the firefighting resources holding up there?</p><p>NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Well, Paula, it seems as though every time we hear that a fire has been contained, another one erupts across the Mediterranean, not least here in Italy, as you mentioned there, another fire yesterday erupting in Puglia.</p><p>Despite the fact that we have seen a break in the heat wave, we've seen temperatures dropping and the hope was that this would mark a shift in the situation in Italy's southern region. But of course, concerns are still high. We are still seeing strong winds, and that could lead to another devastating set of fires across the southern region.</p><p>But in Sicily which was deeply impacted earlier this week. Those fires have largely been contained. Those who were evacuated, thousands of them, have been told they can return home. And the alert level has been downgraded. But as you mentioned, there are still calls for a state of emergency to be put in place in numerous regions across southern Italy, many of these regions still putting in those requests that are still under consideration, according to the Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni.</p><p>But of course, this is a reflection of what is happening across the Mediterranean in Greece. We are still seeing firefighters battling blazes across the country on the island of Rhodes, though it is largely impacting uninhabited forest areas. Those fires continue to rage on and of course that is impacting many residents there and tourists as well.</p><p>Meanwhile in Corfu, we know that this is largely controlled now at this stage, but we are learning about the devastating impact this has had on Rhodes. Researchers in Greece say that around 10 percent of its land has now been destroyed by this latest forest fire.</p><p>We heard from the Greek Prime Minister speaking yesterday saying that the country needs to get better at preparing for these situations and tackling these extreme heat events. And of course, we did see that really worrying concerning data yesterday released by the E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service. And I'll just walk you through a few of the key points out of that report.</p><p>July already set to be the hottest month on record before the month has even ended. Every day since July 3rd has been hotter than the records set in 2016. And almost every month this year has been in the top five, the hottest on record. Real warning signs there. We're hearing from experts saying this is going to become the new normal, that we need to do more to prepare for these situations. In the coming years, these extreme heat events are not only going to become more frequent, but also more severe. Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General, saying we've surpassed the warming time period. It's now the boiling era for Earth. The really worrying facts and figures there. Nada Bashir for us in Rome, thanks so much.</p><p>Now, record high temperatures aren't just unpleasant. We don't have to remind you they can be incredibly dangerous. And the problem is made even worse when you add stifling humidity into that mix.</p><p>Eleni Giokos has a story now from a very steamy Abu Dhabi.</p><p>[03:35:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Around the world, countries are facing extreme heat waves. China posted an all-time high temperature of 126 degrees Fahrenheit in July, while parts of Europe are nudging towards 120 Fahrenheit.</p><p>The U.S. southwest also sweltering in 110-degree-plus temperatures. And really feeling the heat has been parts of the Middle East. The region is well used to scorching summers.</p><p>(on-camera): On a normal day in summer in the Gulf, the heat makes you feel like you're an egg in a hot pan. It is absolutely sizzling, but we adapt. We mostly stay indoors. But when you do step outside, the heat and the humidity hits you.</p><p>(voice-over): That humidity is the real problem. Scientists were alarmed when a heat index of 152 Fahrenheit was observed at the Persian Gulf International Airport in Iran because the air was saturated with so much water vapor.</p><p>Essentially, the heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body taking humidity into account. This combination of high heat and humidity can quickly become deadly. Our bodies have their own natural cooling system. Heat can escape through convection and radiation, but only when the air temperature is lower than our bodies. Sweating is then our only option. The water evaporating from our skin cools us down. However, humidity can get in the way of this.</p><p>(on-camera): It is so humid that I need to wipe down the lens. It is just after 8 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. My hygrometer says we're sitting above 35 degrees Celsius. Humidity at 61 percent. It's showing so much water vapor in the air. The real feel temperature is sitting at around 48 degrees Celsius. Now, at this kind of humidity, sweat or any kind of water will not evaporate from the skin.</p><p>I want to show you. I'm just spraying some water on my skin right now. this water isn't going anywhere anytime soon. A cold glass of water much needed in this heat, the hot air holds so much water vapor that as soon as it touches the cold glass, it immediately starts to condense. And this is where it becomes tricky. Your body's inability to release sweat and for that to evaporate so that you can cool down.</p><p>(voice-over): Heat indices of 160 degrees Fahrenheit are widely considered the upper threshold of what humans can endure for not more than a few hours, though recent studies suggest the true threshold may be even lower. The body attempts to cool itself down by dilating vessels and upping the heart rate. This can lead to organ damage or heat stroke. So while people are struggling with heat already, a few extra degrees and humid conditions could be even more deadly.</p><p>Eleni Giokos, CNN, Abu Dhabi.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Officials in Mexico, meantime, say heat waves gripping that country have killed 249 people in the past four months. Most of the deaths were due to heat stroke and the rest were due to dehydration. The government also reported more than 3,000 cases of people getting sick from those high temperatures.</p><p>Typhoon Doksuri has made landfall in southeastern China, bringing torrential rain and winds approaching 175 kilometers per hour. The storm's whipped up huge waves sending them crashing into the shore. Earlier the typhoon caused major flooding in Taiwan. In the Philippines, at least 39 people were killed, including dozens on an overcrowded boat that capsized in strong winds.</p><p>CNN's Chad Myers reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Pictures out of the Philippines right now. Obviously significant flooding from the typhoon. The typhoon that was 220 KPH as it made landfall just on the northern islands there of the Philippines. An awful lot of tree damage, limbs damaged, all the way power lines down. This was a very big rainmaker as well.</p><p>Look at all the places where 600 millimeters or more. That's more than a foot and a half of rainfall that came down just from that storm. Numbers still coming up from Taiwan because it's still raining. I suspect, probably get much higher numbers there. Most of the damage and the likely landslides and mudslides will be on the east side of Taiwan. That's not the highly populated area. But where does this go now?</p><p>Well, it does go into a highly populated area and that is mainland China. There are millions and millions of people in the way of this storm and it's still going to be about 110 kph well inland with an awful lot of rainfall coming down. There it goes on up to the north. But here's something else.</p><p>That's the next storm. That's the next likely typhoon that is right now just developing in the water, well to the east of Tacloban there in the Philippines. And this is going to note just a little bit farther to the north, likely to the north of Taiwan.</p><p>[03:40:07]</p><p>But notice right there, that's Okinawa at 205 kilometers per hour. And then the next stop would be very close to Shanghai. This could obviously go left or right. There's no question about that, that this storm could waver one way or the other because it really isn't even done fully developing yet. But we're already getting damage out of the Philippines and I suspect we'll likely get more pictures soon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Our thanks to Chad Myers there.</p><p>Now North Korea is bringing out the big missiles for its best friends. Details on this latest show of force and who the North is trying to impress.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: A military parade capped off the festivities from what North Korea calls Victory Day. Now the rest of the world knows it as the anniversary of the ceasefire that ended the fighting on the Korean Peninsula, if not the war. That was 70 years ago this week. But the North used the occasion to roll out its most powerful missiles into the main square in Pyongyang. Guests of honor were high-level delegations from both China and Russia. And the Russians brought a special message from President Vladimir Putin,</p><p>CNN's Marc Stewart is following this lie from Tokyo. It wasn't just the message, right? It was the defense minister himself. Now, look, Marc, we're very used to these expressions of grandeur during these military parades, but the political purpose here really has echoes of the Cold War, right?</p><p>MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Indeed, Paula, as you well know, this is very much according to script. North Korea looks for these moments to make these symbolic shows of power. This parade is no exception. In fact, we saw a whole arsenal of military apparatus. We saw tanks, we saw missiles, but we also saw what are being described as drones by state media.</p><p>One type of drone that can do reconnaissance work, another that is being described as a multi-purpose attack drone. And again, this comes at a time when North Korea has the attention not only of its citizens, but also delegations from China and from Russia have been there over the last 48 hours.</p><p>You did allude to the presence of Russia. In fact, a speech was given by Vladimir Putin. Not clear if this was something that was delivered on video or just written copy. But he does basically thank North Korea for their support of its efforts in Ukraine saying that these two nations are almost ripe to confront the rest of the Western world because of this mutual support. So these are some of the messages that we have been hearing over the last 24 hours coming from North Korea.</p><p>[03:45:01]</p><p>Paula, I should also point out this is coming at a time when there is tension within this whole region. In fact, in recent days, we have seen a United States submarine in some of the ports of South Korea, a submarine that has nuclear capability. It is obviously drawing some condemnation from North Korea.</p><p>In fact, within the last few hours, we've been going through some remarks from North Korea's defense minister, who gave a rather bellicose speech talking about stability in the region and with a message directly targeted toward South Korea, toward Japan, toward the United States. We're going through those remarks. Hopefully get some context to all of that. And once we do, we'll certainly pass that along, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Yeah, and we will wait to hear more on that, especially at this point in time when North Korea remains emboldened, especially now gaining more support from China and Russia just in the last few days. Marc Stewart for us in Tokyo. Good to see you.</p><p>Anthony Rinna, senior editor, Sino-NK and is a specialist on Korea- Russia relations and he joins us now from Sejong City in South Korea. Really good to have you on the show. You know what seems pretty clear is that North Korea has a lot to gain from this alliance but I think what is really a more interesting question is what about Russia? I mean these pictures that we've been seeing are so notable but with everything going on in Ukraine you actually have Shoigu front and center in North Korea. Why?</p><p>ANTHONY RINNA, SR. EDITOR, SINO-NK: Well, excuse me. I think the biggest reason why is because what we have to remember about Russia, especially from a geographical position, is it's a very -- it's a vastly expansive country. It spans 11 time zones and Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula, you know, despite the fact that they know themselves are so geographically disparate, they are on opposite ends of the Russian landmass.</p><p>And these, both of these points from a geopolitical perspective, they actually represent or constitute weak points for Russia. Russia's influence in Ukraine has always been a lot stronger, obviously, than it has been over the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>But if you take Russian geography as a whole, Russia has obviously felt sort of boxed in or felt that its geopolitical space has been encroached on by NATO for, you know, at least during the Cold War and then especially thereafter. Whereas with the Korean Peninsula, Russia and the Soviet Union before that had always felt that way, you know, ever since the 1950, 1953 conflict with the stationing of U.S. forces in Korea and Japan.</p><p>So the way I see it personally is I feel that by trying to shore up ties with North Korea, Russia's actually trying to secure both ends of its periphery, its eastern end and its western end. The war in Ukraine, of course, being a, you know, most unfortunate result of Russia's perception of encroachment or its perception of vulnerability in that regard.</p><p>But then, you know, the Korean peninsula I think is something that we also can't, you know, we can't neglect, especially given the fact that North Korea, for its own reasons, has been, has just been unabashed, absolutely 100 percent supportive of Russia's full-scale invasion.</p><p>NEWTON: Right. But I also, I also think if you look at that eastern flank, and Russia obviously does share a border with North Korea, we're talking about what could be a very menacing nuclear-armed state at one point in time. You'd think that wasn't something that was in Russia's interest?</p><p>RINNA: Yes, and that's long been part of the Russian narrative that, you know, they don't want the DPRK to acquire nuclear weapons, that they want something, whether it be disarmament or, you know, recently it's been more of a focus on arms control.</p><p>But especially with the revisions in North Korea's nuclear doctrine towards the end of last year, when you look at Russia's reaction towards that, Russia's reaction was largely one of, you know, this is a done deal, it was somewhat inevitable, and in all cases, whether it was, you know, supporting some sort of an arms control regime with North Korea or even more recently, this sort of pass-aid attitude, or at least a more acquiescing attitude, as it were, it's there, the subtext has always been to blame the United States.</p><p>So I feel that the Korean Peninsula has always been sort of a secondary, but still very real geopolitical theater in Russia-U.S. tensions.</p><p>[03:50:02]</p><p>And you're absolutely right. And that does beg the question, now, especially with Shoigu showing up at this exhibition and, you know, seeing these, you know, these weapons, will we see a fundamental shift in Russia's attitude? And, you know, if that's the case, if they end up understands fundamentally, then all that will really do, you know, for policymakers in the West will show that Russia was never really sincere about its desire for stability on the Korean Peninsula in the first place.</p><p>NEWTON: Right. And that this may serve their interests in terms of especially what's going on in Ukraine right now. Anthony Rinna, we'll have to leave it there for now. Thanks so much.</p><p>RINNA: All right, thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: Now a shock win at the Women's World Cup, how Nigeria took down one of its hosts.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: In the Women's World Cup, England and Denmark will soon fight for the top spot in Group D. They kick off in just over a half an hour from now. Now earlier today a stunning comeback by Argentina. South Africa went into the half with a comfortable two-goal lead. But the blue and white came roaring back drawing the match level in the 79th minute. Both teams walked away with one point each. The first ever in fact for South Africa in the Women's World Cup.</p><p>Meantime there was a big upset on Thursday. CNN's Don Riddell has those highlights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: The host teams at the Women's World Cup had made winning starts, meaning that both New Zealand and Australia went into their second group matches knowing they could advance to the knockout stage. But now both will have an anxious wait.</p><p>New Zealand lost to the Philippines on Tuesday, and now the Aussies have lost to Nigeria, a stunning upset in Brisbane on Thursday. Australia have been struggling with injuries, Sam Kerr and others out for this game, but you still would have fancied them to see off one of the weaker teams in the world rankings.</p><p>Emily van Egman putting the Matildas ahead in the first half injury time and they would have expected to carry that lead into the halftime team talk but they say you are at your most vulnerable when you've just scored and so it proved Nigeria equalized through Uchenna Kanu in the sixth minute of stoppage time and the Super Falcons kept it going after the break. Osinachi Ohale tracking the ball to throw her head at it for a 2-1 lead that was a brave header and the Aussies are reeling.</p><p>The nine-time African champions had brought Barcelona's Asisat Oshoala off the bench just before that goal. She scored Nigeria's third of the night from a tight angle. Australia scored a late consolation, but they couldn't find an equalizer leaving Nigeria to celebrate a momentous win. The Super Falcons are now top of Group B.</p><p>ASISAT OSHOALA, NIGERIAN STRIKER: I think I'm going to give kudos to my teammates. Everyone went out there to play their heart out. No one knows what is team is made of, we only have to come to the field and show ourselves and show the kind of heart we have. Like I said earlier, this team has a lot to offer. And everyone and the world has seen that today. Nigeria for love! Let (EXPLETIVE) go!</p><p>RIDDELL: What an achievement having silenced the crowd outside Nigeria were making all the noise inside this was the scene in their locker room afterwards dancing and singing songs of celebration.</p><p>[03:55:07]</p><p>This is the situation now in group B. Nigeria are top ahead of Canada on goal difference and Australia's last game is going to be tough against Canada, the Olympic champions on Monday. The co-hosts need a big result if they want to stick around for the knockout stage. Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Our thanks to Don there. Now meantime, Ukraine is protesting the disqualification of a top member of its national fencing team from the World Championship after she refused to shake her Russian opponent's hand.</p><p>Four-time world champion Olga Kharlan of Ukraine beat Anna Smirnova at that tournament in Milan. The Ukrainians celebrated, but instead of shaking hands with her rival, Kharlan offered to tap saber blades.</p><p>Smirnova, competing as a neutral, walked away and sat in protest for 45 minutes. Kharlan says she acted with her heart and thanked her supporters and especially the Ukrainian military. Now, she said Ukrainians can never be, in her words, forced into peace by any handshake.</p><p>Since Russia invaded Ukraine, other Ukrainians have done the same thing in other sports and we will wait to see how this is handled as we await the Olympics a year from now.</p><p>Now, an Iranian chess player who competed without wearing a hijab, as her nation required, officially has a new home. Sarah Kadem has been granted Spanish nationality. Spain's justice minister called her circumstances, quote, \"exceptional.\" In December Kadem took part in a world championship chess tournament in Kazakhstan without wearing the head covering which is mandatory for women in Iran. According to Reuters an arrest warrant was issued for her by Tehran but Kadem never returned home. She's been living in Spain ever since.</p><p>Scientists say there are signs of a nearby star system may someday be able to actually support life. Now, astronomers found evidence of water vapor swirling close to star 370, to a star, pardon me, 370 light years away. The water was found in a planet-forming disk. The rocky planets of our solar system, in fact, were formed in a similar way billions of years ago. The discovery was made using the Webb Telescope. Experts say it would have been impossible to make this kind of discovery before that impressive Webb Telescope.</p><p>I'm Paula Newton.

Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" extreme weather across the U.S. Deadly flooding in the northeast and a record setting heat wave to the west, with no relief in sight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Records also being set in Europe just as tourism season reaches its peak. We are live in Rome with a look at how the ancient city is dealing with its modern threat. Plus, the Gilgo Beach murders, we will talk with the author of a best-selling book examining the case from the very beginning. Why he says that the police were so quick, at first, to dismiss the young female victims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good to have you with us. We begin with extreme weather around the world, starting here in the United States where more than 18 million people are under heat alerts and 14 states, stretching from Washington State all the way to Florida. A dangerous heat dome remains locked down over the western U.S. and the relentless blistering temperatures are breaking records by the day.</p><p>The National Weather Service says about three dozen daily high temperature records were broken on Sunday, and parts of California, Nevada, and Arizona are seeing the mercury shoot well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Well, people in southern Europe are also sweltering with a scorching heat wave coming right in the midst of the busy summer tourist season.</p><p>On the Spanish island of La Palma, a forest fire is only making matters worse. It's burning out of control forcing at least 4,000 people to evacuate. In Italy, it least one person has died and several tourists have collapsed from the heat. Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence are under extreme health risks because of the heat and people in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain are also facing dangerously high temperatures.</p><p>So, let's bring in CNN's Barbie Nadeau. She joins us live from Rome. So, Barbie, what is the latest on this record heat hitting Italy and, of course, other parts of Europe?</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER: Yeah. You know, here in Rome, certainly we're expecting temperatures to really rise today and tomorrow. They are warning people that we could really break a record. The record, of course, just set last year in Rome, in June of last year, 40.7 degrees. Expecting it could rise above that today, almost certain tomorrow.</p><p>We're seeing the same sort of warnings in southern Italy, in Sicily especially. They are looking at topping the all-time European record which was 48.8, set last year as well. So, temperatures are going to get hot. We've just seen this continuation of the rise in temperatures as --- as you said, as you mentioned, you know, the height of tourist season. These tourists have been here, their trips are planned, and they're not changing their plans at all, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: And Barbie, here in the United States, the elderly and other vulnerable citizens and are often advised to seek out air-conditioned centers for relief from the heat. So, what are citizens across Italy being told to do at this time, given there is not a lot of access to air-conditioned areas?</p><p>NADEAU: No, that's right. But you have to remember people in Italy are in front of the Mediterranean region, know how to deal with heat. This heat is common, it's always hot in the summer in southern Europe. This heat is a little bit extreme, but people understand. They are smarter than the tourists in a lot of ways because they're not out running around during the heat of the day.</p><p>You know, we don't have the so-called air conditioning centers here in Italy, but there are places that are air conditioned. Shopping malls, stores, things like that. You know, you've got people flocking to places like that. And air conditioning is becoming more and more common in places like -- certainly in places like Rome and Florence and things like that.</p><p>But, you know, people know how to deal with the heat here. It's really the tourists who are the main problem because they are out during the heat of the day, during the hottest times. We've seen, you know, for the last several days, people lining up under the blazing sun in the Roman Coliseum. I can guarantee you there aren't any Italians among them. They know how to deal with this.</p><p>And so, the authorities are less concerned about that. Of course, elderly people, vulnerable people, people who have respiratory problems, they are really being cared for. But, you know, Italian health services are very good with those people, making sure everybody has access to that kind of health care if they are vulnerable.</p><p>[02:05:02]</p><p>But, again, you know, it's the tourists that the authorities are more worried about at this point because they are the ones that are not taking the advice very seriously, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: Yeah, yeah. Good point. Barbie Nadeau, joining us live from Rome. Many thanks.</p><p>Well, it appears that the massive heat wave in the southwestern U.S. has a firm grip on conditions for at least the next week. CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller tells us if there is any sign of relief in sight.</p><p>BRANDON MILLER, CNN METEOROLOGIST: So, the question everyone wants to know is when will the heat wave in the U.S. southwest break? And the answer is no time soon. These above average temperatures, if we put this in the motion going through the work week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, into Thursday, they really just expand.</p><p>The high pressure that's been here over the four corners region, near Nevada, just sort of drift a little bit, but that heat dome stays massive and it blocks any of these winds and rain that could cool things off and things are going to stay 10, 15 degrees above average. That is Fahrenheit, above average, for the next, at least, week. And we're talking the hottest times of the year.</p><p>So, take your hottest time of the year, add 10 to 15 degrees fahrenheit, and that is where we are. Nearly every day this week, in Phoenix, will be a record high. That is scary and what is even scarier are the lows; 94, 95, 94, those would be in the top of 5 to 10 hottest nights Phoenix has ever had, any one of them, and you've got seven in a row. It's been since last Sunday when the low dropped below 90.</p><p>So, that is a record stretch for them. We are setting records everywhere. Las Vegas more of the same, looking at setting a record and then staying above 110 all week long. Again, lows not dropping down where they should be. That is where heat turns deadly. The next several days here, going through, actually next weekend.</p><p>Here in the northern plains and even the northeast, you've been dealing with a lot of rain. You are dealing with smoke from the Canadian wildfires, but you are at least staying out of this record heat wave that shows no signs of breaking in the U.S. Back to you.</p><p>CHURCH: Thanks for that. And as Brandon just mentioned, in the northeast United States, it is not excessive heat, but too much rain all at once. Authorities in Pennsylvania are searching for a two-year- old and an infant who disappeared in flash flood waters. The children's mother and four others died in that flooding.</p><p>Well. the storms also put major airports in New York and Boston under ground stop Sunday afternoon. Conditions have forced airlines to cancel nearly 2,000 U.S. flights since early Sunday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.</p><p>To Asia now, and authorities in South Korea say 40 people have now died from flash floods and landslides in the past few days. Nine people are still missing. What you are seeing now is one of the most concentrated disaster areas, a flooded underpass in central South Korea. Emergency workers recovered the bodies of 13 people who died after several cars and a bus were trapped there.</p><p>More dangerous weather is headed for East Asia. Tropical Storm Talim has now strengthened into a typhoon in the South China Sea. It's carrying winds of 120 kilometers per hour, equivalent to a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane. It's expected to make landfall in southern China in the next 24 hours and forecasters warn heavy rainfall could trigger flash flooding and landslides.</p><p>Well, U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, is in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart. They are discussing how to reduce their country's carbon emissions. China and the U.S. are the world's largest carbon polluters, and the backdrop for their talks couldn't be more appropriate. They are meeting in China's capital during the city's hottest ever recorded summer.</p><p>And Anna Coren joins me now from Hong Kong with more on this. Good to see you, Anna. So, what all does John Kerry and his team hope to achieve during his Beijing trip on climate change?</p><p>Ann Coren, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rosemary, I think there is real commitment on both sides, you know, to get momentum back on track regarding climate talks. John Kerry has just wrapped up a four-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua. We are waiting for readouts from both sides, but its length certainly suggest that they had a lot to discuss.</p><p>You know, China and the U.S., the world's two largest economies, they are also the world's two biggest emitters accounting for 40 percent of global emissions.</p><p>[02:09:58]</p><p>So, there needs to be cooperation and a concerted effort to drastically cut fossil fuel production to make an impact on climate change and obviously lead the world by example. Climate talks came to a standstill last August, Rosemary, after the then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Beijing severed talks in protest. But as we have seen, there have been a slew of high-level U.S.-China meetings in the past months to improve this bilateral relationship starting with the U.S. Secretary of State, then the Treasury Secretary, and now U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, in Beijing.</p><p>Now, Kerry and Xie, they have a history. They worked together in 2021 for COP26 in Glasgow where they made some real progress. Then they met on the sidelines of COP27 in Egypt last year. January of this year, they had a video talk. And it would suggest that communications have continued despite the strained relationship.</p><p>So, this face-to-face meeting between the two men very important. It's about resuming the joint working group on climate cooperation before COP28, which will happen at the end of November in Dubai. And Kerry has said it's imperative that China and the U.S. make real progress in the next four months.</p><p>Let me read to you what Kerry also said about these meetings in Beijing. He said, \"In the next three days we hope we can begin taking some big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the U.S. to address the common risk, threat, challenge, to all of humanity created by humans themselves.\" Kerry we'll meet with other Chinese officials over the next few days and possibly, Rosemary, even Xi Jinping. Kerry met with Xi when he was U.S. Secretary of State under Barack Obama, and experts believe that a meeting of Xi and Kerry would send an important signal of Beijing's commitment to tackling global warming, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: All right there. Thanks to Anna Coren joining us live from Hong Kong. Appreciate it.</p><p>Well, smoke from Canadian wildfires is causing more problems for the U.S. The National Weather Service in central Illinois posted this photo showing how the skies darkened dramatically over the weekend. The situation has been made worse over the past week with nearly 400 new fires in British Columbia. A firefighter died Thursday responding to a blaze there.</p><p>Smoke from those wildfires is triggering alerts in at least 11 states across the northern U.S. Air quality health advisories are being issued Monday for the entire state of New York.</p><p>Well, one of the greatest football stars of his generation has been formally introduced to his new fans in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Lionel Andres Messi!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Despite a two-hour rain delay, Lionel Messi was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd at an Inter Miami introductory celebration Sunday, including a team co-owner David Beckham, a former world class player himself, of course. Messi's first met with Inter Miami takes place this Friday. The 36-year-old Argentine joined the team as a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner. Messi's deal runs through the end of the 2025 season and will pay up to $60 million a year.</p><p>And world number one Carlos Alcaraz says winning Wimbledon is a dream come true. The Spaniard beat reigning champion, Novak Djokovic, in a thrilling five set men's final on Sunday. Alcaraz prevailed after nearly five hours on center court. The 20-year-old becomes the third youngest Wimbledon champion in the open era.</p><p>Well, there is an emergency right now on the bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia that's damaged the span and reportedly killed at least two people. We will have a live update on what made have caused it. That's coming up.</p><p>And this emergency comes as Vladimir Putin ponders whether to extend an expiring grain deal that's critical to Ukraine and many countries around the world. We'll explain what's at stake and why the Russian president is holding out. Back in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:15:00]</p><p>CHURCH: Two blasts, a girl injured, her parents killed. A roadway damaged and traffic at a standstill. These are the various reports we are getting, at this hour, about an emergency on the bridge connecting Crimea with the Russian mainland.</p><p>Multiple, unconfirmed reports indicate two explosions rocked the Kerch bridge just after 3:00 a.m. local time Monday. Officials say some of the roadway was damaged and traffic, including cars and trains, has been halted. The governor of Russia's Belgorod region says a girl was injured and her parents killed in a car on the bridge. There is no confirmation yet on what may have caused all of this.</p><p>And, to the west, the last Ukrainian ship protected under the Black Sea Grain Deal with Russia has left the port of Odessa. That deal, which allows safe passage for Ukrainian grain, will expire later today unless Russia extends it. President Vladimir Putin has complained the agreement is unfair to Russia, but he has still agreed to previous extensions, despite threatening to pull out of the deal.</p><p>The U.N. has offered Russia some financial concessions, but it's not clear if Putin will accept them this time. And CNN's Scott McLean is tracking all of this from London and has the latest for us. He joins us live. Good to see you, Scott. So, what more are you learning about these explosions hitting Crimea's Kerch bridge? Russia calling this an emergency situation.</p><p>SCOT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, again, Rosemary, we have unconfirmed reports that there were two explosions, about six hours ago, so 3:00 a.m. local time and they are about 15 minutes apart or so. We have not got official confirmation from the Russian side, but what the Russian Ministry of Transport has confirmed is that the bridge has been damaged. Spans of the bridge, they say, have been damaged and officials right now are inspecting the bridge.</p><p>[02:20:01]</p><p>Officials have also confirmed though that there were Ukrainian drone attacks on the city of Sebastopol, this is on the other side of the Crimean Peninsula. So, again, not near the bridge, but certainly there has been incoming into Ukraine overnight.</p><p>Now, the Ukrainian's have not taken responsibility for either, but the Ukrainian intelligence has said that this will make it more difficult for the Russians on the battlefield. They have also said, quote, \"that the bridge is an unstable structure.\" Now, of course, it is not only strategically important for the Russians to get supplies into the civilian population of Crimea, but also potentially for the war effort as well.</p><p>But it is also symbolically important because it is the only link between Russia proper and the illegally annexed territory of Crimea, which was taken by the Russians in 2014. In fact, Vladimir Putin himself, when the bridge opened in 2018, was on hand for the official opening driving across the bridge himself. It has also been targeted before. It was just earlier this month that the Russians say that it intercepted a Ukrainian cruise missile, causing the bridge to be closed for some time, causing traffic backlogs.</p><p>And of course, in October of last year as well, a truck carrying explosives detonated on that bridge causing huge damage. It was in December that Putin actually personally visited the bridge to oversee the rebuilding process. It February that the bridge reopened to traffic and the train part of the bridge, which carries freight and passengers, that was set to reopen last month. Obviously now, there are going to be more problems getting across that bridge, Rosemary. The extent of the damage though, obviously, we still don't know.</p><p>CHURCH: Of course. And Scott, what is the latest on the Ukraine grain deal that is set to expire midnight Monday and how likely is it that Russia will renew this agreement?</p><p>MCLEAN: Yeah. Frankly, things are not looking good. Case in point, last month, a Ukrainian diplomat said she was 99.9 percent sure that Russia would not renew that deal. Obviously, the deal has helped to stabilize global food prices because Ukraine is such a big exporter of grain. On Saturday, Vladimir Putin told South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that the deal has not been living up to its objectives.</p><p>And the crux of the deal is, essentially, is that Russia allows free passage of the Ukrainian grain to get out of the country via ship on the Black Sea in exchange, in part, for help from the U.N. to help its grain and its fertilizer get to market. Now, it's grain and its fertilizer, Russian grain and fertilizer, is not subject to any international sanctions, but complicating things is the fact that Russian banks are largely sanctioned and disconnected from international payment systems.</p><p>And so, the U.N. has offered to connect one bank or remove barriers for the Russian agricultural bank. It's not clear whether the Russians are in the mood to accept that kind of a deal. Obviously, the ball is in their court. And one other thing, quickly, is that, of course, Ukraine does have other options to get grain out of the country, but the difficulty going via rail through Europe is that the gauge of the tracks in Ukraine and Europe are actually different so, it causes a huge logistical issue to actually transfer the cargo from one train to another once it gets to the border with Poland, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Scott McLean joining us live from London. Still to come, a suspect arrested and charged in the cold case of the Gilgo Beach murders. What a top investigator had to say about the alleged killing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:25:00]</p><p>CHURCH: A top investigator on the long, unsolved case of the Gilgo Beach murders says it's possible that there may be more victims. New York architect, Rex Heuermann, is charged with the murders of three women over a decade ago. He was arrested on Thursday in midtown Manhattan, about 40 miles from where the victims remain were discovered on Gilgo Beach in Long Island in 2010. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty. The case is tied to at least 10 sets of human remains which were found in the area. Heuermann is also the prime suspect in a fourth murder. One official said he is alleged acts were the worst he had ever seen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY CARTER, SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPUTY POLICE COMMISSIONER: I knew that this person was a demon. And the fact that we are able to bring some closure and some peace to the families as well as take a violent person off of the streets is rewarding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Joining me now from Brooklyn, New York, is Robert Kolker. He is the \"New York Times\" bestselling author of \"Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery\" about the Gilgo Beach murders.\" Bob, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ROBERT KOLKER, AUTHOR, LOST GIRLS: AN UNSOLVED AMERICAN MYSTERY: Thank you.</p><p>CHURCH: So, you have followed the Gilgo Beach killings for more than a decade and, as I just mentioned, wrote a book about the case. What was your reaction to news on Friday that an arrest had been made of a suspect in this case, 16 years after multiple women were found dead in that area?</p><p>KOLKER: Well, it's simply a stunning development. I think what people who are unfamiliar with this case might need to understand is that it has been 12 years, not just without any promising leads, but with no declared persons of interests, no suspects, no arrests, and barely a peep from the police or the authorities, except perhaps identifying another victim or releasing a small piece of evidence for information.</p><p>There has been practically nothing, and now suddenly to have this, a suspect who has been hiding in plain sight the entire time, a suspect with 92 gun permits, it's simply stunning.</p><p>CHURCH: Yeah. Let's look at that because the suspect, we are looking at the photograph there, Rex Heuermann, is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to the charges.</p><p>[02:30:05]</p><p>He appears to have been living, as you say, in plain sight in a Long Island town not far from where the bodies were found. Why do you think it took so long to find this suspect, a family man, very well educated with a high-profile job?</p><p>KOLKER: He fits the profile in so many ways. He's lives in this centrally located town in Long Island, that's a short drive from where the human remains were first found. He commutes into Manhattan which is where some of the phone cell signals got pings from. So, we think that, you know, perhaps it matches up that way. On the other hand, he has this public facing job. A job where he is very visible. He's dealing with architecture clients all the time, perhaps high-profile people. So, it's hard to imagine somebody like that thinking that they can stay below radar forever. The fact that he stayed below radar this long, has everything to do with problems with the Suffolk County Police. Problems with the Suffolk County D.A., institutional apathy about this case from the very beginning.</p><p>Cooperation problems with the FBI. And frankly, there was a long period where there was corruption that was keeping the FBI out of this case.</p><p>CHURCH: Right. And I wanted to ask you why these murdered women were viewed by the public as prostitutes and worthless from the very beginning and what changed that perception slowly over the years.</p><p>KOLKER: In my book Lost Girls, I try not just to profile the women who were victims in this case, but also their families. It's really a portrait of five families. And these families are all families that were in crisis in different ways, from parts of America, where financial opportunities have been narrowing for generations. And then the internet comes along and disrupts everything, and provides an irresistible way to make quick money for people who otherwise might be working at minimum wage jobs or perhaps going nowhere in their lives.</p><p>So, it was a tool of social mobility for a lot of these women. The problem is that our society made them vulnerable. They were overlooked when they went missing, their disappearances weren't taken seriously by the authorities. Some of them never got on to the official registry of missing persons that the United States has because they were escorts. And then once their bodies were found, the police didn't want to take the case as seriously as they might have otherwise, that these women were college students perhaps or, you know, corporate employees.</p><p>Instead, they told the public that it was the constellation, that the killer was only targeting women like this. It really is a textbook case in why women like this get overlooked and why serial killers target women like this because they know they'll be overlooked. It was a tragedy back then it's really quite, quite a positive development that things have changed a little bit now.</p><p>CHURCH: And Bob, why did you decide to write about this case in your book Lost Girls? A best seller that was actually later adapted into a movie.</p><p>KOLKER: I think, to me, the best True Crime books don't just offer you, you know, thrills and plot twists. They also lift the veil on a part of the world and part of society that you might otherwise never get to see. The thing about crime stories is that worlds collide and claim stories. The rich and the poor, collide, law enforcement bump up against people who are living off the grid.</p><p>And we learned something about ourselves as a society about who becomes vulnerable. Lost Girls is a social issues book as much as it is a crime story. And mostly it's a book about families and about people who become vulnerable and why they become vulnerable. CHURCH: Bob Kolker, thank you so much for shining some light on this and for joining us. We appreciate it.</p><p>KOLKER: Thank you very much.</p><p>CHURCH: In Georgia, a gunman accused of fatally shooting four people in an Atlanta suburb was killed in a shootout with police. Authorities say Andre Longmore died during a confrontation Sunday that also left two officers injured one of them seriously. The shooting Saturday sparked a manhunt across North Georgia. The motive for the shooting is still unclear, but officials say the gunman was not related to any of the victims.</p><p>Still to come. New economic data out of Beijing shows a bounce back from COVID-19 may have run its course. We'll break down the numbers. That and more after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:37:48]</p><p>CHURCH: New data out of Beijing shows China's economy is slow to less than one percent growth in the second quarter of this year. The National Bureau of Statistics released those figures just hours ago. And here's a look at how the Asia markets are faring right now. You can see there. All errors in negative territory. And China's slowdown comes after a better showing at the start of the year.</p><p>Beijing saw more than two percent growth in the first quarter when the economy began to shake off the effects of years of pandemic restrictions. But the post-COVID recovery has quickly faltered as Chinese exports fell the most in three years due to lower demand.</p><p>And CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now from Hong Kong with more on this. Good to see you, Kristie. So, walk us through the data and what it says about the pace of China's economic recovery after COVID.</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, China's economic growth is losing momentum. Growth is stronger if you compare it to last year when zero COVID lockdowns gripped the country. But the pace of economic recovery is slowing down and adding to this negative economic picture. We've also learned today that China's youth unemployment rate has hit another record high of 21.3 percent in June.</p><p>So, the pressure is on Beijing to come up and to roll out some more stimulus measures. Now according to official data that was released earlier today. China's GDP grew 6.3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, but it grew only 0.8 percent from April to June. And according to economist Carol Kong, she says this. \"The data suggests that China's post-COVID Boom is clearly over. The higher frequency indicators are up from maize numbers but still paint a picture of a bleak and faltering recovery. And at the same time, youth unemployment is hitting record highs.\"</p><p>Economists say that China is counting the cost of weak demand both at home and overseas. Data that was released last week showed that China's exports fell, their fastest pace in three years in June. And an additional factor is the so-called scarring effects of zero COVID. You know, that time of deep uncertainty, it caused consumers and businesses to save more instead of going out to purchase more and making new buys and investments.</p><p>[02:40:09]</p><p>Now looking ahead, investors, economists are looking towards this expected Politburo meeting that's taking place at the end of the month. The government has promised to make stimulating consumer spending a top priority. Back to you, Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: All right. Kristie Lu Stout joining us live from Hong Kong. Many things. Well, in just a few hours, tickets go on sale for select dates of Taylor Swift's U.K. tour. The singer has scheduled multiple shows in the U.K. next year with staggered ticket drops all this week to avoid another ticket master crash. Early U.S. sales were impacted by Web site problems prompting an investigation by the U.S. government. Similar issues affected sales in France earlier this month.</p><p>And thanks so much for joining us. I'm Rosemary Church. For our international viewers, World Sport is coming up next. And for those of you here in the United States and in Canada, I'll be back with more CNN NEWSROOM after a short break. Do stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:45:29]</p><p>CHURCH: Welcome back to our viewers in North America. I'm Rosemary Church. Well, much of Hollywood has gone dark and made a push from unions representing actors, writers and others who have gone on strike. The Actors Union SAG-AFTRA joined the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines last week, adding thousands more voices to the cause including many A-list celebrities.</p><p>They're fighting the major movie studios and streaming platforms for better pay residuals, benefits and protections over the use of artificial intelligence. The group representing the studios says it's already presented a new deal offering \"historic pay and residual increases acclaim SAG-AFTRA has refuted.</p><p>And for more, I'm joined now by Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. The national executive director and chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA. Appreciate you joining us.</p><p>DUNCAN CRABTREE-IRELAND, NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, SAG-AFTRA: Oh, it's a pleasure to be with you.</p><p>CHURCH: Wonderful. So, at the center of this writers and actors strike is, of course, this disparity in pay and access to streaming profits, reduced residuals and concerns about the negative impact of artificial intelligence on the industry. Let's start by focusing on that last issue. What are the main concerns for Actors and Writers about how A.I. might negatively impact the industry? CRABTREE-IRELAND: Yes. Really, it's more of a question about their personal rights. And I think this is a question that resonates probably with all of us, not only our members, but the idea that a big corporation could essentially use their economic power to force you to give them the right to control your image, your likeness, your voice, create digital replicas of you and then have that digital double go out and act as though it's you when it's not really you doing it.</p><p>That's the kind of thing -- that's the kind of technological development that needs to have some fences around it. And those fences are very straightforward. It's informed consent so that any performer or really any person who is going to have that done with their -- with their image, their persona has the right to understand what the use is going to be and consent to it. And then also fair compensation for that.</p><p>But we haven't been able to get the companies to step up and really agree to provide a full informed consent and fair compensation. And that is absolutely essential. Our members won't make a deal without it.</p><p>CHURCH: So, what proposal was offered by the T.V. and film studios to help limit the use of A.I.? And why did Writers and Actors reject that proposal?</p><p>CRABTREE-IRELAND: Well, sure. In the -- in the Writers negotiations, according -- I wasn't part of those negotiations. But according to what they put out, what was offered was an annual meeting for them to discuss the issues. In our negotiations, we had very specific proposals on the table from us and the companies responded to them. But the devil is in the details. So, for example, in one of those proposals, they responded by saying that background performers could be engaged to work for one day in one day's pay.</p><p>And then the company would own the digital replica of them and be able to use it in any future project for the rest of eternity, with no additional consent and no additional compensation. That is not the kind of deal that any person much less than the performer would accept.</p><p>CHURCH: So, the T.V. and film studios say that they offered the highest pay increase in 35 years, residual increases. And this proposal we've just discussed to limit the impact of artificial intelligence. But clearly you, the Actors and Writers don't agree. So, what would an acceptable deal look like that would address all your concerns? If you can break that down, what are you looking for?</p><p>CRABTREE-IRELAND: Sure. We already talked about the A.I. part. When we talk about compensation, what's on the table from us is an 11 percent increase in the first year. That's the only area we're a part on. They're offering five percent in that first year. Five percent of an increase leaves our members working for less in 2023 in real dollar terms than they made in 2020. And their proposal package will leave them still earning less in 2026 than they made in 2020.</p><p>Our members don't think it's OK to go backwards, especially when they're the faces and the voices of the projects that make this business operate. The streaming platforms wouldn't exist without our members. These studios wouldn't exist without our members. And it's not fair while CEO's compensation continues to go up for our members to be falling behind.</p><p>[02:50:06]</p><p>And a five percent increase is really not something that I think they should be trumpeting is the historic greatest increase in 35 years. I mean, if that's the greatest increase you've ever paid your employees in 35 years, that's a -- that says something about you.</p><p>CHURCH: And these T.V. and movie studios say they can't afford any more than this. How would -- what would you say to them on that point when you mention what some of the top guys are earning?</p><p>CRABTREE-IRELAND: Well, I wish I could show you a chart of CEO compensation at these very companies. But I would -- what I would tell you is we're talking eight and nine-figure salaries, you know, if you can afford to pay your CEO at one year more than the entirety of the Writers and Actors request combined that cover tens of thousands of performers and writers, that says something about your company if you think that's an affordable, but it's affordable for you to do that for your CEO.</p><p>The times are changing. Workers are not willing to just listen to companies say, oh, we can't afford it all at the same time. They've got CDOs with multiple yachts. That is not how this industry should operate. And the creativity of our members is why this industry functions. It's why this interview has been successful. And it's the only way it will be successful in the future is to have creative people like our members, writers, directors and others who are engaged in the industry treated respectfully and fairly.</p><p>CHURCH: And just very quickly. I mean, we know that there's a lot of material that they can keep using over and over again. How long could the writers and the actors go on strike for though while that all plays out?</p><p>CRABTREE-IRELAND: Yes, sure. Well, it shouldn't be -- shouldn't distraction have been necessary and we've said we're ready to go back to the table immediately. Tomorrow, we would be there. The company is the studios are the ones saying they're not willing to talk. But our members voted 98 percent to authorize the strike and our members are willing to stay out as long as it takes to get a fair deal. They will not accept a deal that doesn't respect them. And that isn't fair.</p><p>CHURCH: Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, thank you so much for talking with us. Appreciate it.</p><p>CRABTREE-IRELAND: Thank you. Appreciate it.</p><p>CHURCH: Well, U.S. Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal is facing backlash after she called Israel a \"racist state\" during an event over the weekend. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): We have been fighting to make it clear that Israel is a racist state. That the Palestinian people deserve self-determination and autonomy, that the dream -- that the dream of a two-state solution is slipping away from us that it is not -- that it does not even feel possible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: House Democrats were quick to condemn her comments. She issued an apology Sunday saying words do matter. And so, it is important that I clarify my statement. I do not believe the idea of Israel as a nation is racist. These are not easy conversations, but they are important ones if we are ever to move forward. It is in that spirit that I offer my apologies to those who I have hurt with my words and offer this clarification.</p><p>Well, just over an hour from now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will chair a weekly Cabinet meeting one day after being released from the hospital. He was admitted Saturday for what doctors say was dehydration amid an ongoing heatwave in the country. His office says the Prime Minister complained of mild dizziness before being admitted. The doctor says Netanyahu has completed a series of tests and is in excellent condition.</p><p>A kidnapped America and is now back on U.S. soil eight months after she was snatched from a street in Mexico. The FBI says Monica de Leon Barba was walking her dog in Mexico when she was kidnapped. Investigators say the professional photographer was targeted. CNN's Mike Valerio is in Los Angeles with the latest.</p><p>MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that this is the combination of 227 days of teamwork between the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to bring Monica back home to here in California. And when we're talking about who is behind the missing, the kidnapping fires that were sent by -- out by the FBI, Monica de Leon Barbra is a profoundly talented photographer.</p><p>She decided to take a summer job down in Mexico last summer to share her photographic talents work on a few projects, according to her family members. What they've told our partners in San Francisco. So, we moved to a few days after Thanksgiving last year, and she's in the middle of the street in an idyllic beautiful town of Tepatitlan in Mexico, walking her dog and she's kidnapped, she's abducted.</p><p>The FBI says that there are at least five people who kidnap her. Three vehicles that come up next to her and then simply drive away. So, to imagine her family going through the holiday season, New Year's into this year without knowing where she is.</p><p>[02:55:03]</p><p>The captors demanding a ransom and the FBI saying that this was a targeted kidnapping, not random. They were simply beside themselves. Up until this weekend when the FBI releases a statement saying that she had been released writing in part according to the leader of the FBI in San Francisco, \"Our relief and joy at the safe return of Monica is profound. The FBI investigation is far from over, but we can now work this case knowing an innocent victim is reunited with her family.\"</p><p>So, something from that statement between the lines is that the, you know, the FBI is also saying here that suspects have not been identified in this case. That's one of the reasons why the investigation continues here. They also say that no arrests have been made. So that is why the matter is enclosed. But certainly, the most important part of this entire case is that Monica is back with family in California. A reunion that they certainly were hoping for has come to fruition.</p><p>Mike Valerio, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>CHURCH: An update now on a story we are following. It regards the bridge connecting Russian-annexed Crimea to the Russian mainland. We are told -- we told you earlier how Russia's transport ministry said the bridge suffered damage to its spans. This is the first video we've received that appears to show that. Multiple telegram channels reported strikes on the bridge and a local official confirmed at least two deaths.</p><p>Ukraine has not confirmed that it launched a strike. The Russia appointed head of Crimea says an emergency incident has halted traffic on the bridge. The span of course serves as a vital logistical node for Moscow's military in its war against Ukraine. And we will have more in the next hour of CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>And thank you so much for your company. I'm Rosemary Church. I'll be back with more on CNN NEWSROOM. Just after the short break.

We will go live to Rome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia sits quiet after reportedly being hit by some sort of strike, we have a live report from London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is \"CNN Newsroom\" with Rosemary Church.</p><p>Good to have you with us. And we begin with extreme weather that is bringing excessive heat and deadly flooding across the U.S. More than 80 million people are under heat alerts in it least 14 states, stretching from Washington State all the way to Florida. And the relentless blistering temperatures are breaking records by the day. Parts of California, Nevada and Arizona are seeing the mercury shoot well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Meanwhile, it's not excessive heat but too much water that's causing the distress in the northeast. In the past month, parts of New England and other northeastern states has seen 200 to 300 percent of their average monthly rainfall.</p><p>The dome of extremely hot air is what's behind the seemingly never- ending heat wave gripping the Southern and Western U.S. Here is CNN Meteorologist, Brandon Miller, to tell us if there is any relief in sight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRANDON MILLER, CNN METEOROLOGIST: So the question that everyone wants to know is when will the heat wave in the U.S. Southwest break? And the answer is no time soon. These above average temperatures, we put this into motion going through the work week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday into Thursday. They really just expand.</p><p>The high pressure that has been here over the four corners region, near Nevada just sort of drifts a little bit. But that heat dome stays massive and it blocks any of these winds and rain that can cool things off and things are going to stay 10, 15 degrees above average. That is Fahrenheit above average for the next at least week. And we're talking the hottest times of the year.</p><p>So, it's -- take your hottest time of the year and at 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, and that is where we are. Nearly every day this week in Phoenix will be a record high. That's scary. And what's even scarier are the lows, 94, 95, 94. Those would be in the top five to 10 hottest nights Phoenix has ever had, any one of them. And you've got seven in a row. It's been since the last Sunday with the low, dropped below 90.</p><p>So that's a record stretch for them. We're setting records everywhere, Las Vegas, more of the same looking at setting a record and then staying above 110 all week long, again, lows, not dropping down where they should be. That is where heat turns deadly, the next several days here going through actually next weekend.</p><p>Here in the northern plains and even the northeast we've been dealing with a lot of rain. You're dealing with smoke from the Canadian wildfire but we're at least staying out of this record heat wave that shows no signs of breaking in the U.S. Back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Thanks for that. Well, people in Southern Europe are also sweltering with a scorching heat wave coming right in the midst of the busy summer tourist season. On the Spanish island of La Palma, a forest fire is only making matters worse. It's burning out of control, forcing at least 4,000 people to evacuate.</p><p>In Italy, at least one person has died and several tourists have collapsed from the heat. Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, are under extreme health risk because of the heat. And people in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia and Spain are also facing dangerously high temperatures.</p><p>So let's check in with CNN's Barbie Nadeau. She joins us live from Rome. Good morning to you, Barbie. So what is the latest on this record heat wave hitting Italy and of course other parts of Europe?</p><p>[03:05:03]</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, you know, Southern Europe is really, really just getting hotter and hotter. And the next two or three days are expected to be record-breaking. Here in Rome, we could break the record that was set last June that was 40.7 degrees here in the city. They are saying we could head over that today, almost certainly tomorrow where temperatures are actually predicted for the city of Rome to maybe hit 43. It's far worse in southern Italy. In Sicily, they may break a 48.7 record that was up last year. Now, that was extremely hot. And as you said, this is a height of tourist season and you've just got so many people waiting in line under the sun to get into places like the Roman Colloseum behind me. You know, there's free water available to the tourist but it's very, very hot. And authorities are concerned that as the heat wave just progresses it gets hotter and hotter, it's really going to start taking a toll, you know, not just on the tourist but on the Italians alike.</p><p>CHURCH: Yeah, of course. And in the United States we know that the elderly and other vulnerable citizens are often advised to seek out air conditioned centers for relief from the heat. So what are citizens across Italy being told to do at this time?</p><p>NADEAU: Well, you know, these air conditioned centers aren't really a thing here. I would have to say, in Italy, air conditioning is just not -- you know, not every home has air conditioning by any means. So, what you've got is you know, shopping malls and markets and things like that that are air conditioned. So people are trying to take shelter in that, the Italians.</p><p>But one of the big differences here, Rosemary, is that people who are from the Mediterranean, people who lived in Southern Europe, know how to handle the heat. It is always hot here in the summer. So you've got people, Italians, Greeks, Spanish, people are often but much more prepared. They don't go out during the middle of the day. They eat less, they cut down on alcohol.</p><p>These are the sorts of things that tourists don't necessarily do. They're on a holiday. They maybe planned years in advance. You know, they don't want to miss out on any of it. And that's what the authorities are far more concerned about the tourists that are not taking the advice of getting out of the sun in the middle of the day, or staying hydrated.</p><p>And so, the concern in these next couple of days, it's supposed to be very, very hot, that we're going to see some problems. Now, we had several tourists collapsed here in Rome, but there are authorities around to help them. You know, it is just a difficult situation for the authorities to try to manage the people, the citizens, the population and the tourist, and this is the busiest time of the year here in the city like Rome, in Florence, in Sicily, and across Southern Europe. People come here for the sun but maybe not just much of it. Rosemary?</p><p>CHURCH: Absolutely. Barbie Nadeau joining us live from Rome. Many thanks.</p><p>Well, in the northeast, it's not excessive heat but too much heavy rain all at once. Authorities in Pennsylvania are still searching for a two year old and an infant who disappeared in rising floodwaters. The children's mother and four others died.</p><p>CNN's Polo Sandoval has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, here in the U.S., another weekend of deadly weather in the state of Pennsylvania, a massive flash flooding affecting many residents in that state, including one family who was originally from South Carolina that according to officials, they were on their way to a barbecue event when all of a sudden they became trapped in rising floodwaters. The situation for that family, turning deadly according to officials on the ground.</p><p>GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): It is just a devastating blow to this Bucks County community that brings us all here today. I think it's important to know that we are all here today. This is a moment that calls on all of us to come together, to lift up upper bank field (ph) and the Bucks County community. And that is exactly what we are doing.</p><p>On behalf of more than 13 million Pennsylvanians, I want Bucks County to know that we are here with you, we are praying with you, and we will continue to do everything in our power to lift you up.</p><p>SANDOVAL: And in terms of the wider impact, we do understand that there are many airports here in the U.S. that were affected by this wild weekend weather, including at New York's JFK where there was a ground stop that was implemented because of the thunderstorms and also at airport in Boston as well.</p><p>Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Authorities in South Korea say 40 people have now died from flash floods and landslides in the past few days. Thirteen people died in a flooded underpass in Central South Korea.</p><p>Michael Holmes tells us how extreme weather turned an ordinary road journey into tragedy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Working in mud and against the clock, rescuers in South Korea pump water from a flooded tunnel. Arcs of water redirected from the once clogged underpass, revealing some of the vehicles trapped inside.</p><p>Dash cam video shows how quickly the tunnel filled up on Saturday, local authorities say a levee broke after days of heavy rain across the country, sending a rush of water through the underpass, some cars barely escaping the deluge.</p><p>[03:10:06]</p><p>But authorities say 15 vehicles, including a bus, were trapped in a tunnel, along with drivers and passengers. Divers have been painstakingly searching for them and have retrieved multiple bodies from the scene.</p><p>Many family members of those thought to be missing gathered at a nearby hospital, their misery compounded by the agony of a long wait for information. One man says he is speechless and says hasn't eaten for hours while waiting for authorities to brief him.</p><p>The tragedy has shocked South Korea, some people saying the government should have been better prepared after last year's torrential rains, which were the worst in 115 years.</p><p>One man, who lives near the tunnel, says authorities should have closed it when flooding was expected. He says that he feels like this could have easily happened to him and he feels like part of himself died too.</p><p>Heavy monsoon rains have caused dozens of deaths, not just in the tunnel, but across the country. Thousands of people forced to evacuate because of floods and landslides. In some areas, riverbanks completely collapsed because of saturated ground, and meteorologists warned that it could get worse with as much as 300 millimeters of additional rain forecasted to fall in some parts of the country over the next few days.</p><p>Other parts of Asia are also dealing with intense weather. Southern China bracing for a powerful storm, which is expected to lash the area with strong winds and heavy rains in the next few days. And parts of New Delhi are still water logged, even though water levels in the Yamuna River, which flooded the city, have receded. But the water has not drained away yet, creating very wet and frustrating circumstances for people just trying to move about the city.</p><p>Michael Holmes, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart. They're discussing how to reduce their countries carbon admissions. China and the U.S. are the world's largest carbon polluters. And the backdrop for their talks could not be more appropriate. They're meeting during Beijing's hottest ever reported summer.</p><p>Anna Coren joins me now live from Hong Kong, good to see you Anna. So, what all those John Kerry and his team hope to achieve on the Beijing trip?</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, they definitely want commitment from China to get climate talks back on track. And I think that's what we are seeing. John Kerry earlier wrapped up a four-hour meeting with the Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua. We are still waiting for a readout from that meeting from both sides, but the length of it suggests that they had a lot to discuss.</p><p>You know, China and the, U.S., as you say the world's two largest economies, the world's two largest emitters. They accounted for 40 percent of global emission. So, there needs to be cooperation and a concerted effort to drastically cut fossil fuel production to make an impact on climate change and to lead by example. Climate talks, Rosemary, came to a still, August last year when then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Beijing severed talks in protests. But there have been a slew of high-level U.S.-China meetings that was seen in the past months to try and improve this bilateral relationship.</p><p>The U.S. Secretary of State, then the Treasury Secretary, now U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry. Kerry and Xie, they have you know, history. They worked together for COP 26 and Glasgow back in 2021. And they did make progress and there was hope.</p><p>They met on the sidelines of COP 27 in Egypt last year. In January this year, they talked via video conference. You know, communications have continued despite the strained relations. And obviously, this face to face meeting that they have this morning, you know, it's about resuming the joint working group on climate cooperation before that big meeting, COP 28, in Dubai, which starts at the end of November. Kerry said it was imperative that China and the U.S. make real progress in the next four months.</p><p>Now let me read to you what John Kerry also said. He said, in the next three days we hope we can begin taking some big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the U.S. to address a common risk, threat, challenge to all of humanity created by humans themselves.</p><p>Kerry will no doubt meet with other Chinese officials, possibly even Xi Jinping. Kerry met with Xi when he was U.S. Secretary of State under Barack Obama. And experts believe that if this meeting takes place, it will certainly send an important signal of Beijing's commitment to tackling global warning. Rosemary?</p><p>CHURCH: All right, our thanks to Anna Coren. Joining us live from Hong Kong.</p><p>[03:15:01]</p><p>Well a two-hour rain delay could not dampen enthusiasm as Miami welcomed one of the greatest football stars of his generation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN: Lionel Andres Messi.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Lionel Messi was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of an Inter Miami introductory celebration on Sunday, including team co-owner, David Beckham, a former world class player himself of course.</p><p>Messi's first match with Inter Miami takes place this Friday. The 36- year-old Argentine joins the team as a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner. Messi's deal runs through the end of the 2025 season and will pay up to $60 million a year.</p><p>A world number one, Carlos Alcaraz, says winning Wimbledon is a dream come true. The Spaniard defeated reigning champion, Novak Djokovic, in a thrilling five-set men's final on Sunday. Alcaraz prevailed after nearly five hours on center court. The 20-year-old becomes the third youngest Wimbledon champion in the open-era. After winning, Alcaraz paid tribute to Djokovic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLOS ALCARAZ, 2023 WIMBLEDON GENTLEMEN SINGLE'S CHAMPION: I started playing tennis, watching you -- I mean, since I was born, you know, you're already in the winning tournament, you know it's amazing, proud of you, but I would say that me -- you say -- you just say that 36 is the new 26 and you made that happened in real. You know, it's amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: Well there is an emergency right now on the bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia. New video appears to show the span is damaged. And at least two people have reportedly been killed. We will have a live update on what may have cost this.</p><p>Plus, Iran's controversial morality police are backed to enforcing the hijab for women, but some are already pushing back. That and more in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:20:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHURCH: New video into CNN appears to show damage to the Kerch Bridge, the main link between the Russian-occupied Crimea and the Russian mainland.</p><p>Multiple Telegram channels reported strikes on the bridge a few hours ago, and a local official confirmed at least two deaths. Ukraine has not confirmed it launched a strike. The Russia appointed head of Crimea says an emergency incident has halted road traffic on the bridge, but Russian reports say rail service continues though with delays. The span serves as a vital logistical route for Moscow's military in its war against Ukraine.</p><p>And CNN's Scott McLean is tracking all of this for us from London. He joins us now live. Good morning to you, Scott. So, what more are you learning about what happened to Crimea's Kerch Bridge?</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Rosemary. Yeah, so a Crimean official says that this is a terrorist attack, in his words, carried out by Ukraine, suggesting that there will be retaliatory strikes carried out by Russia.</p><p>He also said, as you mentioned, that the bridge is divided into two parts. There's the part that carries trains and then there's the part that carries vehicle traffic, and the road part of the bridge has been damaged, but the train section has not. And for evidence of that, you have to look at the new video that were seeing, that appears to be taken from the inside of a train car alongside that bridge.</p><p>And you could see it in the video, it seems like one of the sections or one of the spans is partly dislodged from the pillars in the Black Sea there. Now, what you don't see in this video or others is any kind of an impact crater on the surface of the bridge, so it is not entirely clear where or by what caused the actual impact on this bridge.</p><p>The Ukrainians have not directly claimed responsibility but the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, has heavily hinted that they were in fact behind this attack. It should also mention that Russian officials are saying that at least, the early numbers suggest that two people were killed and one person was injured. This was a family traveling together in a car. The parents apparently were killed. The girl survived but is injured.</p><p>This bridge, obviously, has targeted -- has been targeted before. And that's of course because it's not only strategically important, it's symbolically important for Russia, which illegally annexed Crimea back in 2014 and then spent years bringing this bridge. And then in 2018, when it opened, it was Vladimir Putin himself who actually was on hand for the official opening.</p><p>And in terms of it being targeted, it was just earlier this month that Russia said that the Ukrainian cruise missile targeted the bridge that shot it down, but it caused the bridge to actually be closed for sometime, causing traffic jams. And of course, as we know, in October of last year, it was hit by a truck carrying explosives which detonated on the bridge, causing huge damage on both the roadside and the rail side.</p><p>It wasn't until February of this year that the rail side -- or that the roadside completely reopened and then the rail side was supposed to be completely fixed by June last month. Obviously, there's going to be issues now with the roadside. We don't know how long it might take the Russians to actually repair that bridge. Rosemary?</p><p>CHURCH: And Scott, what is the latest on the Ukraine grain deal that is set to expire midnight, Monday, of course? And how likely is it that Russia will renew that deal?</p><p>[03:24:37]</p><p>MCLEAN: If you ask a Ukrainian diplomat last month, she will tell you that she is 99 percent sure that the Russians will not renew this deal. Frankly, things are not looking good. On Saturday, President Vladimir Putin spoke with South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and told them that look, the deal is not meeting its objectives.</p><p>And part of the crux of the deal is essentially that Russia agreed to allow the Ukrainian ships carrying grain to leave port and go to market in exchange for -- in exchange for the U.N. helping Russia get its own grain, and get its own get its own fertilizer to market.</p><p>Now, sanctions on Russia don't actually impact directly grain or fertilizer from Russia. But obviously, they impact the banking system. And so, the Russians seem to indicate that not enough has been done to help them on that.</p><p>And so, a U.N. proposal suggested that the Russians could be reconnected through their agricultural bank in order to satisfy their concerns. But again, the ball is really in the Russians' court. And we haven't seen many indications that the Russians' plan to extend this grain deal. This would be for the fourth time now, Rosemary?</p><p>CHURCH: All right. Our thanks to Scott McLean, joining us live from London.</p><p>Iran is cracking down on women's freedoms, yet again. State media report the country's so-called morality police have resumed controversial patrols to impose the country strict Islamic dress code, including the hijab. Officials say those who don't comply may face illegal action. Some women though are pushing back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNKNOWN (through translator): Do you think the morality police can prevent women from not wearing a hijab? They cannot impose it like before. The number of people who do not obey is too high now. They cannot handle all of us. The last thing they could do is use violence and force against us. They cannot do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: The move comes ten months after Mahsa Amini who died in police custody after she was detained for allegedly not wearing her hijab correctly.</p><p>Well, coming up, here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" millions of people in the United States are suffering from painfully high temperatures and the dangerous heat is not going away anytime soon. We will show you how people are coping.</p><p>Plus, a suspect arrested and charged in the cold case of the Gilgo beach murders, what a top investigator has to say about the alleged killer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:30:00]</p><p>CHURCH: Let's get back to one of our top stories now, extreme heat and deadly flooding across the United States. More than 80 million people are under heat alerts in about a dozen states from Florida in the southeast all the way from Washington State in the northwest.</p><p>Flood watches are still ineffective for more than 3 million across the northeast. Some people will get a break from the rain today but more rain is expected on Tuesday. At least five people died in floodwaters in Pennsylvania and two children are still missing.</p><p>At least 35 U.S. cities hit record high temperatures on Sunday. Many of them are in the southwest with a heat blistering. Las Vegas saw 116 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tucson, Arizona suffered a high of 111 degrees.</p><p>As Rafael Romo reports, there doesn't appear to be much relief in sight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The heat wave is not over yet. An excessive heat warning remains in effect for parts of Arizona, California and Nevada. The National Weather Service says the dangerously hot afternoons with little overnight relief expected adding that this will result in a major to extreme risk of heat related illness for much of the population. Here at Hoover Dam, high temperatures were well over 110 degrees during the weekend and are expected to remain there during the week.</p><p>(voice-over): Earlier, I spoke with the rangers at Death Valley National Park in California, also known as the hottest place on earth, and he told us that what worries them is that this extreme weather seems to be a trend instead of a single occurrence.</p><p>MATT LAMAR, DEATH VALLEY PARK RANGER: What we're seeing here in Death Valley is certainly that things are getting hotter. Seven over 10 hottest summers have come in the last ten years and that's, you know, obviously a global turn.</p><p>ROMO (on camera): The extreme temperatures here at Hoover Dam are not stopping tours from visiting this model of engineering. I earlier spoke with two tourists from St. Louis, who shared with us what they're doing to cope with the heat.</p><p>UNKNOWN: It feels like you're actually on fire after you're out here for a while. And (inaudible) I just slammed about two bottles of water at lunch. It's definitely touching surfaces. And I'm not used to burning myself on concrete.</p><p>UNKNOWN: It's not all that bad, but it's just harder to breathe. Like without the moisture in the air, it's just kind of hard to breathe, you know. So it makes things a little difficult.</p><p>ROMO (voice-over): We spent the last couple of days in Las Vegas, where people were wondering if the all-time record of 117 degrees was going to be broken. The temperatures fall short, but not by much. The National Weather Service says that this heat wave is not typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures and warm nights. They also say that everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert.</p><p>Rafael Romo, CNN, at the Hoover Dam at the border between Arizona and Nevada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: In Georgia, a gunman accused of fatally accusing for people in Atlanta was killed in a shootout with police.

By utilizing collective investigative measures, we were able to strike this suspect over to 138 in Mt. Zion Parkway where they engaged with the suspect.

And the fact that we are able to bring some closure and some peace to the families as well as take a violent person off of the street is rewarding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: nd earlier, I spoke to Bob Kolker, who wrote a book about the murder, and I asked for his reaction to the suspect being arrested.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT KOLKER, AUTHOR, \"LOST GIRLS, AN UNSOLVED AMERICAN MYSTERY\": It's been 12 years, not just without any promising leads but with no declared person of interest, no suspects, no arrest and barely a peep from the police or the authorities except perhaps identifying another victim or releasing a small piece of evidence for information. There has been practically nothing. And now, suddenly, they have this, a suspect who has been hiding in plain sight the entire time, a suspect with 92 gun permits. It's simply stunning.</p><p>CHURCH: Why do you think it took so long to find the suspect, a family man, very well educated with a high-profile job? KOLKER: He fits the profile in so many ways. He lives in a centrally located town in Long Island that's a short drive from where the human remains were first found. He commits into Manhattan, which is where some of the cell-and-cell signals got pinged from. So we think that, you know, perhaps in matches up that way.</p><p>On the other hand, he has this public facing job, a job where he is very visible. He's dealing with architecture clients all the time, perhaps high-profile people. So, it's hard to imagine people like that thinking that they could stay below radar forever.</p><p>CHURCH: I wanted to ask you why these murdered women were viewed by the public as prostitutes and worthless from the very beginning and what changed that perception slowly over the years?</p><p>KOLKER: In my book, \"Lost Girls,\" I try not just to profile the women who were victims in the case but also their families. It's really a portrait of five families. And these families were all families that were in crisis in different ways from parts of America where financial opportunities had been narrowing for generations. And then the Internet comes along and disrupts everything and provides an irresistible way to make quick money for people who, otherwise, maybe working at minimum wage jobs or perhaps going nowhere in their lives.</p><p>So it was a tool of social mobility for a lot of these women. And the problem is that the society made them vulnerable. They were overlooked when they met missing. Their disappearance weren't taken seriously by the authorities. Some of them never got onto the official registry of missing persons that the United States has because they were escorts. And then once their bodies were found, the police did not want to take the cases seriously, as they might have otherwise been as they were college students, perhaps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: A kidnapped American is on her way home eight months after she was snatched from a street in Mexico.

It is not clear what caused this.</p><p>And we're also keeping an eye on the Black Sea grain deal which expires at midnight local time. The agreement has enabled ships to safely export Ukrainian grain to Africa and other regions. But Russian President Vladimir Putin has to agree to an extension today and there is no guaranteeing he will do that.</p><p>Well, a blatant propaganda campaign is underway in schools across Russia to build support for what Mr. Putin calls his special military operation. It shows how far the Kremlin will go to stamp out domestic resistance to the war.</p><p>And CNN's Clare Sebastian has been following the story. She joins me now. So, Clare, Russia attempting to get rid of any dissent against the Putin regime and, of course, its war in Ukraine and they're saying this in the classroom. What is the strategy exactly?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Rosemary. The strategy is to reach a large and impressionable audience with this patriotic pro-war message as quickly and as cheaply as possible. We saw these efforts in schools as soon as the war starts, attempting to instill ever increasing levels of patriotism. But as the war has dragged into its second year, we're seeing these efforts step up.</p><p>And now, that many families in Russia are paying the price. The Kremlin isn't ignoring these deaths. In fact, they're trying to make a patriotic virtue out of them and doing so in the classrooms take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): They're marching not perfectly in time.

Information so tightly controlled, he says multiple teachers have been fired, some even fined for speaking up, a fate that Olga, I teacher in St. Petersburg -- we've changed a name and disguised her identity for safety reasons -- narrowly avoided.</p><p>OLGA, RUSSIAN TEACHER: I have also tried to convince my colleagues that our country has committed a crime. One week later, the director of the school invited me to talk and she warned me that if I continue, then she will have to appeal to a special body of the state. She meant FSB.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And then there are the not so certain curriculum changes. This video of the Crimean bridge, part of a new state controlled weekly lesson series launched last year's called Conversations About Important Things.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): It's not just a transport crossing, the speaker explains, but a spiritual crossing. No mention of the huge explosion that caused parts of the bridge to collapse a few months earlier.</p><p>History is being re-written in the textbooks. This will now include the so-called special military operation. And it is not just recent history.</p><p>KEN: It is a historic fact that Russian state be began with Kyiv, the Kyivskaya Russia, so to say. But nowadays, the new textbooks of history are issued where this idea is removed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Scenes like this at a school in Crimea will also likely become much more common. Basic military preparation, a throwback to Soviet times, set to officially re-enter the school curriculum for older classes.</p><p>KEN (through translator): It is a cheap, simple method of reaching a very large audience and to get across the government's position. It is, in essence, moral violence against children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry Of Education for comment on the purpose of these changes and have gotten a response. Sitting at these hero desks in many schools a reward for only the best students, a morbid incentive designed to create a generation patriotic enough to accept a war whose consequences they are sure to inherit.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on-camera): Rosemary, somewhat ironic, given the pressure that teachers are clearly under this year, 2023, has been named the year of the teacher and mentor in Russia. President Putin marked the occasion back in March by congratulating teachers on raising what he called, defenders of the fatherland, fighting against those, who he said, were trying to deprive Russia of its histories and traditions. The strategy is to openly make teachers in schools and stakeholders in this world to breathe support for the war. In that way, you could see by the volume of social media post open sort of publishing of their efforts to do so, that schools under this pressure are trying to make it very clear that they're telling the sign. Rosemary?</p><p>CHURCH: All right, Clare Sebastian. Many thanks for that report. Still to come, a dance star popular in Latin America is finding event in an unexpected place, Nigeria.

Baker's bizarre relationship with Megan Fox has in many ways stolen the spotlight, a relationship which the actress once labeled a connection of \"mythic proportions,\" akin to a \"tsunami or a forest fire.\" After reports emerged that Fox and Baker drank each other's blood following their engagement last January, the pair might seem akin to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee and actress Pamela Anderson in their unsettling brand of outrageousness. But despite Baker's nosedive from rap to pop-punk on his 2020 album, Tickets to My Downfall, these rockstar comparisons have not exactly been earned.</p><p>On mainstream sellout, an unexciting and repetitive second attempt at encapsulating the style of early 2000s pop-punk, Baker sounds more like a blink-182 cover band rather than an emerging voice in the genre. Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker's major production credits on Tickets to My Downfall and mainstream sellout might explain this ill-fated foray into emo nostalgia best.</p><p>On the opener, \"born with horns,\" Baker barrels into the project with a three-chord melody and vocals saturated in the whiny angst of a classic pop-punk accent. Halfway through the track, the rapid drum beats falter and synthy strings emerge in a moment of apparent contemplation. Baker sings, \"Price you pay for entertaining / Can't decide what is fake / Mercury is retrograding,\" a moment that kick-starts a chain of fake-deep musings that continues for the rest of the album.</p><p>\"die in california\" banks on similar themes of rocky adjustments to fame and Hollywood superficiality, this time with a strange cacophony of features from Young Thug, Gunna and Landon Barker, Travis Barker's 18-year-old son. Baker once again serves up empty criticisms of wealth and stardom, singing, \"I'm miserable even though I made it / Got a house in the Hills and I fuckin' hate it.\" The song's generic hip-hop beat and lackluster verses from Gunna and Young Thug vaguely harken back to Baker's rap lineage, beating the listener over the head with the same melodramatic sentiments of his older work, now under the guise of punk.</p><p>Baker's lyrics run the gamut from trite declarations of suffering to half-hearted jabs at the American government and Big Tech. On \"god save me,\" another cut-and-paste pop-punk track, he lazily drifts into this activism with the lines, \"Say hi 'cause the government tapped the phone / Fuck cops, read me my Miranda rights / Poison the brain, follow along.\" Baker's questioning of authority isn't fortified with any solid social critique, attempting to capture the same rebellious spirit of pop-punk predecessors without their ingenuity.</p><p>The track \"WW4\" wrestles with \"the establishment\" with comparable clumsiness, as Baker declares, \"The zombie apocalypse is not too far away / I think iRobot is real, but I'm kind of afraid to say / Any thoughts in my mind / They wanna monitor us / Let's go and find the mainframe / And blow the monitor up.\" With close to 10 million Instagram followers, one has to wonder whether Baker would enthusiastically blow up this theoretical mainframe if actually presented with the opportunity.</p><p>It's probably fair to assume that most fans are not listening to Baker's music for his cutting wit or hard-hitting political commentary. Yet these haphazard attempts at talking about \"real shit\" seem to signal the musician's aspirations for more substantive content. Nonetheless, when Baker presents cerebral quips like, \"Everybody's so nice lately (Everybody's not nice),\" on the track \"papercuts,\" this lofty goal seems only more out of reach.</p><p>On \"sid and nancy,\" a track referencing the 1986 film that chronicles Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols and girlfriend Nancy Spungen's tumultuous relationship, Baker places himself in the shoes of the legendary rockstar. He sings, \"Count to ten and see if I die / Write it in blood and we both sign / Sid and Nancy, another suicide,\" alluding to the mysterious circumstances surrounding Spungen's murder and Vicious's own subsequent death. Just like his unsuccessful incorporations of nonconformist punk themes earlier in the project, here Baker is attempting to insert himself into a punk heritage to which he doesn't belong.</p><p>Mainstream sellout brings nothing new to the table of pop-punk given its almost untouched instrumental inspiration from the genre's early 2000s heyday. Baker seems to believe that because he has production credits from Travis Barker and boldly begins songs like \"maybe\" with a count of 2, 3, 5 because he's \"sick of 1, 2, 3,\" that he has mastered the revolutionary ethos of pop-punk. Yet his half-baked references to societal problems and woe-is-me outlook are not enough to actually enmesh him in its history. As the last track of mainstream sellout plays out, the listener is only left thinking that the album has been very aptly named.</p><p>Daily Arts Writer Nora Lewis can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:noralew@umich.edu\">noralew@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5284489</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:655T-D5V1-DY7P-T47H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 7, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ann Arbor</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6N</classCode><className>POP &amp; ROCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009U6M</classCode><className>RAP MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp; ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS138</classCode><className>MICHIGAN, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Below are Senator Schumer's remarks, which can also be viewed here :</p><p>Right now, there is a fire burning in Oregon the size of New York City. A heat wave recently rolled through the Pacific Northwest that melted power lines and cracked roadways in two. Hurricanes and flooding in the East have battered one community after another. Earlier this year, a snowstorm engulfed the typically-scorching state of Texas and claimed the lives of hundreds, hundreds, of people. And of course we saw what happened in Europe with the flooding.</p><p>These extreme, once-in-a-century weather events are now commonplace. The dangers of climate change are here and they are real. The dangers of climate change.</p><p>Fighting climate change will take not only new technologies and new ways of thinking, but something more basic: it will take people. Lots of people, working together to fight climate change from the ground up.</p><p>This morning, I joined with my Democratic colleagues from the House and Senate to push a bold new approach to fighting climate change that will help create thousands of good paying jobs in the process: the Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p>The idea at the core of the Civilian Climate Corps harkens back to the New Deal, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were put to work on conservation and infrastructure projects across the country. During the Great Depression, President Roosevelt needed ways to put Americans to work--and to do it fast--and he found a way to do it while having those workers do something enormously productive for the country, building public works, and dams, and bridges, and airfields, and flood and forest-fire prevention.</p><p>The Civilian Conservation Corps--as it was called at the time--was a brilliant idea, a success that should be harnessed once again, this time to fight climate change. The bottom line is that we need a CCC for the 21st Century.</p><p>We can put Americans to work on climate and resiliency projects; we can put Americans to work on clean energy initiatives across the country; we can put Americans to work helping poorer and more disconnected communities face the challenge of climate change.

(AP) \u2014 Nearly eight decades have passed since William Linder, known to loved ones as \u201cBud,\u201d was killed in one of the longest and most costly battles of World War II.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For years, his remains were buried in a cemetery in Belgium \u2014 an unknown soldier.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But on Oct. 29, the Army staff sergeant from Piedmont, born 107 years prior, reached his final resting place back home in Anderson County with all the pomp and circumstance of a fallen war hero returning home.</p><p>Shots rang out in salute by an Army honor guard, which carried his casket draped with an American flag.</p><p>One of Linder\u2019s grand-nieces, Melanie Hitt, spoke to family and military veterans gathered at Dolly Cooper Veterans Cemetery for the belated funeral and thanked the modern miracle of DNA tracing, which was used to determine his identity last month.</p><p>Hitt shared the importance of the family handing down stories of \u201cUncle Bud,\u201d a man younger generations never knew.</p><p>\u201cThey would keep the stories alive from the old family,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would talk about the things they used to do, so all of us kids knew that there was an Uncle Bud. We always heard that grandma said he\u2019ll come home one day \u2014 and he is.\u201d</p><p>The day of Linder\u2019s funeral was gloomy and gray, fog hovering just above with a chilly wind blowing. It was an echo of the unforgiving cold, snow and desolation he faced in the densely wooded Hurtgen Forest of Germany as the Allies reached a stalemate on the Western Front in November 1944, months after storming the beaches of Normandy.</p><p>Linder was assigned to Company E, 12th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division.</p><p>Wilton Fowler, a state chaplain of the Army who served in West Berlin during the Cold War, described the conditions Linder faced in the Battle of Hurtgen, a five-month series of battles fought by the Army that ended in an Allied breakthrough but at heavy cost and, in retrospect, viewed by historians as an ill-advised offensive.</p><p>The Germans, Fowler told the audience, knew the landscape well and prepared the field for battle years before. The Army\u2019s first objective was to secure Rur River dam so the enemy couldn\u2019t release floodwaters. But the advance stalled.</p><p>\u201cThe results were horrific. The battle took on the form of a trench war, like we knew from World War I,\u201d Fowler said.</p><p>It was the longest battle in U.S. history, and, Fowler said, was a \u201cpainful chapter\u201d overshadowed by more-successful campaigns. However, \u201cwithin this forest, there was a man from Piedmont, South Carolina, who offered his life so that other lives might be saved.\u201d</p><p>Linder was reported missing in action on Nov. 16, 1944. The Germans had not listed him as a prisoner of war. After a year passed, the War Department officially presumed him dead.</p><p>After decades of mystery, the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) announced on Oct. 18 that scientists had confirmed Linder\u2019s identity three weeks earlier through DNA testing, and dental and anthropological analysis.</p><p>Following the war, according to the release, the American Graves Registration Command investigated the whereabouts of the remains of soldiers in Europe. After several investigations in the Hurtgen Forest area between 1946 and 1950, Linder\u2019s remains could not be found. In December 1951, he was declared \u201cnon-recoverable.\u201d</p><p>But while studying American losses in the forest, a DPAA historian believed that a set of remains discovered by local residents in 1947 in the aftermath of a forest fire could be Linder. The remains, and the time buried as unknown in the Ardennes American Cemetery in Belgium, were disinterred in April 2019 for testing at an Air Force base in Nebraska.</p><p>Linder\u2019s name is recorded on the Tablets of the Missing at Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in Henri-Chapelle, Belgium, along with others still missing from World War II. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-542d96e836937e38f957ecc82c33787a20211106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6416-3H11-JC5B-G4SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><timeReceived>4:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

In comments to reporters Tuesday, Lukashenko recalled Russia's Vladimir Putin lamenting that Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin 'won't pick up the phone' while thousands of his mercenaries unleashed an uprising on Russian territory, Belta reported. According to Lukashenko, Putin was prepared to have Prigozhin killed until Lukashenko 'urged Putin not to rush.' He said he then got hold of the mercenary boss via officials in Rostov, where Prigozhin had already claimed to have taken over government sites. 'For the first 30 minutes we spoke exclusively in curse words,' Lukashenko said. After a lengthy conversation, he claimed, Prigozhin finally gave in after Lukashenko warned him he'd be 'squished like a bug' with help from Belarusian troops. 'By no means should you make a hero out of me nor out of Putin or Prigozhin,' he said, although that was probably the furthest thing from everyone's minds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rt.com/news/579045-cia-director-wagner-mutiny/\">CIA Chief Spoke to Moscow About Wagner Revolt \u2014 WSJ</url></p><p>CIA Director William Burns reached out to Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) head Sergey Naryshkin to state that the US 'wasn't involved' in Wagner Group leader Evgeny Prigozhin's march on Moscow last weekend, the Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>Burns spoke to Naryshkin by phone shortly after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko brokered a deal whereby Prigozhin would leave for Belarus in exchange for immunity from prosecution, the newspaper reported on Friday.</p><p>An anonymous US official summed up the message relayed by the CIA chief as 'the US wasn't involved.

On his way to his office, Andy Hudak stopped for a hot cup of drip coffee at One World Caf\u00e9 on Main Street. Last week he was in Florida studying controlled forest fires. In two weeks, he will travel to Georgia to study their methods of controlled burning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Climate change is such an overreaching issue for everything we do. It's hard to think of something we do that doesn't have at least some implication for climate change,\" Hudak said.</p><p>Hudak's current research uses aerial Light Detection and Ranging, also known as LiDAR, to study how wildfires interact with the forest. LiDAR is a radar system consisting of a laser and an echo recorder. Airplanes or drones carry the LiDAR systems flying over a sturdy area, measuring and recording the echoes of each laser shot. It then filters and inserts the data onto a Digital Terrain Model. These models are converted into maps that reveal pre-fire, active fire and post-fire ecological conditions.</p><p>Hudak grew up in rural Minnesota near Grand Rapids. He has loved to explore his surroundings from a young age and discovered his interest in the world's ecological wonderlands. He was interested in ecology before he even knew what the word meant.</p><p>Steeped in a culture where his dad was an avid hunter and fisherman, Hudak was eventually led to a career as a research forester.</p><p>\"Ideas and things I could observe just being out in the woods is all part of ecology, so I got interested in that,\" Hudak said.</p><p>His formal education started at Itasca Community College in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Hudak later transferred to the University of Minnesota at St. Paul. He graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in ecology, evolution and behavior.</p><p>In his last year at the University of Minnesota, his application to graduate school at the University of Colorado and his application to join the Peace Corps came through at the same time. Now, he needed to decide between continuing school or traveling the world.</p><p>Hudak decided to join the Peace Corps and taught secondary science in Malawi, Africa. They needed someone with a science degree.</p><p>\"I was curious about teaching and teaching is one thing you can do with a science degree,\" Hudak said.</p><p>While in Africa, he became interested in the issues around local deforestation, something the area has been struggling to fight. Hudak questioned what he could do to study this problem and find a way to contribute to a solution.</p><p>Currently, Hudak works with doctorate students from the University of Idaho. His primary research interest is in fire ecology. Still, sometimes he gets called on to share his expertise with researchers in other fields. Hudak used his expertise in remote sensing to coach Jessica Stitt, a doctorate candidate in wildlife biology.</p><p>Andy Hudak and Ryan McCarley inventorying residual fuels in 2019, a year after the 2018 Rattlesnake Creek Fire, near Riggins, Idaho | Courtesy Benjamin Bright.</p><p>Together with UI Professor Lee Vierling, UI Professor Kerri Vierling and Carlos Silva from the University of Florida, Hudak worked with Stitt to develop a research paper called \"Evaluating the Use of Lidar to Discern Snag Characteristics Important for Wildlife\" published February 2022.\u00a0</p><p>A dead tree still standing in the forest is known as a snag which are essential for wildlife. Raptors use large snags as nesting platforms and woodpeckers use the smaller snags as nesting sites. A tree becomes a snag when it dies naturally of old age or gets killed in a forest fire.</p><p>\"People should understand that fire is not evil and shouldn't be vilified,\" Stitt said.</p><p>Stitt's research paper used Airborne Laser Scanning to map and identify where and how big the snags were. Her study plots were in forest stands within the Idaho Panhandle National Forest.</p><p>Hudak spends a lot of time considering the impact of his research, working with students and co-authors as a team to write research papers. He is always ready for new challenges.</p><p>\"I still have trouble saying no to learning new things,\" Hudak said.</p><p>In his current position, he has the freedom to choose the topics he studies. Hudak works on whatever piques his interest and gets to choose his collaborators, which is why he loves his work so much.</p><p>\"One of the draws for a lot of the people that do this kind of work is to be able to be in the field and in the woods. When you're out in the field, you remember, 'Okay this is why I'm doing it,'\" Stitt said. \"Once you are sitting behind a computer, it gets harder and harder to remember 'Why am I analyzing this data?'\" \u00a0</p><p>Fieldwork gives the freedom of being untethered to email and cell service. It's challenging work, but the rewards come from being in the forest.</p><p>The attention his research has attracted has pushed Hudak out of the field and into the office, and he's swapped the hard hat and work boots for comfortable office attire.</p><p>\"I have less time to do my own analysis now. I do a lot more project management, so I'm in a lot more meetings, I'm often running the meetings,\" Hudak said.</p><p>As the morning rain passed and the sun poked through the clouds. Hudak swigged the last of his coffee, donned his bicycle helmet, pant leg clips and rain jacket. He then pedaled off towards another project management day at the office.</p><p>Will Simpson can be reached at [email protected]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5283633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:655G-RN31-DY7P-T211-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Idaho Argonaut: University of Idaho</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 6, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Moscow</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>ID</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp;

His younger brother raised an alarm after he noticed the crocodile attackingSoumyaranjan. </p><p><br/>Within minutessome locals rushed to the spot and carried out a search operation.However, as of Thursday morning, they were unable to find the victim, Kalinga TV reported.[1]The boy's exact age was not revealed. <br/>'Soumyaranjan Mallick of Udayanathpur panchayat had gone to the river for fishing. He has been dragged into the river by a crocodile. ODRAF (Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force)team are yet to locate the body of the victim but have seen the crocodile basking on the bank of the river. I will speak to the Collector and the SRC (Special Relief Commissioner) and extend whatever help is possible from the government,' Sunanda Das, a local politicianwho visited the scene of the attack, said, according to Ommcom News.[2] <br/><br/>Das alsovisited the victim's family and conveyed her sympathies for the horrific tragedy. <br/>In a recent report, Odisha TV[3] said the increase in thepopulation of large semi-aquatic reptiles has led to a rise in the instances of conflict between crocodiles and human beings residing in the riverside areas.As per official data, a total of 26 people have been killed in the human-crocodile interaction over the past 12 years.Three people have died in the attack in the last three months only. <br/>In another recent incident in the southern state of Karnataka, a crocodile[4] was found swimming in a river with the partially-eaten body of a boy. The reptile had attacked the child just two days before the body of the victim was found.The forest, fire and police departments begansearching for the 15-year-old boy after he was attacked and dragged away by the crocodile into the Kali River. Later, the policefound the crocodile, but were unable to catch it. Whenrescue teams approached the crocodile itescaped after dropping the body in the water. <br/> This is a representational image.

This year, it stopped altogether: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/uk/uk-england-climate-drought-cmd-intl/index.html\">Messelis' fields now crackle in the sunlight</url>; her stone cistern echoes with thirst.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On this small farm in the upper reaches of Seillans, a commune in the Var region of southern France, the fields are bare but for the parched remnants of the last harvest. Normally, aubergines, tomatoes, peppers and melons thrive here. Now, the fields lie fallow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Messelis' reservoirs first ran empty after last winter was remarkably dry. She then had to rely on tap water to grow the organic fruit and vegetables that make up the baskets she sells to neighbors and at local markets.</p><p>Then in May, local authorities tightened the taps as well.</p><p>France is suffering what authorities say is likely its worst drought on record. It's a similar picture across much of Europe - more than 60% of land in the European Union is under drought warnings or more severe alerts, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/europe/eu-uk-drought-warnings-weather-climate-intl/index.html\">European Drought Observatory. </url></p><p>The rain has been so scant that major rivers are drying up in parts. The Loire and Rhone in France, the Po in Italy and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/economy/rhine-water-levels-german-economy-intl-hnk/index.html\">Rhine in Germany</url> have all experienced particularly low water levels, some of them have even shrunk, impacting transport, agriculture and energy production.</p><p>Now downpours are hitting several parts of the country. In the Loire region of central France, they've triggered flooding. The soil is so parched, like a dry sponge, it simply can't absorb that much rain. In Paris, floods that hit Tuesday evening forced 10 underground Metro stations to close. The stormy weather has brought relief from the heat, but little to break the drought. What's needed is less intense and more consistent rain over much longer periods of time.</p><p>In January, when worries about the dry winter emerged, Seillans' authorities proposed to sell Messelis emergency water supplies that had been trucked in at (EURO)20 ($20.40) per cubic meter (around 264 gallons), she said. Private suppliers were offering only slightly cheaper rates. Normally, she would pay just around 50 cents ($0.51) for the same amount from the tap.</p><p>It was an impossible option for her.</p><p>\"It's not worth starting,\" the 54-year-old farmer told CNN. \"It's almost like we're working just to pay for the water.\"</p><p>Unlike generations past, Messelis' neighbors today are more likely to have a swimming pool than a vegetable plot, a somewhat cruel irony for her this summer: In the first period of water restrictions, residents were still allowed to top up their pools, while her crops withered.</p><p>\"It was a moment of shock,\" she said. \"It's so obvious that the priority [should be] to eat.\"</p><p>Dark clouds</p><p>In May, the people of Seillans were put under water rationing, given a 150 liters a day per person in the worst-hit part of the commune. It wasn't long until the rest of Seillans were given daily limits too, although of a higher 200 liters.</p><p>It should be enough to cover basic needs - the average French person consumes 149 liters daily. But going unchecked, it's easy to use hundreds of liters more. Just running a tap while brushing teeth or between rinsing dishes wastes six liters of water every minute.</p><p>Seillans was one of the first communities in France to run out of sufficient water for residents this year, but by early August, some 100 communes were in the same position, according to French Ecological Transition Minister Christophe Bechu.</p><p>Many parts of the Var region have seen around 80% less rain than the long-term average between the start of July and August 10, according to the drought mission for the regional land and sea directorate. Some areas haven't seen any measurable rain at all.</p><p>The region is now \"in a crisis,\" the mission's chief, Julien Assante, told CNN.</p><p>Droughts in the Mediterranean region, where Seillans sits, have increased in frequency already because of the human-driven climate crisis, and the heat waves that can exacerbate them are also more common and more intense, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/factsheets/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Regional_Fact_Sheet_Europe.pdf\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</url>. The more the Earth warms, the more the region will experience aridity, droughts and fire weather conditions.</p><p>And drought isn't just impacting farmers and households. With it has come intense wildfires. More than 780,000 hectares (more than 3,000 square miles) across Europe have burned so far this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">according to the European Forest Fire Information System</url>. So exhausted are France's firefighting resources that colleagues from Romania, Italy, Poland and Austria, as well as aircraft from Greece and Sweden, have been called in to battle the blazes.</p><p>New rituals</p><p>In the Ricou household, the drought has sparked a new ritual. Every few days, Brigitte Ricou climbs to the back of her shrubbery to photograph her water meter. It's the best way to monitor how much she, her husband and her visiting grandson are using.</p><p>\"We look at our meter a lot,\" she told CNN from her kitchen in lower Seillans, where there is a 200-liter daily limit per resident. She said it was difficult to estimate how much water each person uses every day, and that it was something that required practice and thought.</p><p>She and her husband have implemented a range of measures to limit their water use, from washing food in bowls and using that same water for their plants. They use bottled water for drinking, take shorter showers and they don't flush the toilet after every use.</p><p>\"Sometimes I lower my consumption drastically to make my 200 liters,\" she said, adding that she doesn't view the quota as a right, as some people do, but as a maximum allowance. \"This water, it's precious.\"</p><p>To Seillans Mayor Rene Ugo, water is more like a \"sacred\" resource. A small stream that used to run through the town all year round was once the lifeblood of a variety of businesses lower Seillans, from a perfume shop to an oil press, he said. But as it dried up, so too did business. This year, it hasn't flowed at all.</p><p>\"It was a warning,\" Ugo said, referring to his observations of dry conditions back in January. \"I was afraid of what could happen and those fears came to pass.\"</p><p>And in Seillans, the stopgap measures go well beyond rationing - the town is now trucking freshwater in. The local town hall oversaw the purchase of a water tanker, which now makes eight trundling return trips to restock the worst-hit districts' water reservoirs.

The destruction affects mainly trees of small and medium size. Loss of biomass (stored carbon) in the three years following a fire reaches 12.8%. Mortality is worst in the first two years, and makes way for the growth of native herbaceous bamboo species.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Amazon region corresponds to 59% of Brazil, with an area of 5 million sq. km., 775 municipalities, 67% of the planet's tropical forest, a third of its trees, and 20% of its freshwater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is also the Brazilian biome with the most fires every year since records began, according to the National Space Research Institute (INPE). In 2020, INPE recorded 103,161 fires, the largest number since 2017 (107,439) and the third-largest in the decade. The second-largest number occurred in 2015 (106,438).</p><p>The 2015 fires, exacerbated by the extreme drought relating to El Ni\u00f1o, were the focus for a study supported by S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation \u2013 FAPESP via two projects (16/21043-8 and 20/06734-0). An article describing the results, including data collected directly in the field, is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.</p><p>The study was led by Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz de Arag\u00e3o, who heads INPE's Earth Observation and Geoinformatics Division (DIOTG).</p><p>\"Studying how forests respond to fire in the long run is one of the frontiers of knowledge about the functioning of the Amazon. It's important both to enhance our capacity to model the biome's future and climate interactions, and to provide data for Brazil to report emissions and carbon removal more accurately in the context of policies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation [REDD+], which can yield financial benefits for the country,\" Arag\u00e3o told.</p><p>The researchers analyzed burned and unburned areas immediately after the fires that swept through the north of the area between the Purus and Madeira Rivers (central Amazon), and conducted annual surveys to track the demographic drivers of biomass change in the ensuing three years.</p><p>The area is located in the municipality of Autazes, some 90 km southeast of Manaus, near the BR-319 highway. The researchers measured trees with a diameter of 10 cm or more, and estimated the extent to which stem growth and tree mortality were influenced by fire intensity (represented by bole char height, an indicator of the length of time a tree bole has been exposed to the flames and high temperatures of a fire), and tree morphology (size and wood density).</p><p>Most of the field work was done by Aline Pontes-Lopes, a PhD candidate at INPE, and Camila Silva, a researcher at the Amazon Institute of Environmental Research (IPAM), respectively first and second authors of the article.</p><p>\"The field data is very valuable. The study included multiple censuses of the same burned area, a type of information that's rare for the Amazon. In particular, field data is rare for tree mortality, growth and local dynamics in rainforest areas generally. The study also analyzed the effects of fire on the wettest parts of the forest, where it's unusual. A great deal of new knowledge about such areas was produced,\" said Ricardo Dal'Agnol, a researcher at INPE and another co-author of the article.</p><p>Dal'Agnol, who is supported by FAPESP via a postdoctoral scholarship, participated in another study published in January showing that water stress, soil fertility and anthropic forest degradation create gaps in the Amazon Rainforest, and influence tree mortality more than any other factors.</p><p>Results</p><p>\"In the burned areas we saw that saplings, small trees and bushes are the first to die, clearing the understory enough for us to walk through the forest and set up the forest inventory plots in 2015. Small and medium trees above all died in two to three years,\" Pontes-Lopes said in an interview given to Ag\u00eancia FAPESP. The understory is the layer of trees and shrubs beneath the forest canopy but above the forest floor.</p><p>Another important point, she added, is the impact of fire on biomass. According to the study, biomass remained stable throughout the three-year period in the unburned plots but decreased 12.8% in the burned areas.</p><p>The impact was especially severe on lianas, which lost 38.6% of their individuals and 38.1% of their biomass. Tree loss was 28% for individual trees and 12.1% for biomass; for palms, the loss was 14.6% for individuals and 27.2% for biomass. The same comparisons for unburned plots showed much smaller losses or no significant change.</p><p>The scientists' growth measurements and comparisons of burned with unburned areas showed that trees with lower wood density grew faster in burned areas in a three-year timeframe, and that large trees stored more carbon in burned areas. However, faster growth by these two tree classes did not cause an increase in the forest's total biomass or in wood production, both of which were outpaced by tree mortality due to fire.</p><p>According to Pontes-Lopes, other groups are using the data collected in at least four studies. The data has been standardized and posted to ForestPlots.net, a website for researchers, forest scientists and forest communities to share data that will help measure, monitor and understand the world's forests, especially in the tropics.</p><p>Future</p><p>According to the researchers, continuous monitoring of areas affected by fire at regular intervals (annual or semiannual) is important to improve our understanding of carbon emissions and uptake, the time forest takes to recover to a pre-fire state, and disruption of carbon dynamics by tree mortality due to additional drought and fire events. Future studies should focus on long-term post-fire monitoring to find out whether delayed mortality of large trees occurs on a significant scale in the Amazon, they conclude.</p><p>Fire in the Amazon is estimated to cause more than 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions due to land use change. These gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), contribute to the average temperature rise, which could reach 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2050 if effective measures are not taken soon to mitigate global warming.</p><p>The long-term impact of fires in the Amazon is insufficiently quantified, however. An article published last year with Silva as first author showed that more than 70% of the gross emissions resulting from forest fires in a 30-year period were due to tree mortality and decomposition (as distinct from combustion). These emissions were only partially offset by forest growth in the same period. The study also found that net annual emissions peaked four years after forest fires.</p><p>Deforestation and forest degradation, in conjunction with climate change, compromise forest carbon stocks. Plant photosynthesis converts light and CO2 into energy, reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. The carbon remains in the biomass until the vegetation burns, or dies and decomposes.</p><p>\"Without proper land use regulation, the current intention of Brazil's government to pave the BR-319 will increase deforestation in the Purus-Madeira region, increasing ignition sources and the associated risk of large-scale forest dieback,\" the authors warn.</p><p>They recommend two initiatives in support of future decision making to avoid large-scale forest fire in the Amazon: mapping of forest fire risks, and mapping of potential fire impacts based on morphological plant traits. Remote sensing technologies are essential to complement field inventories in developing these initiatives.</p><p>\"If the effects of fire on the forest are better understood, management of the biome can improve thanks to better fire management policy, which should be decoupled from deforestation reduction policy,\" Arag\u00e3o said. \"Progress in this matter is crucial to quantify the real impact of human activity on the carbon cycle in the Amazon and find coherent ways of achieving sustainable development for the nation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-234766313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CY-WBP1-JDJN-655V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 16, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

Gander's reading marked the first in-person event Southern Miss's Center for Writers has held since October 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adam Clay, the Director of the Center for Writers, talked about how surreal the event felt during its introduction.</p><p>\"[2019] feels like another life ago.\" Clay said. \"And how lucky we are to break that long hiatus from in-person events with a poet like Forrest Gander.\"</p><p>Forrest Gander, the main speaker of the event, has worked for years as a poet, editor and translator. His work has been in a number of magazines, including The Nation, The Boston Review and The New York Times Book Review. In addition to his literary awards, Gander has also received a number of fellowships, including from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim and the Whiting Foundation.</p><p>\"His most recent collection, 'Twice Alive', considers humanity as an active collaborator with the natural world and the people we share it with,\" Clay said. \"In 2021, a time of fear, uncertainty and sheer exhaustion, 'Twice Alive' articulates a view of the world as an ecology of intimacies that asks us to be absorbed in the next moment beyond our given life.\"</p><p>Gander primarily read from 'Twice Alive' once he took the stage. Most of the poems he presented, such as \"Wasteland (for Santa Rosa)\", \"Post-Fire Forest\" and \"Sea: Night Surfing in Bolinas\", were heavily inspired by his initial studies of geology. The poems of 'Twice Alive' try to rationalize Gander's complicated relationships with intimacy and grief by exploring natural phenomena.</p><p>\"Post-Fire Forest\", for example, describes the real life work of post-fire biologists. In the immediate aftermath of a forest fire, these biologists scour the burnt remains of the forest to try to find evidence that life is returning to the area quickly. This is so they can protect the area from lumber businesses, whose expansions would end up damaging the area far more than the fire.</p><p>Gander, in an initial explanation of the poem, said he had the opportunity to work with one such biologist in California. They spent several days attempting to look for a Black-Backed Woodpecker, one of the first animal species that returns to a post-fire forest. Gander found that the journey felt similar to navigating the world after a tragedy - specifically, navigating the world after the death of his wife, poet C.D. Wright.</p><p>\"It's like two kinds of grief,\" Gander said. \"[As if] I've also met someone who's full of life [like the woodpecker] and I almost don't know what to do with that.\"</p><p>Gander himself seemed like a very reserved man, speaking with a gentle affect throughout most of the presentation. He wasn't afraid to make a few jokes here and there, and there were times you could hear him try to work through his thoughts as he spoke them. When it came time to present his work, though, his confidence and passion were on full display.</p><p>In a Q&amp;A shortly after the reading, Gander said how glad he was to once again present his work in front of a live audience, especially with all of the hardships he has faced over the years.</p><p>\"I don't know how long I'll be alive, and what I think about [the most] is, you know, what will I have done with my life, what did I focus on?\" Gander said. \"And I'm really glad it's not money.\"</p><p>The next writer featured in the Visiting Writers series, Maria Kuznetsova, will be at Southern Miss on Jan. 27, 2022.

When I can come up with one, it makes the flight more interesting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>My wife Joan and I have been spending the summer in Maine to escape the summer heat and humidity at our home in Tavares, Florida. It seemed that Maine is much better at controlling the COVID\u00e2\u20ac\"19 pandemic outbreak than the Sunshine State. An added bonus!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>Earlier this summer we made a day trip to Moosehead Lake in Greenville, to checkout Currier's Flying Service. The owner, Roger Currier, had been posting great photos of old flying boats of the 1920s and 1930s to my Facebook page which I enjoyed although we never actually met.</p><p><br/>I figured this would be a good reason to make the trip to Moosehead and meet the man. Of course, while at it we could take one of their aerial seaplane tours of the area.</p><p><br/>Unfortunately, all their scenic air tours were booked on that day and since it was a two-hour drive from our summer cabin on Pushaw lake in Glenburn, I didn't know when we might be back.</p><p><br/>During the summer I was also doing some genealogy work about my family on Ancestry.com and talking with my sister to see what she remembered about our folks.</p><p><br/>I discovered that in 1934 my father and mother had spent their honeymoon at a fishing lodge called West Outlet Camps on Moosehead Lake. I was born in 1935. Was it possible I was conceived in the back woods of northern, Maine? Maybe! Anyway, a reason to take a plane ride to visit that spot on the lake.</p><p><br/>Then I remembered that one summer vacation in high school back in the early 1950s, I had a summer job with the Maine Forest Service. I was on a fire crew for five days fighting a forest fire on Spencer Mountain that borders Moosehead Lake. We would hike the mountain each day and construct fire breaks with shovels and grub hoes all day, then hike back down late in the afternoon. I learned what hard work was and how true exhaustion felt.</p><p><br/>Seeing Spencer Mountain again will give me another reason for a flight over the area.</p><p><br/>We watched the weather reports to pick a good flying day and finally made it back up to Greenville on Sept. 4 to make this nostalgic flight. It was a perfect day with just a few puffy clouds and a slight breeze from the northwest following the passage of a cold front the night before.</p><p><br/>We boarded the flying service's Cessna 180 and headed out. Roger Paradise, their chief pilot, opened the throttle, got the little seaplane skimming across the lake and raised the right wing a bit to get that float out of the water thereby reducing the water's friction. We were soon airborne.</p><p><br/>The views from the plane were spectacular. This lake is forty miles long and quite wide, with many islands and mountains right down to the shore line. Moosehead's shore is well populated with cottages and docks. In the distance we could see several large mountains clearly including the famous Mount Katahdin, the end of the Appalachian Trail.</p><p><br/>Closer to us were Big Spencer and Little Spencer mountains. I looked for evidence of the forest fire I mentioned, but it appeared everything had grown back quite well. Mother Nature had done her job during those intervening years.</p><p><br/>As we continued to fly to the north, we eventually flew over Lobster Lake which is not as well populated as Moosehead. Our pilot mentioned that you have to fly-in or hike-in to get here. This is where some of their bush piloting revenue would come from. Here you would find the wilderness fishing or hunting camps.</p><p><br/>At the northern turnaround point of the trip, Roger mentioned that we were about 35 miles south of the Canadian border and pointed out a distant mountain at that location.</p><p><br/>After making a turn to the southwest and flying over the west outlet of Moosehead lake, he showed us where the West Outlet Camps used to be located. Back in the 1920s and 1930s the way most people got there was to take a train from Bangor to Greenville Junction, then go the rest of the way by boat. There were no roads around Moosehead lake at that time.</p><p><br/>As we continued to fly back to base, we passed the 800-foot Mount Kineo with its rock face right down into the water.</p><p><br/>Flying downwind of some of the mountains in the area, caused us to bounce around a little as the wind would create a little turbulence. But it wasn't too dramatic.</p><p><br/>We had a great flight with a very informative pilot guide. I got to see where I spent five grueling days of my youth and where my father and mother had spent their honeymoon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRDLY-26920560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-HF01-DY6V-N005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bangor Daily News</copyright><publicationName>Bangor Daily News (Maine)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000C4CX</classCode><className>ANCESTRY.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FPS</classCode><className>SEASONAL WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009U6G</classCode><className>GENEALOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7R6</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT PILOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1HI</classCode><className>BANGOR, ME, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS135</classCode><className>MAINE, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Greg Gianforte's office announced Wednesday. <br/>The 'innovation' grants range between $142,000 and $1 million. Applications were asked to demonstrate how they would use the funds to improve child care affordability, increase access, and provide high quality and sustainable services. <br/>The governor's office cited Browning Public Schools as a group that plans to use its $207,000 grant for hiring and retaining more child care providers. It also said Family Promise of Gallatin Valley Inc. will use its nearly $990,000 grant to expand its child care center for infants, toddlers and preschoolers.  <br/>'For too long, Montana's working families faced a shortage of child care providers, putting them between a rock and a hard place,' Gianforte said in a Wednesday press release. 'To increase access to sustainable, quality child care and address this longstanding problem, we're investing in quality providers who operate in child care deserts throughout our state.' <br/>Tori Sproles, executive director of the advocacy group Child Care Connections, said the funds will go a long way to help their partners in Gallatin, Park, Lewis and Clark, and Jefferson counties provide better child care. She said the grants could be used to expand staffing outside of traditional work hours, or help an employer purchase a certain number of spots at child care centers for their workforce. <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 08.15.202208.15.2022  <br/> 08.15.202208.16.2022  <br/> 08.12.202208.12.2022  <br/><br/><br/>'The innovation grant was really meant to bring the community into the problem. How do we address child care issues collaboratively and innovatively,' Sproles said. 'It's going to make an impact.' <br/>The press release did not say when the department plans to distribute the funds to recipients. A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health and Human Services said the agency expects to finalize contracts with the grantees within 30 days. The grants cycle is scheduled to last until September 2024. <br/>Child care providers have been under acute strain since the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because of increasing health and safety expenses, a persistent struggle to hire and retain qualified staff, and the strict staff-to-child ratios required to maintain licenses. Child care centers in rural areas can be few and far between[1]. In more urban areas, providers like Family Promise of Gallatin Valley report long waitlists, with demand outpacing available slots. <br/>The price tag for child care is also a high concern for many families across Montana, often putting the service out of reach for low-income and working families. A February report from the national advocacy group Child Care Aware found that the average cost of child care[2] in Montana in 2020 \u2014 the first year of the pandemic, before inflation became a national concern \u2014 was more than $9,300 annually. <br/>The full list of child care innovation grantees and their respective award amounts has been posted[3] on the state health department's website. The counties that include grant recipients are Glacier, Gallatin, Missoula, Mineral, Ravalli, Lewis and Clark, Beaverhead, Carter, Flathead, Granite, Yellowstone, Jefferson, Carbon, Deer Lodge, Sweet Grass, Fergus, Judith Basin, Petroleum, and Cascade. <br/>Gianforte's office said the recommendation to use the federal American Rescue Plan Act to create these child care providers came from the bipartisan ARPA Health Advisory Commission made up of lawmakers and executive staff members. <br/>That committee also recommended grants to help stabilize child care services[4] that recipients could use for staff pay, bonuses, recruitment, rent or mortgage, and other expenses related to COVID-19. The final application period for those grants closed last Friday. <br/>Gianforte's office said Wednesday that two-thirds of the $61 million total earmarked for those stabilization grants has been allocated. A summary of ARPA spending[5] from early August said roughly $30 million of child care stabilization grants and other supports had been paid out to recipients. <br/>House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, D-Helena, is one of the lawmakers assigned to the health advisory committee. She said Wednesday the governor's announcement was good news for the 19 counties with successful applicants, but that she's been frustrated by how long it has taken the Gianforte administration to distribute the federal emergency funds. <br/>'We approved this a year ago,' Abbott said, referring to the ARPA Health Advisory Commission. 'When you have money that is designed for relief and you have people across the state that are begging for relief, you want to see that money move efficiently and effectively.' <br/>Charlie Brereton, the new director of Montana's Department of Public Health and Human Services tapped to replace former director Adam Meier[6], said in the Wednesday press release that the innovation grants would help fill in gaps in child care deserts and increase the capacity of providers around Montana. <br/>'We look forward to these numerous projects moving forward to meet existing needs,' Brereton said. 'We appreciate the careful thought and planning that went into the applications that we believe will make a tremendous difference in Montana.'  <br/>Sproles acknowledged that a faster timeline for awarding grants would have been appreciated. In the end, she said she's glad to see the money on its way to communities in need. <br/>'It's hard to be negative about it,' Sproles said. 'There's still a need. That need has not gone anywhere.' <br/> latest stories How you can avoid causing Montana's next big wildfire[7] For more than 70 years, Smokey the Bear has had the same message for us: Only you can prevent forest fires.

Through innovative investment solutions, including patient and flexible financing, the Zero Gap Fund is helping its diverse and growing portfolio overcome traditional market barriers while delivering impact. The new report highlights the impact of the Fund's eight investments, including two new additions in 2021 that are showing strong momentum in closing the racial wealth gap in the United States.</p><p>Launched in partnership with the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and its flagship Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3), ZGF's mandate is focused on financial innovation namely, showing how new investment solutions can overcome traditional market barriers to channel critical financing to impact-driven investments at scale and unlock nascent market opportunities long ignored by private investors.</p><p>The past year has been a period of unprecedented challenge and dislocation around the globe, yet also a time of resilience and determination. Our collective response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its many ongoing shocks called for fortitude and creativity in the face of unexpected change. We saw that spirit across our partners in the Zero Gap Fund (ZGF or the Fund). By design, the Fund channels private investment toward solutions addressing the world's most pressing challenges: climate change, inequalities of opportunity, access to critical healthcare, among others.</p><p>Through the targeted deployment of patient, risk-tolerant, flexible capital, ZGF focuses on supporting new investment products and mechanisms marrying deep impact with the potential for replication and growth. ZGF portfolio companies were able to deliver on their impact mandates in 2020, despite the many adversities. The impact achieved in 2020 was a welcome reprieve for communities navigating the ongoing pandemic and shows promise for the future sustainability and scaling of ZGF portfolio companies.</p><p>Realized impact included:</p><p>LeapFrog expanded its reach to emerging consumers by nearly 23% with investments in companies offering essential services like healthcare and insurance to 221 million people.</p><p>The Forest Resilience Bond (FRB) completed 50% of its total restoration work despite Covid-19 restrictions and the largest forest fire season on record in the United States.</p><p>Sixup emphasized resilience and proactively enrolled its student borrowers into a Covid deferment program.</p><p>The CRAFT fund made its first investment into a solar hydro-panel company and as of December 2020, 5,552 panels were producing at least 1,222,675 liters of water across 48 different countries.</p><p>The Women's Livelihood Bond 2 directly impacted over 31,000 women, exceeding its target by over 20% and supported their borrowers to successfully navigate Covid-19 challenges.</p><p>The ZGF team looks to build off the resourcefulness and resilience of 2020 to identify and support new ways to improve the lives of vulnerable communities and ecosystems around the world. This impact report speaks to the driving motivation behind our work by highlighting the tangible ways the Fund's portfolio has enhanced lives and broadened opportunities, even in a year defined by uncertainty.</p><p>Maria Kozloski</p><p>Senior Vice President, Innovative Finance</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124575664</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6349-RP91-JCBF-S3W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>JOHN D &amp; CATHERINE T MACARTHUR FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813211MM</classCode><className>FOUNDATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPS0</classCode><className>ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES &amp; WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002245</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE ACCESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DSEZ</classCode><className>FINANCIAL INCLUSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002245</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE ACCESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) complained about the metal detectors in the Capitol, lying about why they were installed and going so far as to joke about blowing them up with explosives. </p><p><br/> The Florida congressman was in Lake County (just northwest of Orlando) to campaign for Florida State Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R-FL), who is running for Congress in 2022 and shares Gaetz's support for former President Donald Trump. <br/> Gaetz mentioned Rep. Lauren Boebert's (R-CO) objection to the metal detectors that were installed in the Capitol complex shortly after the Jan. 6 riot. Multiple Republican lawmakers loudly complained[1] about the metal detectors, claiming they were a violation of their constitutional rights, and Boebert was among those who attempted[2] to circumvent the screening by walking around the metal detectors or refusing to allow her bag to be searched. <br/> Boebert, said Gaetz during his remarks Saturday, was a '5 foot nothing woman' who 'carries a firearm for her personal protection,' but the metal detectors on the House floor were installed after 'they got triggered by that.' <br/> Again, to be clear, the metal detectors were installed in the immediate aftermath of the violent riots that took place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, after an angry mob of Trump supporters overwhelmed the Capitol Police and stormed into the building, not because an unnamed foe was 'triggered' by Boebert (even though she did begin her first term in Congress with a video[3] vowing to 'carry my Glock to Congress.' <br/> 'I said, man, is it, is it 'tannonite' [sic] or C4 we want to put in those metal detectors and we blow 'em up,' said Gaetz as Sabatini clapped and the crowd laughed and cheered. <br/> That's not some type of minor fireworks Gaetz is referencing. C-4 is a powerful type of plastic explosive, and hepresumably meant 'Tannerite[4],' a two-component explosive consisting of an oxidizer and an aluminium-powder based fuel. When combined, the two components are relatively stable but when struck with a high-velocity bullet impact, it results in an explosive reaction. Tannerite is marketed primarily for use in reactive targets, but YouTube videos of Tannerite-induced explosions have gone viral, sometimes because the explosion has unintentionally started a forest fire or hurt or killed someone. <br/> Watch the video above, via Right Side Broadcasting Network (the relevant section starts around the 24:00 mark). <br/> Have a tip we should know? <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tips@mediaite.com\">tips@mediaite.com</email> [5]; <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/house-republicans-rage-against-unconstitutional-metal-detectors-now-installed-outside-chamber-after-violent-riots/\">https://www.mediaite.com/news/house-republicans-rage-against-unconstitutional-metal-detectors-now-installed-outside-chamber-after-violent-riots/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediaite.com/politics/republicans-continue-boycott-of-capitol-metal-detectors-put-in-place-after-d-c-riot/\">https://www.mediaite.com/politics/republicans-continue-boycott-of-capitol-metal-detectors-put-in-place-after-d-c-riot/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/newly-elected-gop-congresswoman-faked-carrying-my-glock-to-congress-in-viral-campaign-video/\">https://www.mediaite.com/online/newly-elected-gop-congresswoman-faked-carrying-my-glock-to-congress-in-viral-campaign-video/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://tannerite.com\">https://tannerite.com</url>/ [ 5]: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tips@mediaite.com\">tips@mediaite.com</email></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

More details are provided at the end of this release.</p><p>PORTFOLIO UPDATE</p><p>Canadian Malartic Mine Life Extension and Update (5% NSR royalty on open pit and 3-5% NSR royalty on underground)</p><p>On June 30th, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (\u201cAgnico Eagle\u201d) provided results from an internal study on the Odyssey underground mine (the \u201c2023 Study\u201d) and exploration results from the Canadian Malartic Complex. The 2023 Study highlighted a 23% increase in life-of-mine payable gold production from the Odyssey mine compared to the internal study from 2020. The 2023 Study also outlined an extension of the mine life to 2042 with a mine plan that includes approximately 9.0 million ounces of gold, including 0.2 million ounces of gold in Mineral Reserves (2.8 million tonnes grading 2.22 grams per tonne \"g/t\" gold), 4.8 million ounces of gold in Indicated Resources (45.5 million tonnes grading 3.31 g/t gold) and Inferred Resources of 4.0 million ounces of gold (53.5 million tonnes grading 2.32 g/t gold).</p><p>Agnico Eagle noted that the potential for further conversion of Inferred Resources is significant and expected to further add to mine life. With additional exploration, Agnico Eagle believes that mineralization will continue to be added into the overall mine plan in the coming years, with good potential to grow annual gold production and further extend the mine life.</p><p>Figure 1: Canadian Malartic Production Profile</p><p/><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Press Release, June 20, 2023</p><p>In 2023, Agnico Eagle expects to spend approximately $21.8 million for 164,000 meters of drilling at Canadian Malartic and its adjoining properties. Approximately 95,030 meters were drilled during the first five months of 2023. Up to fifteen drills were active on Canadian Malartic and its surrounding properties during the same period, with five underground drills currently completing infill drilling on the Odyssey South deposit, four surface drills focused on completing infill drilling and transitioning to expand East Gouldie mineralization, and up to six drills active in regional exploration.</p><p>Drilling from underground in the Odyssey South deposit gradually increased during the first half of 2023 as ramp development provided access to new drill bays to test Odyssey South and Odyssey internal zones. As at May 31st, the ramp was 3,645 meters in length, reaching the bottom of the Odyssey South deposit at a depth of 578 meters. Shaft sinking activities started in March, with 55 meters completed as of June 20th. Underground infill drilling into Odyssey South continued to confirm the widths and grades of mineralization. With continued infill drilling success, Agnico Eagle\u2019s expectation is that Probable Mineral Reserves will continue to grow and replace 2023 production from that zone. Exploration drilling from the Odyssey ramp is also increasing confidence in the adjacent Odyssey internal zones and demonstrating good continuity of gold mineralization within these internal structures. The gold mineralization encountered to date in the Odyssey internal zones has not been included in the current mine plan and could represent an attractive near-term exploration opportunity considering the zone\u2019s proximity to existing and planned underground mine infrastructure around the Odyssey South and Odyssey North deposits. Agnico Eagle indicated that positive drill results at Odyssey internal zones show the potential to further increase production during the operation\u2019s 2023-2028 transition period.</p><p>Exploration at the Odyssey mine in 2023 is expected to include $11.8 million for 102,000 meters of drilling focused on the following four objectives:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Continued drilling into East Gouldie to convert additional Inferred Resources to Indicated Resources towards the outer portions of the deposit</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Testing the immediate extensions of East Gouldie to the west and at shallower depths</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Continued conversion drilling into extensions of Odyssey South; and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Further investigate Odyssey internal zones</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Select intercepts from recent drilling at Odyssey are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2: Canadian Malartic Long Section</p><p/><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Press Release, June 20, 2023</p><p>Agnico Eagle continues to expect to have 40,000 tonnes per day (\u201ctpd\u201d) of excess mill capacity starting in 2028 as processing of open pit ore and low-grade stockpiles gradually decreases and transitions to the higher-grade Odyssey underground mine. This additional mill capacity provides significant optionality for organic growth at Canadian Malartic and the greater land package. Agnico Eagle now controls 16.5 kilometers of continuous ground along the Cadillac-Larder Lake break at its Canadian Malartic and adjoining properties. Agnico Eagle has budgeted approximately $10 million in 2023 for 62,000 meters of regional exploration drilling on the Canadian Malartic, Rand Malartic, Camflo, Midway and East Amphi properties which offer potential opportunities to supplement the existing mine life with additional ore sources. Osisko holds 5% NSR royalties on East Amphi and Midway.</p><p>In addition to near-mill exploration, Agnico continues to explore the possibility of utilizing the excess mill and tailings storage capacity at Canadian Malartic to support other regional projects. Current internal studies include potential sources of ore from the Macassa near surface deposits and the AK deposit (2% NSR Royalty), the Upper Beaver project (2% NSR Royalty), other Kirkland Lake satellite deposits including Upper Canada and Anoki-McBean (2% NSR Royalties), as well as the Wasamac project. Osisko holds a $0.40 per tonne mill royalty on any ore processed at the Canadian Malartic mill that was not part of the initial Malartic property at the time of the sale to Yamana and Agnico Eagle in 2014.</p><p> Figure 3: Regional Pipeline \u2013 Cadillac-Larder Lake Break</p><p/><p>Source: Agnico Eagle Presentation \u201cCanadian Malartic Complex Mine Tour\u201d, June 21, 2023</p><p>CSA Initial Deliveries and Update (100% Silver Stream and 3.0% Copper Stream)</p><p>On June 16th, Osisko Bermuda Limited (\u201cOBL\u201d) closed the previously announced silver purchase agreement (the \u201cSilver Stream\u201d) and copper purchase agreement (the \u201cCopper Stream\u201d) referenced to production from the CSA mine (\u201cCSA\u201d) with Metals Acquisition Limited (\u201cMAC\u201d). Deliveries of refined silver to OBL under the Silver Stream will include approximately 1,527 GEOs in respect of silver produced at CSA between February 1st and June 15th. Deliveries of refined copper to OBL under the Copper Stream will commence in June 2024. Production in the first half of 2023 was impacted by planned downtime of the process plant to complete upgrades to the grinding circuit.</p><p>On June 27th, MAC announced that it had shipped its first shipment of concentrate to customers in Asia containing approximately 2,300 tonnes of copper and 28,000 ounces of silver. MAC has identified multiple opportunities to improve productivity, optimize costs, lower cut-off grade, increase the resource and extend the mine life at CSA.</p><p>Costa Fuego Royalty Acquisition (1.0% Copper NSR Royalty and 3.0% Gold NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 28th, Osisko announced a binding agreement to acquire a 1.0% copper NSR royalty and a 3.0% gold NSR royalty covering Hot Chili Limited\u2019s Costa Fuego Copper-Gold Project (\u201cCosta Fuego\u201d) in Chile.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Costa Fuego is one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper projects, not currently controlled by a major mining company. It hosts an NI 43-101 Indicated Resource including both the open pit and underground portions of the Cortadera and Productora deposits, of 725 million tonnes grading 0.47% Copper Equivalent (\u201cCuEq\u201d), grading 0.38% Copper, 0.11 g/t gold, 0.45 g/t silver and 93 ppm Molybdenum and an Inferred Resource of 202 million tonnes grading 0.30% copper and 0.06 g/t gold. The June 2023 PEA projects at 16 year mine life with average annual production of 95 thousand tonnes of copper and 49,000 ounces of gold in the first 14 years.</p><p>Costa Fuego is situated at low altitude and is in close proximity to all key infrastructure requirements. An updated resource is scheduled for late 2023 and will serve as the basis for a PFS, scheduled for completion in the second half of 2024.</p><p>Gibraltar Stream Increase (87.5% Silver Stream)</p><p>On June 29th, Osisko announced an amendment to its silver stream on the Gibraltar copper mine (\u201cGibraltar\u201d). Osisko and Taseko Mines Limited (\u201cTaseko\u201d) have amended the silver stream to increase Osisko\u2019s effective stream percentage by 12.5% to 87.5%. Further, the step-down silver delivery threshold has been extended to coincide with Taseko\u2019s recently updated mineral reserve estimate for Gibraltar.</p><p>Mantos Blancos Ramp Up (100% Silver Stream)</p><p>On May 3rd, Capstone Copper (\u201cCapstone\u201d) discussed its progress on the ramp up at Mantos Blancos, including continued focus on preventative maintenance to increase reliability and reduce downtime. Average throughput during the first quarter was 16,023 tpd (compared to 15,246 tpd in the fourth quarter of 2022). The quarter included eighteen days operating at 20,000 tpd and an average throughput rate of 19,000 tpd in February. On their first quarter conference call, Capstone indicated that higher throughput at Mantos Blancos is anticipated over the balance of the year. OBL expects to see stronger deliveries under the stream in the second half of 2023.</p><p>Capstone is currently evaluating the potential to further increase throughput of the Mantos Blancos sulphide concentrator plant from 20,000 tpd to 27,000 tpd using idled mill capacity with the potential for additional production through 2032. The Mantos Blancos Phase II feasibility study is expected to be released in the second half of 2023.</p><p>Eagle Ramp Up (5.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On July 5th, Victoria Gold Corp. (\u201cVictoria\u201d) reported second quarter production of 45,568 ounces of gold resulting in production of 83,188 ounces of gold during the first half of 2023. This represents a 47% improvement over the 56,413 ounces of gold produced in the first half of 2022. Both gold grade and metallurgical recovery continue to reconcile well against the Eagle reserve model. Island Exploration Success (1.38% to 3.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 15th, Alamos Gold Inc. (\u201cAlamos\u201d) reported new results from underground drilling at the Island Gold mine, further extending high-grade gold across the deposit, including several recently defined hanging wall and footwall structures in close proximity to existing underground infrastructure. Continued exploration success within recently defined sub-parallel structures demonstrates the significant opportunities to add high-grade ounces near existing mining horizons. This includes the newly defined NS1-Zone in the hanging wall which is currently being developed and mined; the zone is beyond existing Mineral Reserves and Resources and outside of the 2023 mine plan.</p><p>A total of $14 million is budgeted for exploration at Island Gold in 2023. For the past several years, the exploration focus has been on adding high-grade Mineral Resources at depth in advance of the Phase 3+ Expansion study, primarily through surface directional drilling. This exploration strategy has been successful in tripling the Mineral Reserve and Resource base since 2017. With a 17-year mine life, and with work on the expansion ramping up, the focus has shifted to an expanded underground exploration drilling program that will leverage existing underground infrastructure. The underground exploration drilling program has been expanded from 27,500 meters in 2022 to 45,000 meters in 2023 and is focused on defining new Mineral Reserves and Resources in proximity to existing production horizons and infrastructure including along strike, and in the hanging-wall and footwall. These potential high-grade Mineral Reserve and Resource additions would be low-cost to develop and could be incorporated into the mine plan and mined within the next several years.</p><p>Seabee Update (3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>During SSR Mining Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSSR Mining\u201d) first quarter conference call, it was mentioned that production during the quarter reflected an issue with underground equipment availability that negatively impacted the mine sequencing at Seabee. The issue was resolved, but grades processed were below expectations.</p><p>SSR Mining continues to advance near mine exploration at Seabee with a focus on prioritizing mineral resource conversion activities to ensure mineral reserve growth and mine life extensions in the future. They continue to evaluate early-stage exploration targets at depth below the existing Santoy mineralization as well as regional targets like Porky and Porky West that could contribute meaningfully to Seabee's longer-term production platform.</p><p>Lamaque Update (1% and 2.5% NSR Royalty)</p><p>During Eldorado Gold Corporation\u2019s (\u201cEldorado\u201d) first quarter conference call, management indicated that second quarter processing rates will increase slightly coupled with consistent grade and production for the second half of the year is expected to be stronger than the first half. Additionally, Eldorado is anticipating the delivery of the first electric haul truck in the second quarter and a second in the fourth quarter, which are expected to enhance haulage capabilities and reduce diesel consumption per tonne, lowering GHG emissions.</p><p>Eldorado also highlighted that exploration results at Ormaque continue to demonstrate the potential to increase resources. Partial results from resource conversion drilling will be incorporated in a resource update later in 2023 and a maiden reserve on Ormaque in 2024.</p><p>Renard Update (9.6% Diamond Stream)</p><p>On June 23rd, Stornoway made the decision to evacuate the Renard mine, located in central Qu\u00e9bec, due to forest fires located 50km to the northwest of the operation.\u00a0 Smoke from the fires as well as the closure of an important access road necessitated the interruption in site activities.\u00a0 Mining operations resumed on July 1st and the diamond recovery plant restarted on July 4th following the reopening of the access road allowing for the resumption of transportation of natural gas and diesel necessary for operations.\u00a0As a result of the temporary evacuation, we anticipate a moderate impact on deliveries from Renard in the third quarter of 2023; we also note a general softening in the diamond market over the second quarter due to high polished inventory levels and a slower economic rebound in China.</p><p>Pan Mine (4.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 21st, Calibre Mining Corp. (\u201cCalibre\u201d) announced assay results from the 2023 drill program at the Pan Mine in Nevada. Results at the Palomino target, located immediately south of the current open pit, indicate higher grades than the current average reserve grade of 0.4g/t gold. Currently a small amount of material at Palomino exists in Inferred Resources. The potential now exists to materially increase resource ounces, grade and confidence south of the Pan mine and the Palomino deposit remains open to the southeast and at shallow depths. Some highlight intercepts include 3.84 g/t gold over 15.2 meters, 2.08 g/t gold over 27.4 meters and 2.02 g/t gold over 27.4 meters. All drill targets are located near-surface in oxidized limestone. Given the proximity to the current open pit, and the fact that Palomino is within the permitted area, Calibre has indicated they could start mining at Palomino as early as 2024.</p><p>Windfall Joint Venture (2-3% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 5th, Osisko Mining Inc. (\u201cOsisko Mining\u201d) announced the suspension of all activities at the Windfall project due to the wildfire situation in Northern Qu\u00e9bec.

Highlights included 23.49 g/t gold and 58.79 g/t silver over 1.37 meters, 62.82 g/t gold and 231.46 g/t silver over 6.86 meters including 191 g/t gold and 707 g/t silver over 1.07 meters. Currently there are two underground diamond drill rigs in operation at Trixie conducting exploration activities.</p><p>Additionally, as of May 17th, approximately 75% of the Trixie portal and underground decline ramp had been completed and completion of the decline ramp to the main 625 level is anticipated by the third quarter of 2023, which is expected to significantly improve underground access for exploration drilling.</p><p>During 2022, Osisko Development completed an extensive review and compilation of historical data on the Tintic Project. As a result, a number of high-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver targets were identified at North Lily and Eureka Standard. Additionally, copper-molybdenum-gold porphyry targets were identified at Big Hill \u2013 a lithocap approximately 2 kilometers in strike length and 1 kilometer wide indicative of an underlying porphyry system. A strong geophysical and geochemical target was also identified to the West and at depth below Trixie. An initial program of surface drilling is planned to test Big Hill, commencing in the third quarter of 2023.</p><p>Cariboo Permitting Update (5.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On May 8th, Osisko Development announced the signing of two permitting agreements, the Process Charter and the Joint Information Requirements Table, reaffirming the multilateral support of and commitment by the various levels of the Government of British Columbia to advance the approval process of the Cariboo Gold Project (\u201cCariboo\u201d). The target timelines established by the Process Charter, which are contingent on the issuance of the Environmental Assessment Certificate anticipated in the third quarter of 2023, contemplate a final application referral date that is aligned with the anticipated receipt of environmental permits in Q1 2024.</p><p>Taylor Update (1% NSR Royalty on Sulphide Ores)</p><p>On May 8th, South32 Limited (\u201cSouth32\u201d) announced that the Taylor project had been confirmed by the United States Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), as the first mining project added to the FAST-41 process, enabling a more efficient and transparent process for federal permitting. The Taylor project, located in Southern Arizona, is currently the only advanced mine development project in the US that could produce two federally designated critical minerals: zinc and manganese. To qualify for the FAST-41 process, complex critical infrastructure projects must meet rigorous criteria to demonstrate benefit to the United States.</p><p>In a recent presentation, South32 indicated that the Taylor feasibility study and a final investment decision is on track for the second half of 2023 incorporating the revised mine development schedule, which is being optimized for the FAST-41 permitting process.</p><p>On April 23rd, along with quarterly results, South32 indicated that US$173 million had been invested at the project in the nine months ended March 2023. Construction of the second water treatment plant progressed and remained on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p>Casino (2.75% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On April 14th, Western Copper and Gold Corporation (\u201cWestern Copper\u201d) announced the closing of the $21.3 million strategic equity investment by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation representing approximately 5.0% interest in Western Copper, to further advance the Casino Project.

To date, 1.74 million tonnes of waste material had been excavated from the starter pit. Approximately 2.4 million tonnes of ore will be stockpiled during the pre-production period prior to mill commissioning, providing roughly 6 months of mill feed. Powerline progress has reached 41%.</p><p>On June 1st, G Mining announced it entered into a power purchase that grants Renewable Energy Certificates as assurance of the supply of renewably generated power. This will enable G Mining to produce gold ounces with Scope 1 emissions in the lowest quartile of the CO2 emissions curve when compared to similar operations in the Americas.</p><p>Marimaca Copper (1% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 20th, Marimaca Copper Corp. (\u201cMarimaca\u201d) announced a $20 million equity investment by Mitsubishi Corporation, representing a strong endorsement of the quality of the Marimaca Project. Proceeds from the investment will be used to advance and accelerate development and progress towards the feasibility study, as well as on project permitting initiatives.</p><p>On May 18th, Marimaca announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d) for the Marimaca Oxide Deposit (the \u201cMOD\u201d). Measured and Indicated Resources for the MOD are now 200 million tonnes at 0.45% total copper (\u201cCuT\u201d) for 900 thousand tonnes of contained copper, in addition to Inferred Resources of 37.3 million tonnes at 0.38% CuT for 141kt of contained copper. 86% of the MOD\u2019s total resource tonnes are now contained in the Measured and Indicated categories. The 2023 MRE incorporates 28,374 meters of new drilling data completed since the 2022 MRE released in October 2022. The MOD\u2019s unique characteristics were maintained in the 2023 MRE, including a low strip ratio within a single constraining pit shell. Marimaca has completed 5 phases of extensive metallurgical test work and a 6th phase of metallurgical testing is underway, which is expected to define the optimized process design flowsheet ahead of the planned feasibility study, which is now expected to be released in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>Akasaba West (2.5% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On April 27th, Agnico Eagle announced that work at the Akasaba West project commenced in September 2022 and remained on schedule for overburden removal in the first quarter of 2023, with over 670,000 tonnes of material removed to date. Construction of surface infrastructure is also progressing on schedule, including offices, a garage and water treatment facilities.</p><p>Altar Exploration Success (1.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On June 14th, Aldebaran Resources (\u201cAldebaran\u201d) announced the completion of the previously announced top-up financing with a subsidiary of South32. South32 elected to exercise its anti-dilution rights to maintain a 9.9% equity interest in Aldebaran following the exercise of warrants announced on May 5th, 2023.</p><p>On June 7th, Aldebaran reported results from its ongoing drill campaign at Altar. ALD-23-228 hit the favourable host rock formation at approximately 750 meters depth and thereafter returned some of the highest-grade copper mineralization encountered on the project to date, demonstrating continuity with previously intersected high-grade mineralization. Highlights include 565.6 meters of 0.60% Copper Equivalent (\u201cCuEq\u201d) from 676 meters depth in hole ALD-23-228, including 329.6 meters of 0.80 CuEq and 198.5 meters of 0.50% CuEq from 1,040 meters depth in hole ALD-23-227, notably the hole ended in 31.5 meters of 0.69% CuEq. As at June 7th Aldebaran had re-started drilling on hole 228 to see if the higher-grade mineralization continues to depth. Aldebaran indicated that four rigs are actively drilling with assays pending.</p><p>On May 31st, Aldebaran announced results from hole ALD-23-225B, drilled to test the continuity between mineralization encountered in previously released holes and to provide another pierce point into the promising geophysical anomaly that sits below and lateral to the current resources at Altar. Results included 1,056.2 meters of 0.56% CuEq from 291 meters depth, including 951.20 meters of 0.60% CuEq from 396 meters. This drilling fills a 400 meter gap between previous holes 223 and 224. The results are higher grade than the current average grade of the mineral resource and provide additional confirmation that the mineralized footprint of the Altar system is larger than previously understood. Figure 4 shows a across section looking towards the northeast displaying significant drill results that correspond with a large geophysical anomaly spanning the Altar East and Altar Central deposits.</p><p>Figure 4: Cross Section Looking Towards the NorthEast</p><p/><p>Source: Aldebaran Resources, May 2023</p><p>West Kenya (2.0% NSR Royalty)</p><p>On May 22nd, Shanta Gold Limited (\u201cShanta Gold\u201d) announced a company-wide exploration update, including drill plans from the West Kenya Project (\u201cWest Kenya\u201d) for 2023.

The Rhode Island 2020 State Forest Action Plan (SFAP) describes forest resources, identifies challenges and threats to forestland and its management, and establishes goals for investing resources where they can be most effective to achieve conservation goals.</p><p>\"Conserving and protecting forest resources is part of DEM's core mission and supports quality of life in the Ocean State,\" said DEM Director Janet Coit. \"Rhode Island's forests blanket over 50 percent of the state. From providing us with food to eat, paper for the books we read, and materials from which we build our homes and other products, our forests have tremendous environmental, economic, and cultural benefits.\"</p><p>The 2020 SFAP ensures the continuation of critical federal funding for the Division of Forest Environment's forest management programs. The Division works across the state with property owners and rural and urban communities on a wide range of forestry topics including forest heath, forest fire prevention, community and urban forest management, and private forest land management to maximize the positive benefits that trees and forests bring to all Rhode Islanders. In the 2020 Forest Action Plan, the national priorities to conserve, protect and enhance conserving these forest landscapes, both private and public, are essential to protect landscape functionality, habitat and environmental benefits.</p><p>Rhode Island's 386,373 acres of forest protect drinking water, improve air quality, mitigate climate change, provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, promote health, harbor wildlife, and create economic value. Seventy percent of Rhode Islanders get their drinking water from reservoirs protected by forests. Although DEM's Divisions of Forest Environment and Fish and Wildlife manage more than 57,000 acres of state-owned forests, forest land is predominantly held in private ownership. An estimated 38,000 families and individuals own 68 percent of Rhode Island's forest land.</p><p>Our forests face threats on multiple fronts: development leading to the loss and fragmentation, ease of spread of invasive plants and pests/diseases, loss of habitat, loss of economic and environmental benefits, and wildfire risk. Protecting RI's forest from these threats is a top priority of DEM's Division of Forest Environment's 2020 SFAP. The 2020 revision of the SFAP includes an assessment of the condition of trees and forests within state boundaries, regardless of ownership, along with strategies that address national forest conservation and protection goals. Rhode Island's SFAP, first completed in 2010, must be updated every 10 years as required by the 2008 Farm Bill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124337564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6281-2ST1-DYTH-G40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 19, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Welcome, everyone, to the Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. conference call and webcast on Thursday, May 11, 2023, discussing the recent Q1 2023 results press release.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I would like to introduce today's speakers, Mr. Brian Schmidt, President and CEO; and Mr. Steve Buytels, Vice President, Finance and CFO. (Operator Instructions)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Schmidt, you may begin your conference.</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, TAMARACK VALLEY ENERGY LTD.: Good morning, and thank you, Paul, and I welcome everyone to the call to discuss our first quarter operating and financial results. I'm joined here this morning with Steve Buytels, VP Finance and CFO.</p><p>Q1 was an extremely active quarter at Tamarack. At our peak, we had 9 active drilling rigs during the quarter. Success of our field program was highlighted by our exploration successes at Seal, Nipisi and West Marten Hills. The first quarter of 2023 represented the first full quarter of Tamarack having Deltastream assets under our control with the assets now fully integrated.</p><p>Operational and capital synergies are beginning to be realized as Tamarack executes our expanded Clearwater development program. These Clearwater assets continue to deliver at or above forecast at the time of the acquisition with additional upside and potential capital efficiency improvements being identified.</p><p>Today, I'm excited to share the results of our Clearwater Seal asset delineation activity highlighted by 3 stacked sands with all 3 brought on production through March, exhibiting IP30 rates of 380 barrels of oil per day combined. Two of the 3 wells, drilled with 6 legs, consistent with our drilling program, while one was drilled with 3 legs to test the productivity of that specific sand.</p><p>The 'C' sand produced over 206 barrels of oil per day, IP30, with the 'B' sand greater than 130 barrels of oil per day and the 'D' sand, our 3-legged well, had IP30 rates of 43 barrels per day.</p><p>So what does this mean to Tamarack? We have 17 sections in the area with 3 sands that present an incremental 7 sections with 2 sands of development potential at this time, which adds 16% to our overall Clearwater resource in place.</p><p>Putting this a different way, we see the opportunity to produce 2,200 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day with a 1.5-mile development where 3 sands are present with a total full cycle capital cost per section of between $35 million and $40 million, driving significant infrastructure and pad savings and capital efficiencies of approximately $13,000 to $15,000 per flowing barrel or less.</p><p>West Marten Hills continues to exceed the company's expectations, where production has grown organically from 400 barrels per day in Q4 '22 to over 3,400 barrels per day currently.</p><p>At Nipisi, we're deploying multilateral injectors with 2 of the 14 injectors as part of our waterflood expansion. The application of multilateral injection in this area is expected to significantly lower overall project cost while achieving similar recoveries relative to single leg schemes. The original waterflood pilot producer at Nipisi has produced, cumulatively, 180,000 barrels per date -- to date and the water cut remains stable at approximately 20%. After more than 500 days of production, this well is still producing 400 barrels per day.</p><p>At West Nipisi, the second well of our joint venture exploration program, exhibited peak IP30 rates of 175 barrels of oil per day, with the first well showing low decline, delivering an IP90 rate of 160 barrels of oil per day. Together, these results pushed the fairway of the 2 Clearwater sands further west. Tamarack expects future drilling on these lands given the success of the program.</p><p>Corporately, production for this first quarter averaged 67,938 barrels -- BOE per day, which represents a 64% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase of the fourth quarter '22. The success of our drilling and exploration program, however, was somewhat muted by an unplanned TC Energy pipeline outage in March, which reduced total quarterly production 1,000 barrels of oil per day. Adjusting for this unplanned third-party event, production for Q1 was on track to exceed budget expectations.</p><p>I'll now pass it over to Steve to run through the financial results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year.</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS, VP OF FINANCE &amp; CFO, TAMARACK VALLEY ENERGY LTD.: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter adjusted funds flow came in at $157 million, which was slightly impacted by the lower commodity prices and the wider heavy oil differentials that we saw through Q1. Further to this, we did deal with the Keystone pipeline apportionment, which impacted our wellhead differentials or realized heavy prices by about $1.70 per barrel relative to what we would see more on a normal run rate basis. But when we look ahead, the WCS differential has narrowed significantly from Q1, and we see very little to no apportionment. So as such, we'd expect wellhead price realization to narrow moving forward here through Q2 and then onward through the back half of the year.</p><p>On the operating cost side of things, we did have PPAs related to third-party non-op charges that hit in the first quarter. If we adjust out for those PPAs, our OpEx was at or below our guidance range, we continue to expect all of our guidance with respect to royalties, OpEx, G&amp;A and interest to be unchanged for the year and within the ranges that we have provided previously with our budget.</p><p>From a capital perspective, we spent $148 million in the quarter drilling, completing and equipping 32 Clearwater wells and 7.8 net Charlie Lake oil wells. We spent approximately $30 million on our major facility projects being the Wembley gas plant in the Charlie Lake and on our Nipisi pipeline and blending terminal. These projects remain on time and on budget and will drive significant OpEx and transportation expense reduction through the back half of the year, along with upside to our Clearwater netbacks at Nipisi through our blending terminal that will be in service.</p><p>These 2 initiatives have the potential to reduce the company's free funds flow breakeven by approximately USD 1 to USD 1.10 per barrel WTI moving forward and are key to enhancing the free funds flow generation over our 5-year plan. We also announced an update and extension to our sustainability linked bank facility. The facility has been expanded to $875 million from $700 million and extended to 2026, while the term loan has been reduced down to $200 million from $235 million.</p><p>Within our debt stack, we have reduced the deferred acquisition payments associated with the Deltastream acquisition by $93 million as that has been repaid -- and will continue to be repaid over the next 4 quarters. We continue to focus on advancing the rationalization of our asset base through the divestment of noncore holdings. This will help to accelerate debt repayment and get to our enhanced return thresholds.</p><p>Subsequent to the first quarter, we entered an agreement to sell approximately 400 BOE a day of noncore natural gas assets, which includes approximately $4 million of undiscounted abandonment liabilities. Further to this, we currently have our Redwater Viking assets in market and plan to continue to divest additional assets in an effort to core up our portfolio in the Clearwater and the Charlie Lake fairways.</p><p>With the ability to enhance our focus on these highly economic plays, we can capitalize on the successes we are seeing with our recent wells at West Marten Hills, which demonstrate a more than 30% improvement versus 2021. In addition, we continue to see success in the Charlie Lake where results are improving with execution over time and the installation of our first owned and operated gas plant will function to further enhance our economics by lowering our cost structure.</p><p>In terms of outlook, as mentioned earlier, our guidance remains intact with respect to the expense components for 2023. We have updated our production guidance for the year to reflect the noncore asset sale along with the third-party impacts in the first quarter volumes.</p><p>We will say we're still working through the Alberta forest fire situation. It does remain fluid here. And we will provide any material impacts or updates as that continues to provide more information.</p><p>Our CapEx guidance remains unchanged at $425 million to $475 million. However, given the volatility in the commodity space, we will remain flexible and continue to target the low to mid-end of the range for 2023 to ensure the balance sheet and debt repayment remains in focus.</p><p>I'm going to pass it back over to Brian here for some closing comments before we open it up for questions.</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Thanks, Steve.</p><p>While 2022 was the year that defined us as a Clearwater consolidator, 2023 is a year that will demonstrate our committed discipline to reshaping the asset base through exploration, rationalization to enhance profit margins, continue to pay down debt and position ourselves to grow free funds flow and return for shareholders. I want to thank our employees, Board of Directors, shareholders and stakeholders for all of your continued support.</p><p>I'll pass it back to the moderator for questions. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Okay. It appears there are no questions over the phone. I will now hand the call over to Mandy, who will be fielding some questions from the online platform. Please go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our first question is for Steve Buytels. Do you expect to look at any incremental M&amp;A in the foreseeable future?</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS: Yes. No, thanks. And that's a good question. I think as I just walk through here, we're going to focus in the short term here on accelerating the debt repayment. We did the Deltastream acquisition in the fall, which really cored up our Clearwater position. So now for us, it's going to be integrating and digesting that and then further rationalizing the portfolio. So I think if anything, that's going to be on more of the disposition side of our portfolio. And as I mentioned, we did a small deal here subsequent to the quarter, getting rid of some Southern Alberta shallow gas.</p><p>You're going to see us -- like I said, we've got another Viking package in the market right now that's being marketed. And then we'll look to move off some other noncore pieces that just don't compete for capital with respect to the Clearwater or the Charlie Lake.</p><p>So I think as we look into the -- through the summer and into the fall, we're hoping to have a few of those bigger assets out the door and come to investors with a nice reduction in debt and accelerate that enhanced return profile for the company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Brian Schmidt. Could you give us an idea of the time line regarding development at Seal?</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Yes. So it's pretty early on in the development. We'll be watching the well results that we see on a little bit longer term. And then in the meantime, we're going to be looking at some different kinds of well configuration. There's 1 zone there that's actually 12 meters thick. So we may be drilling 2 layers of wells, for example, in there.</p><p>Once we get the development plan consolidated, then we'll get our permits and get issued up there. I don't expect a lot of Seal development to happen here, maybe some in the late Q4, but most of it will be probably in the Q1 of '24.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Steve Buytels. At current strip prices, when do you expect to hit your debt thresholds and shift focus to return of cash flow?</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS: Yes. So obviously, with the commodity, with the WTI price coming off here over the last month or so, that pushes things out a bit, likely to Q1, I'd say, of next year, probably up earliest if you're looking at this sort of low $70 environment.</p><p>That being said, the differential has come in a lot, which provides quite a bit of sensitivity to cash flow for Tamarack here, given where over 50% of our production is heavy oil. So I think continued strength in that is going to help. But then more importantly, like I just got finished talking about, we are going to find ways, and we're committed to find ways to accelerate that debt repayment and get to those enhanced return thresholds as soon as we can.</p><p>So again, it's got to be the right business decision, a smart business decision. But again, we're still targeting to hopefully get there at some point in the back half of this year as we look at finding ways to bring additional proceeds in the door here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Brian Schmidt. Are there any plans to revisit Peavine with a different approach? Headwater is going back to their Peavine with fishbone-style drilling.</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Yes, that's a good question. And with the Peavine result that we had there, for those listeners that may not have been aware of the results, we ended up with a well with 40 barrels a day, hitting a zone where we had API gravities quite heavy. And that happens every once in a while in the Clearwater. It changes quite rapidly from section to section.</p><p>So for example, just to the south, there's a nice Baytex well that's got relatively lighter oil. So we think that moving east, we'll be doing some delineation drilling starting the end of Q4 and then into Q1, and that will just be a pilot hole and testing for zone thickness. And we'll probably get an idea on viscosity as well. So it's a low-cost way to delineate the resource and that's what we'll be deploying in Peavine. But we still see some good upside in Peavine. There's lots of areas where we've got nice, thick pay. And so look for more of that to continue here into '24.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Brian Schmidt. Can you talk about the methods you're using to advance decarbonization? And are there other methods you're currently exploring?</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Yes. So in terms of decarbonization, the best thing and most cost-effective system that we know right now -- the first year, we were doing things like changing transmitters in the field, the easy stuff. Getting a little harder now. Now it's gas collection and making sure that you're not venting or flaring gas. And when you have oil systems like that, these can be fairly costly to collect and put together. So the guys have put together a number of development plans that minimize our flaring in the field. And so those low-cost methods will be put into place here late this year into next year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Steve Buytels. Can you provide some details on your Viking package that's up for sale?</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS: Yes. The one that's in the market right now is our Redwater Viking assets. That would have been one of the first assets that Tamarack brought into the company over 10 years ago now. So again, it's in the market. We're not going to say much more than that. We'll see -- I think we should have bids in by the end of May there.</p><p>The one thing I will say on that asset, there is quite a bit of abandonment liability that comes with it. That's an old, old field. So again, part of what we're doing in rationalizing our asset base is cleaning up some of those old fields, too. And when you look at the way we look at our free cash long term, if you can get rid of a lot of that liability, that's millions of dollars a year that you're not having to spend on abandonment reclamation that can go back to shareholders and pay down debt and so forth. So that's the one that's helped there now.</p><p>As I mentioned before, we'll have some other bigger pieces, I think, coming, which will likely move the needle more from a proceeds coming in the door and accelerating that debt repayment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Brian Schmidt. Could you talk a bit about the type curve on the new Delta wells?</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Yes. So the former Deltastream assets, Marten Hills and West Marten Hills are the 2 areas where we've been doing some drilling on that acquisition. In Marten Hills, the curves are a meeting type curve. You might see something like in the first 30 days, a little choppy, and that's because the previous operator was not connecting those to pipe before putting them on production. And we start trucking out of those right off from day 1. So you'll see some choppy production month -- months -- in the first month. But after that, those -- we're finding that those wells are meeting or exceeding -- slightly exceeding type curve.</p><p>West Marten Hills is another story. West Marten Hills were actually up 33% on our type curve from what we thought we were going to do when we bought that asset. In fact, in that whole West Marten Hills area, we've taken production from 400 barrels a day up to 3,300 barrels a day. So that, and I know some of my competitors see that as a real -- a very good area that's going to be exploited by both of us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Steve Buytels. Are you seeing any shut-ins at this time due to the fires?</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS: Yes. And that's a good question. And I had a caveat that with this situation still remains fluid. And for us, the safety of our people, our staff, our operations is of utmost importance here. And so that's been our focus. So we have about, from a direct basis, 300 BOE a day shut in, again, that is strictly to make sure that we keep our staff safe and our infrastructure safe. That's the #1 piece.</p><p>When you look at the indirect component of the fires here, we have seen either pipes shut down or we've seen pipes backing up as companies are trying to do different things with flowing of volumes to try to get around some of the issues here. So all told, we've probably got about 1,000 BOE a day that's impacted, but that can change minute by minute, day by day. And like I said on earlier in the call, if anything changes materially that we have to get back to the market on, we will. But we're just monitoring it closely. And again, the safety of our people is the #1 priority.</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: And just let me add a little bit there. There's -- some of the indigenous communities that work there have been significantly impacted by fire. We are offering assistance to those communities. We've offered some services in the Slave Lake area to house people who are displaced from their homes. We also are aware of one community where they're isolated because the bridge burned down getting to their community, and we're going to be reaching out to -- for assistance there as well. So it's one thing to have your operations impacted, but people's lives are significantly impacted by some of these fires, and we'll be helping out where we can.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is for Steve Buytels. Could you talk a bit about current and forecasted free cash flow?</p><p>STEVE BUYTELS: Yes, you bet. And I think for a lot of you -- like Q1 and the way we operate in -- with the Clearwater being really a winter drilling program, Q1 is going to be our heaviest capital quarter, spending that $148 million. That's going to then be more balanced through Q2 and Q3, where we're probably in and around that $110 million to $120 million for Q2 and Q3 each quarter and then Q4 would round out to get you to that midpoint of that capital guidance range. So I think what you're really going to start to see here is Q2 and Q3 and Q4 really see that debt paydown start to come in.</p><p>But again, it's a little bit of a function of just the timing of being in the Clearwater in that winter program. We still see the better part of $300 million of free cash flow, $80 million of that goes to the dividend, obviously, annually. And then we're paying down debt and paying down the deferred acquisition payments here with respect to the Deltastream acquisition.</p><p>So again, we feel pretty comfortable with the assets. You can see the amount of free cash that they spin off even when you had differentials in the mid- to high 20s and WTI come off into the mid-70s. You can see the robustness of the assets and our free cash flow breakeven, including our base dividend of USD 37 WTI barrel, it's sector-leading, and we will lean on the resiliency of that, a little bit of patience here, obviously, with commodity prices in the short term, but where the dips come in, in terms of the tightening we've seen through Q2, Q3 and the back half of the year. We've got TMX coming on early next year and you look at the incremental refinery capacity coming on that's going to compete for heavy barrels at the Gulf Coast.</p><p>I think this heavy oil, this WCS story is going to be a pretty good story and have a lot of tailwinds here moving forward, and that's only going to help the free cash profile of this company moving forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Our next question is from Brian Schmidt. Could you just tell us about peer and industry collaboration regarding waterflood?</p><p>BRIAN LESLIE SCHMIDT: Yes. It's a good question on something that we're all very excited about. I think in total, there's about 9 different waterfloods going on in the Clearwater. Of course, we have 2 different designs in Marten Hills that we're deploying, and we have one design in Nipisi that we're deploying.</p><p>And all of us are watching each other's waterfloods. We're competitors where we need to be. But when it comes to waterflooding, there's pretty good collaboration between operators on how to do this. And you may find that we're all trying different kinds of designs in order to maximize the returns. So I expect that that collaboration will probably get even greater here as we go forward. And all the lands tied up, we know our primary results. So it's a good reason for us to collaborate on that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you. We have no more questions. We'll turn the call back to the moderator.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.</p><p>[Refinitiv, an LSEG business, reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

So glad Phil is here in a very still hazy New York.</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR/CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It's like borderline apocalyptic --</p><p>HARLOW: I know. My kids were kind of freaked.</p><p>MATTINGLY: -- and surreal. And it's actually very serious. I went down the rabbit hole of NASA scientists last night.</p><p>HARLOW: Of course you did.</p><p>MATTINGLY: And we have a lot to learn, talk about. And for those on the West Coast, who are like, welcome.</p><p>HARLOW: Welcome to what we've been living in.</p><p>MATTINGLY: This is a very, very real and significant issue.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And climate change.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, no question. HARLOW: In front of all of it. We'll get into all of what is happening here in the air in our skies. We have a lot of other news. Let's get started with \"Five Things to Know\" for this Thursday, June 8.</p><p>As we just talked about, another round of very thick smoke from these Canadian wildfires set to blanket pars of the Northeast and mid- Atlantic today. More than 75 million Americans facing alerts due to really poor air quality.</p><p>MATTINGLY: And sources tell CNN the Justice Department has informed Donald Trump's legal team that he is a target in the classified documents investigation. It's a sign that an indictment could be near.</p><p>And happening soon, Joran van der Sloot will leave his prison in Peru to board a flight to Alabama. He'll be facing fraud charges in connection to the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway.</p><p>HARLOW: Also, former Vice President Mike Pence delivering his toughest takedown yet of his former boss and now political rival. Pence saying Donald Trump should, quote, \"never be president again.\"</p><p>MATTINGLY: And Lionel Messi is taking his talents to South Florida. I like the LeBron connection there. In a surprise announcement, the soccer star said he intends to play for Major League Soccer in Milan.</p><p>CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.</p><p>HARLOW: OK. So let's begin here, though. Because I couldn't believe it when I looked out the window yesterday afternoon. It got a lot worse after we left the show.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes. It looked like we were on Mars.</p><p>HARLOW: It did.</p><p>MATTINGLY: But I think what was kind of -- the most surreal part, everybody in masks again.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Kids -- Outdoor activities being canceled down in Washington, D.C. My wife called and made clear kids --</p><p>HARLOW: Was it bad down there?</p><p>MATTINGLY: I don't think it's as bad as here.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MATTINGLY: New York City is being compared, air-quality-wise, to the absolute worst polluted cities in the world.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Delhi, places like that. It's -- it's a very real, very tangible issue right now. HARLOW: And a very important reminder of how important it is that we focus on the climate.</p><p>MATTINGLY: There's no question.</p><p>HARLOW: Climate change and all that is happening.</p><p>So this morning, you're waking up to this, likely, if you're in the Midwest or along the East Coast. Tens of millions facing a day of breathing in thick smoke from these Canadian wildfires, as it smothers the East Coast and the Midwest.</p><p>These are live pictures this morning, just after 6 a.m. Eastern here in New York City, where the air quality is so bad it is, this morning, the most polluted major city in the entire world right now.</p><p>Yesterday, as Phil head said, I mean, that's Manhattan, looking like the surface of Mars. You could barely see the skyline through the orange haze.</p><p>The bulk of this smoke is shifting to where Phil's family is, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.</p><p>Here's a look at some of New York's iconic landmarks, blanketed in this reddish brown. The governor calling it an emergency crisis. Hospitals saw an increase in patients with respiratory issues.</p><p>And this wildfire smoke isn't just a health problem. The blinding conditions led to a ground stop at New York's LaGuardia Airport with many flights either canceled or delayed.</p><p>Big sporting events, Broadway shows also canceled. Some public schools closed today. Others have canceled all outdoor activity.</p><p>Take a look at this time lapse of New York City and the skyline turning dark orange in the matter of minutes. A few hours -- over a few hours as waves of smoke continued to pour down from Canada.</p><p>Athena jones, our colleague and our friend, is again, live outside, masked up. It's worse -- or got worse yesterday since when you joined us on the show. What about today?</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy.</p><p>Well, here in New York, the smoke has abated somewhat. But it's still at an unhealthy level, which is especially bad for sensitive groups.</p><p>Now, officials have warned, things could worsen again later in the day. It's the same pattern we saw yesterday. But as you noted, the bulk of the smoke that hit New York is expected to shift South to affect Baltimore and Washington, D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONES (voice-over): From New York --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very, very scary. Just walking down the street and feeling like I'm going to have an asthma attack.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): -- to Lansing, Michigan --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've noticed a little bit of a difference, you know, with being able to breathe right. Coughing more.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): -- to Washington, D.C., and even as far South as Raleigh, North Carolina, unhealthy air blanketing a large swath of the United States.</p><p>[06:05:10]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, man! That's fire.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): From over 400 active wildfires burning in Canada as of Wednesday afternoon. More than half of them determined to be out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Last year and this year, the worst wildfire season we've ever had right across the country.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Canada's wildfire season got off to an intense start in May, and it's unusual to see so much destruction this early. It picked up aggressively this month, largely in Quebec.</p><p>More than nine million acres have burned in Canada so far this year, 15 times the normal amount. Smoke from those fires traveling hundreds of miles, affecting cities all across New York state.</p><p>GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): This is the worst air quality we've experienced in over 20 years. This is hard to breathe right now.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Gov. Kathy Hochul said New York state is making one million N-95 masks available to the public, due to ongoing poor air quality that could be harmful for everyone, or even hazardous for some.</p><p>ZACHARY ISCOL, NYC EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMISSIONER: I know that times like this can be scary. It can be shocking for many New Yorkers when you step outside, when you smell and breathe this air.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): New Yorkers being urged to stay indoors as much as possible, because particles in wildfire smoke can infiltrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Too much smoke inhalation has linked to conditions like asthma and heart disease.</p><p>DR. ASHWIN VASAN, NYC HEALTH COMMISSIONER: The best protection is to avoid being outside until the air clears.</p><p>JONES (voice-over): Officials warning the smoke will continue to impact much of the East Coast until at least the weekend.</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: I want to be clear: while there may be potential for significantly improved conditions by Friday morning, smoke predictability that far out is low.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES (ON CAMERA): With that in mind, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said that, while they expect conditions to improve, possibly by this weekend, that doesn't mean it won't happen again.</p><p>As one of our CNN meteorologists put it, this could be something we deal with off and on throughout the remainder of the summer. Fire season is just beginning in Canada -- Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow. Off and on through the remainder of the summer. Athena, thank you very much. I know it's not easy conditions, being out there, for you and your team. We appreciate the reporting.</p><p>MATTINGLY: We want to drill in a little bit on what Athena was just saying. We want to bring in meteorologist Derek van Dam for the latest forecast on where the smoke is moving.</p><p>Derek, I think the biggest question right now across the East Coast, when is relief coming?</p><p>DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. Phil, you know, it is all dependent on the wind direction. Right?</p><p>Where it's bad for somebody today, it's going to be worse for somebody else tomorrow, depending on exactly that wind direction. So, this morning we are waking. As Athena noted, some improvement on the visibility. But of course, still hazardous air in New York City.</p><p>But look at Philadelphia. Just over a mile of visibility. More of the same for Washington, D.C. And, you know what? We've already talked about this. But this is incredible to note. New York City topping the list of the most polluted major cities across the entire planet right now, as of 5:55. We just updated that.</p><p>So what is this air quality index that we keep talking about? Well, this is the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency's way of communicating to you and I the quality of the air that we breathe.</p><p>It uses these color codes to help convey that message, and it also explains to groups how they may be impacted.</p><p>So if we're talking about 200 to 300 AQI index, we're talking very unhealthy. Now, look at that hazardous purple color. That's 300 to 500 AQI index. And for a point there on Wednesday evening, Philadelphia, New York City and Trenton all in that hazardous air.</p><p>Now, you see these dots. These are all the reporting stations for the AQI index. Several purple. Several reds. Bottom line, what you need to know: it is very unhealthy air that we're breathing. And it is all thanks to the wildfire smoke to the North.</p><p>But check this out. As we progress this near surface smoke forecast, you can see how it clears from New York City. But then, just as I mentioned at the beginning of this broadcast, it will shift to a different location. The Ohio River Valley, parts of the Great Lakes. Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati. You've got the potential for more smoke and unhealthy air as the wind pattern shifts ever so slightly -- Poppy, Phil.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Derek van Dam with the latest, thanks so much.</p><p>HARLOW: Also this morning, new developments in one of the many investigations facing former President Donald Trump.</p><p>Sources say the Justice Department has told Trump's legal team that he is a target of Special Counsel Jack Smith's criminal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.</p><p>This target letter is really the clearest signal yet that Trump is facing a possible indictment. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and argues he declassified everything while he was president.</p><p>Our colleague, Evan Perez, joins us now. What does this mean? People will wake up. They will hear \"target letter.\"</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: They will want to know what does that indicate?</p><p>PEREZ: Good morning, Poppy.</p><p>Well, we haven't been here before. This is a really big moment, certainly, in all of these investigations of the former president. Even during the Mueller investigation, prosecutors really -- and the investigators never really got this close to saying that they were going to, or possibly going to, indict the then-sitting president. Right? Or that he was guilty of some kind of crime.</p><p>And so what has happened now in recent weeks is that Donald Trump has been officially notified that he is a target of a criminal investigation. And look, that was pretty obvious already to the former president, given the fact that the FBI got a search warrant. They searched his property at Mar-a-Lago. In that -- in the search warrant, they described a list of three crimes that they were investigating.</p><p>So, he has known that he is front and center. He's the only one, obviously, who, you know, was willfully retaining these documents, despite the fact that the -- the National Archives and the federal government were trying to retrieve this.</p><p>So that what happens next is that the former president has the right to present some evidence to prosecutors, saying that he should not be charged. He can go to the -- ask to go speak to the grand jury to present his side of the story.</p><p>We do not anticipate that the former president is going to do that.</p><p>Again, this is a step that the Justice Department has at its disposal. They don't have to tell people that they are the target of a criminal investigation. But they can do that, and it usually -- usually -- indicates that they are close to bringing charges against that person. MATTINGLY: Yes, it very clearly seems to be moving in that direction. One question I had, though, Evan. Our stellar show team picked up what seemed to be a new defense last night from a former Trump attorney when it comes to the documents themselves. I want you to listen to it.</p><p>PEREZ: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIMOTHY PARLATORE, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: Simply the fact that it has a classification marking on it, if it does have a classification marking on it, doesn't make it automatically some type of contraband. It has to be national defense information, one. Two, under the Presidential Records Act, we're talking about original documents. Not a single one of those marked documents are originals. They're all copies. Every single one of them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTINGLY: All right. I'll bite. Because I'm admittedly a little bit perplexed, not a PRA expert, but you are.</p><p>HARLOW: Presidential Records Act.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Whether you want to be or not. Evan --</p><p>PEREZ: Yes.</p><p>MATTINGLY: -- do you think there's validity to that?</p><p>PEREZ: No. I don't think that what -- I think what he's trying to do is to try to say that, certainly, these documents that were brought to Mar-a-Lago, that, well, they don't matter, because they are copies of the originals which, of course, the federal government knows what documents Donald Trump likely took, because they have the originals. In most cases, they have the originals of these documents.</p><p>And the fact that you copied these documents doesn't make it not classified, doesn't make it not national security information, right? I mean, in fact, it creates and opens new questions. You know, who copied them? Did that person have a right to copy them? Those are the new questions that are opened by this line of defense.</p><p>Parlatore also said that, you know, essentially, that the -- he has previously said, rather, that it doesn't matter whether the documents are classified or not. That it's national defense information.</p><p>He's right about that. Because that is exactly the crime that -- the crimes that the Justice Department says that they're investigating right now the former president for possibly violating.</p><p>And, so, the fact that things are copies, really just makes them new documents that the government wants to retrieve. Right? If you go into a meeting with Donald Trump and he says things that are classified, and you take notes, that document suddenly becomes a record that needs to be returned to the National Archives -- guys. HARLOW: Yes. Fascinating and so important, Evan. Thank you.</p><p>MATTINGLY: True.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss is Jennifer Rodgers, a CNN legal analyst, former federal prosecutor.</p><p>Jennifer, you've noted that this development, the targeting letter development, suggests prosecutors are close to a charging decision.</p><p>Again, to Poppy's point, for people who are reading the front page of the newspaper this morning and see charge letter, see kind of what seems to be a methodical progression in this investigation, what should they be thinking about what's coming next?</p><p>JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think we're at the end, Phil. I mean, I think we know now why the Monday meeting was triggered between Donald Trump's defense team and DOJ. They likely got this target letter last week and said, Oh, hold on, we want to come in and talk you to. That's probably why that meeting happened.</p><p>MATTINGLY: So what Evan was saying in terms of they will now have an opportunity to come in and kind of give their case, or give their side of things. This target letter likely can cause that. Which they may have done in the meeting.</p><p>RODGERS: I think -- I think that's right. And these are things that happen at the end kind of when the investigation is wrapping up. DOJ will send this target letter, give the person an opportunity to appear in the grand jury if they wish to do so. Give them an opportunity, if they want, to come in and pitch why the person shouldn't be indicted, and then it's all wrapped up. Time to decide and go to the grand jury for the indictment.</p><p>[06:15:09]</p><p>HARLOW: Is it rare that someone would not be indicted following a target letter?</p><p>RODGERS: It is. It is. Usually, they have their mind made up at the time that the investigation is wrapping up and they've seen and evaluated all the evidence. I mean, every once in a blue moon, maybe a defendant's lawyer will raise something in the meeting that causes them to rethink, or perhaps to downgrade charges that they had been considering.</p><p>But for the most part, by the time they've collected all the evidence, they know what they want to do.</p><p>HARLOW: That's a big deal. Every -- every once in a while is not great odds for the former president here, then.</p><p>RODGERS: For sure. For sure. I mean, I suspect we'll see an indictment fairly soon.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Can I ask you, one of the -- I don't want to say complicating factors, but different factors, obviously. This is a special counsel investigation. There is separation from the attorney general. But the attorney general still has oversight of what's happening at this point in time.</p><p>Take us behind the scenes at DOJ. What are the conversations going on right now, given there is no precedent for this? And what the attorney general, what Jack Smith, the special counsel, may be thinking through at the moment.</p><p>RODGERS: Yes, you know, we haven't gotten much insight into what's happening inside of DOJ. You know, he will have to keep the attorney general, you know, generally apprised of what's happening. But we don't know how often they've been meeting, how detailed these meetings are as far as the information going to the attorney general.</p><p>And I suspect that Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith in the first place so that he wouldn't really have to be involved in the day-to- day, of course.</p><p>So Jack Smith and his team, of course, have been working to put all of this together. When they feel like they're at a point where they have made their internal decision as a team, of course, they will relay that to Merrick Garland and his folks and talk it through.</p><p>But I would be very surprised if Merrick Garland is going to overturn the decision of Jack Smith and his team on this.</p><p>HARLOW: One of the developments we learned this week is that there is a second grand jury. And it's in South Florida, in Miami. And \"The Washington Post\" reporting yesterday on this was really interesting, that many of the -- if there are these indictments, if they're multiple, a lot of it is going to stem from -- from Florida, rather than Washington, D.C.</p><p>RODGERS: Yes. That was a big surprise, because everything has been happening in D.C.</p><p>You know, it could be that they are planning to indict one, two, or a few people down in Florida for kind of more minor-level actions having to do with the obstruction piece. You know, people who were moving documents, for example, or the surveillance tapes, that sort of thing. And they're just peeling those off to handle in Florida.</p><p>Or it could be the whole thing is going to happen in Florida. I mean, that's really where most of the conduct occurred here. It's where the documents we know were possessed for so long. Hidden, you know, certainly the basis of the obstruction is down there.</p><p>So they may have decided for venue purposes that the whole thing should be in Florida. But we just don't know that yet.</p><p>MARLOW: Can I ask -- you know, I asked Evan about this. I'm kind of fascinated by the idea that a copy of a classified document, I'm not really -- I'm not totally pulling the thread together on what that might mean. Because it still seems like it would be classified information. Your view? Evan kind of laid out and knocked down, to some degree, what President -- former President Trump's former attorney detailed in terms of that defense. What's your read on it?</p><p>RODGERS: So if that's going to be their in-courtroom defense, as opposed to the magical declassification things that we've heard from Trump outside of the courtroom --</p><p>HARLOW: Quite an evolution, by the way.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: From I did it with my mind to it's photocopies, so it's OK.</p><p>RODGERS: yes. If that's going to be their legal defense in court, then it's going to be a short jury deliberation. That -- that's not much of a defense.</p><p>It's helpful to think about it in different buckets. I mean, there are statutes that prohibit having and disseminating national defense information. And that doesn't have to be in the document. That's just information. Right?</p><p>There are statutes that talk about classified information that is classified, stamped with the word \"classified.\" That's a different bucket.</p><p>And then there are things that the Presidential Records Act requires the National Archives to keep. And that has original documents somewhere in it. So like, for example, the letter that was handwritten from President Obama to President Trump, the National Archives wants that. It belongs to the government.</p><p>That thing, sure, if they made a copy of it and kept it somewhere, that's not going to be a violation.</p><p>But classified information is classified. Even if there are ten documents that are all the same, that all say \"classified,\" they're all classified. You can't have any of them. National defense information, same thing.</p><p>So there's no defense here to anything that the special counsel is considering charging. So, I think that when they finally do get into the courtroom, that is not what we're going to hear from them.</p><p>MATTINGLY: There's a voluminous history of people who have had classified information for whatever reason, were charged, and the classified information was copies or photos. Or anything --</p><p>HARLOW: I was just thinking about that case against Jack Teixeira right now.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes.</p><p>RODGERS: Well, you might make ten copies. Right?</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>RODGERS: Some stay at the CIA, one goes to the White House. One goes to a congressional committee.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, even throughout the government there are copies.</p><p>RODGERS: All classified.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Jennifer Rodgers, thanks so much.</p><p>HARLOW: Great.</p><p>So House Speaker Kevin McCarthy facing revolt from a group of his own party.

It was great.</p><p>RODGERS: Thank you, guys.</p><p>HARLOW: Nice to have you and get to have an actual --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Well, this morning, Mike Pence is now the first vice president to directly challenge the president who picked him as a running mate. Just hours after launching his campaign, Pence participated in a CNN town hall, where he tried to cast himself as an experienced and traditional conservative while hitting former President Trump over immigration, Vladimir Putin, and his actions prior to the Capitol insurrection.</p><p>Our Kyung Lah is live in Des Moines, Iowa, with more. Appropriately, wishing the vice president happy birthday there, as he made the announcement on that day.</p><p>What's the reaction been from the people in Des Moines? KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we can tell you is that it's -- it's really something that the people, the voters here, the Republican Party, has got to square a difficult dance that Mike Pence is having to make.</p><p>And you really saw it on display at the CNN town hall. A man who was once Trump's deputy, now taking him on in a party that's been reshaped by Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Former Vice President Mike Pence launching his campaign for president in Iowa, taking questions and shaking hands with voters at a CNN town hall on his 64th birthday.</p><p>[06:25:02]</p><p>PENCE: It's one for the books.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Right out of the gate, Pence is disputing former President Donald Trump's claims he could have overturned the results of the 2020 election.</p><p>PENCE: I felt that he was -- he was asking me to choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution. And I always will. President Trump was wrong then. He's wrong now.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): The relationship between Trump and Pence fell apart on January 6th, when rioters stormed the Capitol, calling for Pence's execution.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Trump says he would consider pardoning some of the rioters. Pence disagrees.</p><p>PENCE: I have no interest or no intention of pardoning those that assaulted police officers and vandalized our Capitol.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Pence had this to say about roughly a dozen number of classified documents he found at his residence in Indiana in January.</p><p>PENCE: I immediately informed the Department of Justice, and I'm grateful, after our full cooperation, that they concluded that it was an innocent mistake.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): But stopped short of saying Trump should be indicted by the special counsel for his alleged mishandling of classified documents.</p><p>PENCE: This kind of action by the Department of Justice, I think would only fuel further division in the country. And let me also say, I think it would also send a terrible message to the wider world.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): The former vice president also differentiated himself from Trump on foreign policy.</p><p>PENCE: When Vladimir Putin rolled into Ukraine, the former president called him a genius. I know the difference between a genius and a war criminal. And I know who needs to win in the war in Ukraine. And it's the people fighting for their freedom.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Pence also signaling to conservative voters that he is their candidate.</p><p>PENCE: Well, I strongly support state legislation including, as we did in Indiana, that -- that bans all gender transition chemical or surgical procedures for kids under the age of 18.</p><p>LAH (voice-over): Pence joins a growing field for the Republican nomination, including North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. And former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie launched another bid for the White House, making the cornerstone of his campaign rebuking Trump.</p><p>Trump, in response, posted this video mocking Christie after the announcement.</p><p>CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It just renewed in my own mind what a child he is. He's a baby. Whenever you want to criticize him, I mean, in any way, that's the way he responds.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAH (on camera): And we were sitting in and above the audience during the CNN town hall with Mike Pence and really got a sense of the reaction as some of those toughest lines against Donald Trump were delivered.</p><p>And something to just note, Poppy, is that those were not his strongest, biggest applause lines. And we also saw that in his kickoff rally in Ankeny, Iowa. Is that the crowd, some of them, stood up, applauding. Others didn't applaud at all and remained seated.</p><p>So that really underscores the challenge ahead for the former vice president.</p><p>HARLOW: It -- it says it all, I think, Kyung, for sure. How much do you run on who you are and what you stand for and how much do you run against your former boss? Thank you very much.</p><p>So, ahead in our 7 a.m. Eastern hour, we're going to be joined by North Dakota governor, now presidential candidate, Doug Burgum. He's going to join CNN this morning, live.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Well, he's awake. He's making jokes, and he's already back at work. The latest on the pope's condition after undergoing surgery.</p><p>HARLOW: And look at this. Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted and produced lava that bursts that reached to, like, 200 feet into the air. The largest lava fountain is consistently reaching about 50 feet. And these are live pictures.</p><p>Officials say the eruption is happening within a closed area of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. And right now, no threat to the locals.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[06:30:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023060801CNV27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DR-B921-JCS1-629B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4878\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS459420 GIFT, NOVELTY, AND SOUVENIR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS512110 MOTION PICTURE &amp;

A good rain Wednesday night, throughout the day on Thursday and chances of rain Friday as well justified the lifting of the burn ban.</p><p>\"We don't want to have to drag it out any more than we have to, because we know it hinders people's everyday lives and the burn ban violations can impact the public financially,\" Green added.</p><p>Green also said, due to sandy soils and fuel types in the area, fire season never truly ends for Scotland County.</p><p>\"As we transition into the summertime weather pattern, only a few days of hot and dry conditions can dry us out in a hurry,\" said Green. \"No matter how much rain we receive, residents should always ere on the side of caution when burning. Keep your water hose, shovels and rakes close by.\"</p><p>When it comes to campfires, burn pits and even charcoal disposal, Green said it is important to remain cautious.</p><p>\"Rake around all burning pits and campfires and when finished with the festivities, drown the coals with water,\" said Green. \"Stir everything up and drown again until there is no residual heat in the area. We have seen an above-average number of fires caused by charcoal disposal this year as well.</p><p>\"Please make sure that all coals are cold before dumping and avoid dumping them in the woods if possible,\" added Green.</p><p>As July 4 approaches, Green voiced concerns as the possibility of fireworks begin to arise.</p><p>\"When shooting fireworks, please make sure that again a water hose or other fire suppression tools are nearby so everyone can have a fun and safe holiday,\" said Green. \"We appreciate the understanding and the cooperation we received throughout the duration of the burn ban. We experienced fire danger levels that have never been seen before and damage remained minimal. However, as stated earlier we are not out of the woods yet, no pun intended. We must remain cautious.\"</p><p>The North Carolina Forest Service has lifted a ban on all open burning for the following counties in North Carolina: Anson, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Carteret, Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Duplin, Greene, Harnett, Hoke, Jones, Lee, Lenoir, Moore, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pender, Pitt, Richmond, Robeson, Sampson, Scotland and Wayne. The burn ban went into effect May 24 due to hazardous forest fire conditions in the area.</p><p>JJ Melton can be reached at [email protected]</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Laurinburg Exchange (Laurinburg, N.C.)

As the search continued Tuesday, people found the crocodile with the teenager's corpse in its mouth, The Times of India reported.[1] <br/>The police had found the crocodile Monday, but were unable to catch it.On Tuesday, rescue teams used boats and nets to capture the crocodile. However, the reptile escaped after dropping the body in the water. <br/>Earlier, search teams had found the victim'sfootwear near the banks of the river, the News Minute reported.[2]The body of the boy was missing a hand and there were several injuries to his head, the local police said. <br/><br/>While speaking to local media, forest officials said crocodilescannot eat their prey beneath the water, which is why they come to the banks to consume it. Sometimes, they also hide their prey under the water and eat it after the corpse decomposes. <br/>Locals complained the area was infested with crocodiles, due to which sometimes children even destroyed eggs laid by crocodiles. Locals and tourists have been urged by the forest officials not to fish or go swimming in Kali river. <br/>Last month, a huge crocodile[3] in the state of Uttarakhand was founddevouring the body of a man, who had been missing for three days. The victim was identified as Sukhdev Debu. An official in theSurai forest range said it remains unclear if the man was killed by the crocodile, or if the reptile ate the corpse after he died due to some other reasons. The crocodile was first spotted eating the corpse by a man in Raghuliya village, who had gone to the area to drive away some monkeys.'When he reached his farm, he saw a crocodile eating a person near a pond. He immediately informed the other villagers and a crowd gathered at the spot. Village head Gurmej Singh informed police and forest officials about the incident, following which Surai forest range team rushed to the spot and found that the crocodile devouring the dead body,' Kundan Kumar, divisional forest officer of Terai East Forest division said at the time. <br/> representational image Photo: pixabay <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/body-of-15-yr-old-snatched-by-croc-recovered/articleshow/87287797.cms\">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/body-of-15-yr-old-snatched-by-croc-recovered/articleshow/87287797.cms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/teenager-karnataka-dragged-river-crocodile-search-underway-156899\">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/teenager-karnataka-dragged-river-crocodile-search-underway-156899</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/huge-crocodile-devours-body-man-missing-3-days-3296299\">https://www.ibtimes.com/huge-crocodile-devours-body-man-missing-3-days-3296299</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Most reasonable people would agree that after years of what appeared to be remarkable success in containing the virus, China's COVID-19 situation has turned to outright disaster. <br/>Following the government's sudden and unplanned dropping of strict quarantine and testing rules, hospitals in even the biggest and richest of the country's cities, starting with Beijing, have been overrun. Patients struggling to breathe or showing other signs of distress are seeking urgent care. <br/>Drugstore shelves throughout the country have been emptied of all medicines related to fever and cold symptoms. The few vetted, prescription antiviral COVID-19 treatments available in much of the rest of the world, such as Paxlovid, are almost impossible to find; when available, they cost an arm and a leg. Ambulance services are completely overstretched by the deluge of emergency calls. And crematoriums operating around the clock cannot keep up with the number of cadavers being delivered in body bags. <br/>I imagine few will be prepared for the conclusion that follows. The COVID-19 crisis in China is not primarily a public health crisis. In fact, it could be argued that even on its present course, in public health terms, China will not come out of the current emergency phase as a global outlier in terms of the numbers of people killed by the pandemic and may even be counted as having done reasonably well. The real scene of the COVID-19 disaster in China is to its once confident and seemingly unshakable political system. <br/>Three years ago, China's early response to COVID-19, characterized by extraordinary lockdowns affecting big cities and even entire subregions, struck many people around the world (especially in affluent countries that place a priority on personal freedoms) as crude and even brutal. This first phase of what became known as country's zero-COVID policy was followed, or more accurately supplemented, by the implementation of mass testing regimes that became more and more obsessive and even invasive in nature. <br/>As I have written before[1], this was clearly not a way out of the pandemic. It was obvious all along to anyone with even a basic understanding of epidemiology or public health that once this regime was lifted, COVID-19 would spread in China just as it had in most other parts of the world. What the long experiment with lockdowns and endless mandated testing and tracking apps arguably accomplished was a postponement of the day of reckoning\u2014until less deadly strains of the virus, as many believe Omicron and its sub-variants to be, had become prevalent. <br/>I lived through the worst of the pandemic in an utterly devastated New York City, when the city's infection rate was five times[2] higher than the rest of the country (nearly 44,000[3] people have died in the city due to COVID-19 as of Dec. 27). In those days, depressingly, the incessant sound of ambulances, sometimes several at a time, drowned out everything else. <br/>Had China taken something like the U.S. response at the outset of the pandemic, with few quarantine measures or other social controls, one imagines an even worse catastrophe, given that the country has ten cities roughly as large as New York (or much larger), and over 100 cities with more than a million residents. With no specific treatments for COVID-19 yet available, zero native immunity, and an early strain prone to murder, there is no telling how many people would have died. <br/>In the United States, impressively effective vaccines were rolled out in December 2020, representing an extraordinary triumph of sheer science that helped make up for the grave and persistent weaknesses of the U.S. public health system. I eagerly made an appointment and was grateful to receive my first shot of the new mRNA vaccines in early January 2021, and I kept getting boosters whenever I could (currently, up to five total shots). <br/>As a matter of pride, or rather a deep-seated but foolish sense of nationalism that is incessantly drummed into the public by the country's leaders, China failed to introduce foreign-made mRNA vaccines, instead pursuing a native vaccine breakthrough. This same mistake was made later, when antivirals effective against COVID-19, such as Paxlovid, were not widely imported, produced, or distributed in China because they were of Western origin; China's rulers often rigidly insist on having native solutions even to problems that have been long solved by others. <br/>Much has been written about how China squandered the time bought by its quarantine and surveillance efforts by neither pushing for a much higher vaccination rate in the country, especially among the vulnerable elderly, nor stockpiling antivirals or even ordinary fever medicines. But there were very real practical obstacles that stood in the way of near universal vaccinations. <br/>China spent much of the past three years using the pandemic for crude propaganda purposes. Simply put, the rest of the world was getting sick, and China was not. The West, in particular, was afflicted with untold ravages from long COVID-19. The Chinese public was inundated with messaging, both direct and indirect, that concluded that the West's troubles proved China's overall system superior, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) the best possible guardian of people's welfare. And in a land where actual COVID-19 cases were few and far between throughout most of this period, getting the public to line up for shots and then more shots, was a very hard sell. (Just think about how hard it has been to get elderly U.S. citizens, who live in a country where COVID-19 has never gone away, to get the latest boosters.) <br/>Add to this indifference the fact that many Chinese people\u2014nationalist state propaganda be damned\u2014have had little faith in the country's home-grown vaccines. Outside of China, too, much has been made about the country's inferior vaccines\u2014perhaps a bit too much. There is little doubt that Western vaccines, particularly those using mRNA technology, are more effective than China's shots, which use older designs. But there are reasons to believe this difference in efficacy, much emphasized in Western coverage and perhaps even acknowledged by Chinese citizens who lack trust in their own system, is substantially overestimated, at least in practical terms. Although the Chinese vaccines are lower performing, staying up to date with repeated doses nonetheless appears to provide substantial protection against the worst effects of a COVID-19 infection\u2014that is, hospitalization and death. <br/>This brings us to the true nature of the ongoing catastrophe in China. The current situation is a self-dealt hand suffered by the CCP that both underpins and stands above the state, and the issue is trust. In the annals of self-ridicule, it would be hard to beat Beijing's COVID-19 Dec. 21 death toll. In the face of overwhelming anecdotal evidence[4] to the contrary, the government insisted that almost no one had died due to the forest fire-like spread of the disease. <br/>But this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br/>Up until the very moment of the policy turnaround, the Chinese public had been inundated with messages about why zero-COVID was necessary, why they needed to submit to ceaseless PCR tests and even invasions of their homes. The propaganda masters are failing, even now, to come up with a good explanation of the government's reversal, much less a statement acknowledging that grave mistakes were made at the very top. <br/>There was a time not so terribly long ago when suffocating censorship and national isolation made it possible for the propaganda system to brush aside inconvenient facts and incriminating narratives. In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings, the CCP masked the facts of what happened through sheer fabulation. The cover story offered by former Communist party chairman Deng Xiaoping for the massacre of hundreds of people at that monumental square in the heart of Beijing was that 'a few released prisoners who were not properly reformed, a few political hooligans, the residual dregs of the Gang of Four[,] and other social detritus' were responsible for the violent disturbance that swept China's capital, and that it had all been instigated by 'hostile foreign forces.' Someone deemed that the lily needed further gilding, though, so the propagandists stressed that the soldiers who had carried out the killings were the true victims and filled televisions for days with images of soldiers recovering in hospitals and wreckage of charred army vehicles. <br/>But that era has passed. The present crisis signals the advent of an entirely new epoch, one that has been long in coming. No, this is not a prediction of the pending demise of a system of government that many had believed until only recently to be formidable. (I must add here a macabre thought: From the Chinese state's point of view, the COVID-19-induced deaths of hundreds of thousands of people over the age of 65 might even have their benefits. That's because the country is embarking on a globally unprecedented wave of aging[5] that will drastically reduce the size of the workforce and make paying for so called entitlements, or long term health care for people with chronic diseases and retirement benefits, vastly more onerous. A large number of relatively quick deaths, eliminating the need for decades of dialysis or dementia care, for example, might be counted as a fiscal and actuarial blessing.) <br/>Serious foundational cracks are now on display, reminders that even a state that relishes control is susceptible to losing it. In my more than 20 years combined of living in, traveling to, and working extensively on China, I have never seen the credibility of the state and of its propaganda messaging dip so low. What is different from the era of Tiananmen and of other previous crises is that Chinese society has become increasingly dominated by a big and growing middle class. It is much more educated than before. And despite Beijing's unstinting efforts at information control, people now receive much more news from sources of all kinds, whether domestic or foreign, through formal or informal networks. Big questions loom about whether the country's political system in its present configuration can endure without major reforms. Will the CCP be able to retain control only at the expense of an exodus of vast numbers of talented Chinese, and a slowing of middle-class economic growth? <br/>The frontlines to watch are threefold. To what degree can the state abide the truth? Can it ever acknowledge its mistakes? And how much criticism can it allow from its own citizens, the overwhelming majority of whom are patriotic? What seems certain is that the state's customary guise of all-knowing, never erring, and not accepting independent thinking has never fared worse. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/28/china-protests-urumqi-fire-zero-covid-xi-jinping/\">https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/28/china-protests-urumqi-fire-zero-covid-xi-jinping/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/new-york-new-jersey-coronavirus-attack-rate-is-5-times-higher-than-rest-of-us-top-official-says.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/new-york-new-jersey-coronavirus-attack-rate-is-5-times-higher-than-rest-of-us-top-official-says.html</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page\">https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-totals.page</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/world/asia/china-covid-death-toll.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/world/asia/china-covid-death-toll.html</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/chinas-twilight-years/480768/\">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/chinas-twilight-years/480768/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/12/28/chinas-government-is-a-self-made-covid-19-victim/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FOPO133089167225044642025876100162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOPO-133089</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6766-SF71-JCMN-Y13T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2060\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Foreign Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Argument</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Authoritarianism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pandemics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Eighteen of the recipients are projects benefiting mountain biking trails. These mountain biking projects received a total of $581,087 in funding from the program, which local organizations have prepared to match through additional fundraising. The 18 projects are expected to address 170 miles of deferred maintenance, 208 miles of trail construction and improvement, and will build and repair 21 bridges and 46 culverts, all through the help of nearly 2,000 volunteers who will dedicate an estimated 31,809 volunteer hours to trails.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Legacy Trails Grant Program is a great display of how trails and recreation aid in conservation,\" said David Wiens, International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA) Executive Director. \"Not only do these projects have great components for mountain biking and for all trail users, but every project takes strong strides to protect and steward the surrounding environment, for its intrinsic value and so communities can cherish the great outdoors.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mountain biking is an environmentally low-impact activity that aids in protecting and enjoying open space, and IMBA promotes sustainable trails to minimize impacts on the environment, natural resources, and wildlife.</p><p>Summaries are below for this year's 18 awarded projects that benefit mountain biking in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming.</p><p>This pilot grant is available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in November 2021, one of many funding opportunities for recreation and conservation that the outdoor community has successfully advocated for throughout the past several years. The Legacy Trails Grant enables IMBA Local Partners and other non-profit organizations to complete trail projects which improve watershed health, restore aquatic organism passages, preserve trail access, and/or decommission unauthorized and previously closed trails through restoration. Projects can include NEPA planning, trail clearing, brushing, tread repair, trail relocation, bridge and structure repair or replacement, and installation of trail signs provided they contribute to the goals of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p><p>IMBA encourages IMBA Local Partners and other trails organizations to review the program and consider potential project eligibility prior to the 2023 application cycle.</p><p>American Trails is the lead manager for this program, working collaboratively with IMBA and other trail groups to review and select projects that will provide an overall benefit to the National Forest System lands and trails network. Collaborating groups on the application review team include the National Wilderness Stewardship Alliance, the American Hiking Society, the Back Country Horsemen of America, the National Off-Highway Vehicle Conservation Council, Tread Lightly, and the American Motorcyclist Association.</p><p>2023 GRANT RECIPIENTS BENEFITING MOUNTAIN BIKING TRAILS:</p><p>Chugach National Forest, Alaska</p><p>Partners: American Hiking Society</p><p>Project: The Lost Lake Trail project consists of rebuilding a step-and-run structure to reduce erosion and provide a durable surface when the nearby swamp is full of water. Additional trail maintenance will also be completed.</p><p>Trails: Lost Lake Trail and a portion of the Iditarod National Historic Trail</p><p>St. Francis National Forest, Arkansas</p><p>Partners: Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism - State Parks Division</p><p>Project: The Storm Creek Connector Trail will connect Storm Creek Campground and Storm Creek Day-Use Area via an authorized trail designed by Arkansas State Parks. The goal of the project is to convert an old National Forest Service road and several unauthorized user-created trails into one authorized, well-designed, and properly signed trail that connects the two areas. This project will introduce trails and trail advocacy to an historically underrepresented population and likely can be a catalyst for additional trail development for hiking, trail running and mountain biking in this area.</p><p>Trails: Storm Creek Connector Trail</p><p>Inyo National Forest, California</p><p>Partners: Friends of the Inyo, June Lake Trails Committee, Mono County, the Inyo National Forest, and DeChambeau Creek Foundation</p><p>Project: The Twenty Lakes Basin Roads and Trails enhancement project proposes to restore more than three miles of unauthorized use trails that damage wet, alpine meadow habitat, and address deferred maintenance on nearly ten miles of heavily used system trails in the popular Hoover Wilderness of the Inyo National Forest. By restoring erosive, undesignated, user-created trails through sensitive meadow habitat and enhancing existing system trails, the project reduces the ecological impact of the designated trail system and improves user experience. User-trail restoration will directly enhance meadow and watershed function to benefit documented breeding populations of federally threatened Yosemite Toad, as well as enhance one of Mono County's most popular and easily accessible backcountry angling destinations sporting four species of trout. The project will benefit three public water systems, as well as a major hydroelectric generation reservoir.</p><p>Trails: Saddlebag Lake Trail</p><p>Los Padres National Forest, California</p><p>Partners: Sage Trail Alliance, Santa Ynez Band of Chumash, Boy Scouts, U.S. Forest Service, additional local volunteer groups</p><p>Project: The Buckhorn and Indian Trails within the Santa Barbara Ranger District of the Los Padres National forest make up 8 miles of singletrack trail that follow a creek drainage from the upper Santa Ynez River to the headwaters of Little Pine Mountain. The once-IMBA EPIC trail and ecosystem have experienced multiple natural disasters including forest fire and debris flows, rendering the trail unusable for nearly two decades. This project is a shining example of restoring American trail legacy with the intent to restore watersheds on public lands. Mountain bikers are coordinating with conservationists on Wilderness access, partnering with Tribal Communities to protect heritage, and working on federal legislation to preserve the region. When completed, this trail will tie into a greater network of trails to complete a 40-mile backcountry network.</p><p>Trails: Buckhorn Trail</p><p>Los Padres National Forest, California</p><p>Partners: Los Padres Forest Association</p><p>Project: As a National Recreation Trail, the Santa Cruz Trail should be the pinnacle of what the National Forest Trail System has to offer the public. Unfortunately, due to the destructive 2016 Rey Fire, the Santa Cruz Trail is in disrepair. This project will restore the southern 5.4 miles of the popular and beloved Santa Cruz Trail to provide centrally located trail access for mountain bikers, hikers, and equestrians. This project, through erosion control and restored access, will also provide long-lasting protection for the endangered Southwestern Arroyo Toad and California Red-legged Frog, as well as watershed protection for Santa Barbara County citizens.</p><p>Trails: Santa Cruz Trail</p><p>Tahoe National Forest, California</p><p>Partners: Western States Trail Foundation, Western States Endurance Run, U.S. Forest Service</p><p>Project: A primary goal of this project is to reduce frequency of maintenance needs while providing public access and safety. Work will improve a section of trail on the National Register of Historic Places within the Tahoe National Forest trail system along the Western States trail. This special area has major cultural and heritage resources, threatened and endangered species, natural resources, and native plant communities. It is in need of extensive repair due to rapid water runoff, flooding, debris flows, rockfall and increased erosion, all exacerbated by damage from the 2022 Mosquito Fire.</p><p>Trails: Western States - Deadwood to El Dorado Canyon</p><p>Medicine Bow - Routt National Forest, Colorado</p><p>Partners: Routt County Riders</p><p>Project: The Soda Ditch Loop Trail is a popular connector and loop-access route based out of the busy Dry Lake Campground and parking area vicinity of Buffalo Pass. For cyclists, it is often used on the return from the further-flung Soda Mountain Trail or Grouse, both expert-level backcountry experiences for riders and other trail users. There are several low points in the trail that have become eroded, muddy, and dangerous to trail users as they widen the tread trying to \"go around\" the wet spots. The aim of this project is to reduce negative impacts to water quality and sensitive soils by constructing simple timber bridges over the wet and eroded sections.</p><p>Trails: Soda Ditch Loop 1020.1</p><p>Caribou Targhee National Forest, Idaho</p><p>Partners: Mountain Bike the Tetons</p><p>Project: The Horseshoe Canyon trails project includes replacing a dilapidated bridge with a trail structure to reduce erosion and sediment flow into the main drainage of Dude Creek; perform trail tread improvements and augmented drainage. The standard of the trails in this area needs to be updated using contemporary trail design and building practices to improve overall resiliency. The work will accomplish improved overall water quality within the Dude Creek drainage, reduce sediment erosion and improve the overall sustainability. Improving the water quality in Dude Creek drainage, which feeds into the Teton River, will ultimately improve the habitat for the Yellowstone Cutthroat trout. Improving adjacent trail tread and augmenting drainage in the area will reduce deferred maintenance and also reduce soil erosion and sediment within the Dude Creek watershed.</p><p>Trails: Horseshoe Canyon Trail System</p><p>Superior National Forest, Minnesota</p><p>Partners: North Superior Ski and Run Club (NSSRC)</p><p>Project: The Pincushion Trails rehabilitation project will reduce erosion and improve the resiliency of infrastructure in a critical watershed of Lake Superior. Pincushion Trails are situated at the top of a ridge along Lake Superior, overlooking Grand Marias. The trails traverse many drainages and small tributaries necessitating numerous bridges and culverts. As these drainages, creeks, and streams merge, they encounter the ridge parallel to the Lake Superior shoreline, gaining energy and momentum as they drop in elevation and flow into Lake Superior. Rehabilitating the trails will correct the problems with ditches, drainages, and culverts, reducing the amount of maintenance needed and ensuring the trail is open for recreationists to enjoy. This project will eliminate deferred maintenance and improve to standard 8.5 miles of the 16+ mile trail system.</p><p>Trails: Pincushion Mountain Trails</p><p>Beaverhead-Deer Lodge National Forest, Montana</p><p>Partners: Montana Conservation Corps</p><p>Project: Montana Conservation Corps (MCC) trail crews will work during the 2023 field season to repair and restore trail surfaces and secure multi-use trails that are susceptible to erosion and flooding in their current state. This work will be carried out using construction and repair techniques that aim to reduce sedimentation into waterways, resolving deferred maintenance over 89.9 miles of trail and making a profound improvement on instream sedimentation for the benefit of sensitive species including West-slope Cutthroat trout and Arctic Grayling. This will be accomplished by restoring heavily eroded tread and repairing or replacing water bars and puncheon as needed. Crews will work under the supervision of both USFS and MCC field staff to help ensure that priorities are being met and construction projects are executed correctly.</p><p>Trails: Pioneer Loop National Recreation Trail and Pettengill Creek #245</p><p>Pisgah National Forest, North Carolina</p><p>Partners: G5 Trail Collective, SORBA Northwest North Carolina Mountain Bike Alliance, Wild South, Backcountry Horsemen of the Blue Ridge</p><p>Project: This work will restore and protect key areas of the Catawba River headwaters within the Grandfather District of Pisgah National Forest, while simultaneously improving trail access and the trail user experience. Work will address water quality issues caused by erosion and sedimentation over years of deferred maintenance and flooding. Impacts along 40 miles of trails and nearly 60 stream crossings will be restored and repaired by relocating specific trail segments away from streams, hardening stream crossings with armoring, replacing bridges and culverts, and improving trail sustainability with enhanced grade reversals and grade dips.</p><p>Trails: Upper Wilson Ridge, Middle Wilson Ridge</p><p>Uwharrie National Forest, North Carolina</p><p>Partners: Friends of Uwharrie</p><p>Project: This project along the Dickey Bell Trail will reroute a section of trail to protect an archaeological site, improve drainage to reduce erosion, and revegetate old trail tread to improve the nearby watershed to positively impact water quality. A clear and sustainable trail reroute will help prevent unsanctioned trail creation around a steep hill climb that is susceptible to erosion.</p><p>Trails: Hang Glider Summit Loop</p><p>Ochoco National Forest, Oregon</p><p>Partners: Heart of Oregon Corps</p><p>Project:The HOC conservation crew will focus on converting 6.47 miles of non-motorized winter trails to allow for summer use. Creating a tread,18-36\" wide, will allow access for hiking, biking, and equestrian use. This process will also include establishing or rerouting the trails to avoid impacts on seasonal wetlands and riparian areas, as well as the creation of crossings and drainage to foster natural water flows. The existing 5.6 miles of all-season trails need retread work completed to mitigate erosion, flooding, and impacts to streams and wetlands.</p><p>Trails: Bandit Springs Trail System</p><p>Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Oregon</p><p>Partners: American Hiking Society</p><p>Project: Participants on this project will construct erosion control structures on the Imnaha River Trail, which will allow the trail to be more resilient to extreme weather events. It will also prevent excessive sediment from entering the Imnaha River, improving watershed conditions for sensitive species. Work will include brushing and constructing trail drainage features such as water bars, French drains, and possibly turnpikes.</p><p>Trails: Imnaha Trail</p><p>Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania</p><p>Partners: American Hiking Society</p><p>Project: On this project, 10 Alternative Break college youth volunteers will work closely with Forest Service staff to complete the rebuild of the Beaver Meadows trail bridge through a beautiful meadow abounding with wildlife and recreational opportunities. The work will include removing old and decaying wood, rebuilding decking, nailing boards down and installing railings. American Hiking Society's Alternative Break program provides young adults from diverse backgrounds and experiences an opportunity to perform trail stewardship work, develop leadership skills, and gain valuable conservation knowledge. In the Alternative Break program, 42% of participants self-identify as BIPOC and 61% identify as female or non-binary.</p><p>Trails: Beaver Meadows Trail</p><p>George Washington Jefferson National Forest, Virginia</p><p>Partners: Back Country Horsemen of the Virginia Highlands</p><p>Project: The Virginia Highlands Horse Trail follows along and crosses four creeks in the 8.2-mile project area. Trail tread has become severely entrenched in many areas, concentrating water flow down the trail and drainage problems have created areas of standing water. In an effort to reduce sedimentation and runoff, trails will be realigned, where possible, to better distance trails from the streambeds. Where realignment is not possible, or further efforts are required, trail tread and prism will be armored or stabilized with cribbing (timber or stone) walls to stabilize out-slopes and reinforce creek banks. The sustainable repairs that BCHVH has planned for this 8.2-mile section will go a long way to reduce sediment that flows into the New River Watershed, a source of drinking water for southwest Virginia and West Virginia.</p><p>Trails: Virginia Highlands Horse Trail and Iron Mountain Trail (Comers Rock Section)</p><p>Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest, Washington</p><p>Partners: Methow Valley Trails Collaborative, Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance</p><p>Project: Installing trail bridges in accordance with the U.S. Forest Service standard drawings will make for sustainable creek crossings that keep trail users out of flowing water. These stream crossings will prevent erosion. Because the Cutthroat trail is a high-use trail, the bridges have been identified by recreation staff as high-priority bridges to be replaced immediately after they are decommissioned. In addition to protecting aquatic habitat, this project will help improve the habitat for White Bark Pine by performing deferred tread maintenance towards Cutthroat Pass. This maintenance will reduce trail braiding in the White Bark Pine habitat. The White Bark Pine is a keystone species that supports wildlife and watershed health when it is present in the ecosystem. This project will protect the habitat of native West slope Cutthroat Trout by reducing stream bank erosion and keeping sediment out of streams.</p><p>Trails: Cutthroat Trail and Louis Lake Trail</p><p>Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming</p><p>Partners: Bridger-Teton National Forest, WY</p><p>Project: The Black Canyon Drainage Improvements project involves adopting a series of user-created trails that have formed in the wide nordic grooming corridors near the Trail Creek trailhead. Trails that make up five loop options on sustainable corridors will be adopted and improved. Trails that are unsustainable or lead to dead ends or private property will be closed and rehabbed. Significant maintenance on the Black Canyon trail will also be executed. Portions of the Black Canyon logging road will also be converted into trails. Additionally, invasive species mitigation will take place at the Trail Creek trailhead to prevent their spread further onto the national forest.</p><p>Trails: Black Canyon, Big Rocks, and OPR Loop trails</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imba.com/press-release/legacy-trails-grant-mountain-bike-projects-2023\">https://www.imba.com/press-release/legacy-trails-grant-mountain-bike-projects-2023</url></p><p>[Category: Sports]</p><p>Contact: Eleanor Blick, Director of Communications, 720/900-4622, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:eleanor.blick@imba.com\">eleanor.blick@imba.com</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8074785 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8074785</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67JV-2R31-JC11-148S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3064\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
