According to news originating from Marwadi University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires have become a significant research subject among national and international communities due to increasingly favorable climate conditions characterized by prolonged periods conducive to forest fires. However, several studies have been developed worldwide to assess forest fires' conditions, frequency, and intensity.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Marwadi University: \"Still, the literature is not transparent globally for forest fires impacting climate or the climate affecting the forest fires. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review using bibliometric analysis and synthesis of the effects of climate change on forest fire activity throughout 2003-2023. The bibliometric data has been collected from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The results reveal that the USA and Canada occupy the leading positions in maximum production of scientific output with the highest documents and contain the most productive authors' institutes and well-known scholars or authors. Co-authorship overlay analysis showed that Flannigan, M. D. (2.08%) and Bergeron, Y. (1.18%) were the most productive authors with maximum citations and the highest H-index (15 and 11). In addition, we investigated the research strengths of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their sub-areas at the country and institute levels. Also, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to determine the percentage of literature that contributes to addressing forest fires and climate change in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) throughout the study period. The observation suggests that the existing body of literature significantly contributes to SDGs related to environmental sustainability and climate resilience.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Also, the assessment of the literature's impact on SDGs achievement and awareness spans from 2005 to September 2023. Most earlier studies in this domain demonstrated a significant commitment to SDG 13 (Climate Action), constituting 83.049% of contributions with 886 published documents.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire consequences under the influence of changing climate: a systematic review with bibliometric analysis in the context of sustainable development goals.

Masks provide some protection against harmful smoke particles and chemicals released when plastics, upholstery and synthetic building materials burn.</p><p>This week, the forest agency announced it has stockpiled roughly 80,000 N95 masks and will include them as part of the equipment it provides for large fires.</p><p>The decision came after a series of New York Times reports that detailed the Forest Service's decades-long refusal to require, or even offer, masks to its crews, despite recommendations from state and federal health agencies, and a growing body of evidence that wildfire smoke is harming firefighter health.</p><p>\"To provide masks, and even require masks, is an implicit admission of the health hazards of smoke,\" said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology, an organization that promotes the health and safety of wildland firefighters.</p><p>Ingalsbee and others say the Forest Service's reluctance to encourage mask wearing was probably motivated by concern it would be admitting that smoke poses dangers and risks to its crews.</p><p>Research shows that firefighters have a 9% higher risk of getting a cancer diagnosis than the general public, and 14% higher risk of dying from cancer. Crews may be exposed to smoke and other toxins believed to cause cancer, such as benzene, phenols and heavy metals, while fighting fires.</p><p>Federal lawmakers are now working on safety legislation to protect federal and contract wildland firefighters, and have sent a series of letters to the Forest Service criticizing what they call its decades-long neglect.</p><p>Reports suggest that \"that federal agencies are neglecting their duty to protect the health of wildland firefighters,\" wrote Reps. Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael), Maxine Dexter (D-Ore.) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) in a letter to Forest Service chief Tom Schultz. \"Neglecting the health of current firefighters will make future recruitment harder and leave our communities vulnerable.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, they grilled Schultz at a House oversight meeting.</p><p>Huffman urged Schultz to warn workers about the dangers of smoke exposure: \"Chief, do you feel like the Forest Service is doing everything that it can to make the safety risk of smoke inhalation known to firefighters?\"</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection also announced Tuesday that the state will be funding research designed to examine how smoke and other occupational exposures may increase cancer risk in firefighters.</p><p>The research, which includes a collaboration among scientists and experts at UCLA, UC Davis and Cal Fire, is backed by nearly $9.7 million in state funding and will include 3,500 firefighters from departments across the state over a two-year period.</p><p>The study comes at a time when the Trump administration has made drastic cuts to cancer research.</p><p>\"It's California at our best: our world-class public universities teaming up with the women and men who put their lives on the line to protect others -- all in an effort to improve health outcomes for all,\" Newsom said in a statement.</p><p>The study will include a focus on the exposures and biological changes that occurred in firefighters who responded to the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.</p><p>Ingalsbee said that masks are not always appropriate when fighting fires -- there are activities, such as traipsing up and down steep terrain when a N95 mask can get gummed up with debris and sweat and make it difficult for a firefighter to breathe. However, he said, the vast majority of the time, when firefighters are at their base camps, where it's often smoky, or driving along dusty, sandy roads, masks could go a long way to protect their lungs, reducing exposure.</p><p>\"There are times when masks are unsuitable and firefighters overheat and they are uncomfortable,\" he said. \"But there's a lot of times when they'd be very useful in limiting their exposure. And maybe could save some lives.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: U.S. FOREST SERVICE firefighter Alan Gudino, right, shields his face while battling the Madre fire in July.

The EFFIS data shows a sharp increase in forest fires between August 5 and 19, a period that coincided with a 16-day heatwave on the Iberian Peninsula.<br/>The heatwave ended last week, after fueling fires that killed at least eight people in the two countries and forced the closure of roads and rail services.<br/>However, ten forest fires are still active in the Castilla y Le\u00f3n region of Spain, where around 700 people have been evacuated, while flames continue in the northern regions of Galicia and Asturias.<br/>In Portugal, cooler temperatures have brought some relief, and a fire in Pi\u00f3d\u00e3o was extinguished on Monday after 12 days. With more than 60,000 hectares burnt, Pi\u00f3d\u00e3o is the largest forest fire ever recorded in the country.<br/>Climate change is making forest fires, heatwaves and droughts more frequent and severe, although prevention measures, such as clearing dry vegetation, have played an important role in controlling fires.<br/>Forest fires in the EU have emitted 38 million tons of carbon dioxide so far this year, according to EFFIS. This is more than in the same period of any year on record, putting 2025 on course to break the annual record of 41 million tons.<br/>(Additional reporting by Andrey Khalip and Inti Landauro)<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72420173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BPK3-RS5Y-N31F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Geral</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The EFFIS data shows a sharp increase in forest fires between August 5 and 19, a period that coincided with a 16-day heatwave on the Iberian Peninsula.<br/>The heatwave ended last week, after fueling fires that killed at least eight people in the two countries and forced the closure of roads and rail services.<br/>However, ten forest fires are still active in the Castilla y Le\u00f3n region of Spain, where around 700 people have been evacuated, while flames continue in the northern regions of Galicia and Asturias.<br/>In Portugal, cooler temperatures have brought some relief, and a fire in Pi\u00f3d\u00e3o was extinguished on Monday after 12 days. With more than 60,000 hectares burnt, Pi\u00f3d\u00e3o is the largest forest fire ever recorded in the country.<br/>Climate change is making forest fires, heatwaves and droughts more frequent and severe, although prevention measures, such as clearing dry vegetation, have played an important role in controlling fires.<br/>Forest fires in the EU have emitted 38 million tons of carbon dioxide so far this year, according to EFFIS. This is more than in the same period of any year on record, putting 2025 on course to break the annual record of 41 million tons.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">*Reproduction of this content is prohibited.</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72420253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKM-BPK3-RS5Y-N32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 26, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Giro</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

I have hiked the Gifford Pinchot National Forest for decades and it is sad to see it become more and more choked with brush. Large grazing meadows have disappeared, leaving little habitat for wildlife to use.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>Professionally managed logging, contrary to Sen. Maria Cantwell's erroneous comments, mitigates both carbon and forest fire concerns. Mature trees hold the carbon they've drawn in, but their ability to continue to draw in carbon is almost nil. But the young trees planted after logging will increasingly draw carbon for about 50 years.<br/>A patchwork of recently logged and aging logged areas greatly reduces forest fire risk by having gated roads allowing quick response by firefighters and a reduction in the current 2 million acres of brush-choked forest.<br/>John H. Roscoe<br/>Battle Ground<br/>Keep Perez in Congress<br/>Who in this congressional district wants to elect a Republican who will pretend to heed electors' needs? One who will kowtow to the greed and mistruths popular among today's Republicans? One who will take away our health care, vaccines, education, due process, and raise prices of just about everything and kill our democracy?<br/>Who will elect that Republican? Those Democrats, progressives and nonthinkers who do not vote at all because some of Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez's votes are stuck in their idealistic craws. Or vote for an alternative who cannot win, who will take votes from the incumbent Democrat.<br/>Earlier in Perez's career, I too was disappointed in her votes. She reasoned the bills wouldn't fix the root of the problem, and I agreed with her, but not her votes.<br/>Anyone who pays attention to politics knows the first years of new legislators are a steep learning curve. Those who have followed Perez recently have seen her begin to understand she must represent the entire district, as well as what it means to honor her oath to protect our democracy.<br/>We must keep her in the House. Give her more opportunity to develop. Vote for Marie.<br/>Marj Casswell<br/>VANCOUVER<br/>Adhere to Third Commandment<br/>Many letters to the editor quote Scripture to justify their beliefs. The MAGA cult often justify their positions as \"ordained\" by Jesus   Trump being the model of Christ in action.<br/>In that spirit, let's look at the very Ten Commandments they want to lead our school curriculum, justifying many hateful positions as they interpret \"scripture\" and advocate for persecution of nonbelievers.<br/>Refer to Commandment No. 3, which is often interpreted as simply a prohibition against cursing. There is much more. For those who justify their actions as \"God-given,\" they should show caution when using the \"Lord's name in vain.\"<br/>As you circulate messages of anger and hate, exclusion and revenge   justification for the elite entitled white Christians, reflect on the \"law\": The commandment is directed against the abuse of the name of God, where God's name is used to support the truth of the statement being sworn to. Think about this as you post or speak, citing God as support   is that a sin?<br/>Judy I. Veazie<br/>VANCOUVER<br/>Support Garber for charter review<br/>The charter review commission is an elected group of citizens who review the county charter and place amendments on the ballot to improve the structure of local government. This nonpartisan role requires commissioners who prioritize county citizens over politics.<br/>Cathie Garber fits this description. Cathie was Clark County elections director for 14 years, giving her a deep understanding of how local government operates within the framework of state laws and our Constitution. Her background includes working with Democrats and Republicans, demonstrating her ability to collaborate with individuals holding different viewpoints.<br/>We need Cathie Garber on our charter review commission.<br/>Les Stark<br/>LA CENTER<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8631481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H2N-SWK3-RRKB-N0XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Columbian Publishing Co.

But I will say this: a working forest is a great way to mitigate forest fire risk.\"\u00a0</p><p>The deputy minister said timber cutters use forestry roads that act as fire breaks and that they work on parcels of land that have forests of various types and age classes that have less fuel load than virgin, old-growth forests do.</p><p>Chris Norfolk, the assistant deputy minister, told Conroy he had looked at different inventories of New Brunswick's woods over the years. The oldest he found, the first comprehensive inventory of its type, showed that in New Brunswick in 1954, about 43 per cent of the woods were primarily softwood.</p><p>Today, that figure sits at 43.5 per cent, not much different than 71 years ago, despite the use of herbicide spraying, tree planting and modern silviculture practices.</p><p>He acknowledged at a local level that can look very different some plantations have virtually no hardwood because of efforts to eradicate it, whereas in the past forests that were primarily softwood also had hardwoods mixed in.</p><p>And Norfolk admitted he wasn't sure what burns fastest - the natural Acadian forest, which has 32 native species of trees, versus pure softwood plantations.</p><p>Most of the research on forest fires and what burns fastest and hottest has been conducted in Central and Western Canada, the official said.</p><p>\"We need a better understanding how our local fuel types, including plantations and other areas that have received silviculture, how they behave when we experience forest fire conditions like the ones we've experienced this summer,\" Norfolk said.</p><p>To that end, the department has received conditional funding from Ottawa over the next couple of years, in partnership with the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, to study the problem through what Norfolk called aliving lab model.</p><p>Herbicide spraying in New Brunswick's public woods is a hot topic. The chemicals have been widely applied over the past decades by timber firms, the railways, the military and the public electrical utility NB Power to kill unwanted vegetation on vast tracts. Some people fear they could harm humans and wildlife.</p><p>The officials told the committee that the timber and paper industries need herbicides to keep costs in line. Often called New Brunswick's cornerstone industry, wood products are worth more than $3 billion in annual exports. The industry, directly and indirectly, employs about 26,000 people, often in smaller communities where jobs are otherwise scarce.</p><p>The department officials said they followed Health Canada's lead on herbicides. Its studies show that if the spray products are used according to the label, they are safe.</p><p>In addition, the province has put on extra layers of safety to try to address public concerns. For instance, it recently increased the setback for aerial spraying from homes from 155 metres to 500 metres, although a request by the all-party committee in 2021 for it to be a one-kilometre setback has been ruled out.</p><p>The officials pointed out that companies are forced to post signs stating when they sprayed on trails that lead into the woods. About 15,000 hectares are re-planted and sprayed each year, at a cost of $3 million to taxpayers. To put that in perspective, one football field is about one hectare.</p><p>Companies that operate in the woods say the chemicals help because they prevent unwanted vegetation from growing, and they're much cheaper to apply than physically cutting and removing all that plants.</p><p>For example, timber firms use them in selected areas to help a new tree stand grow to a certain height without facing competition from what they consider weeds. Newly planted areas are generally sprayed once, sometimes twice as red maples are harder to kill than most deciduous trees.</p><p>Rail companies apply them to clear the sides of tracks, to prevent accidents and wildfires.\u00a0</p><p>NB Power once was a big user of glyphosate underneath its nearly 28,000 kilometres of powerlines but since 2023, it has discontinued the use of glyphosate-based herbicides. However, it continues to use other herbicides in limited quantities along transmission rights of way.</p><p>Still, herbicide opponents are frustrated that some recommendations made by the committee four years ago are only now being acted upon. A study that was supposed be done within 12 months comparing the cost of herbicide spraying with manual cutting won't be completed till March 2027. That's a six-year timeline.</p><p>\"I would like them to explain why they didn't do the work we asked them to do,\" Green MLA Megan Mitton told reporters afterwards. \"The cost-benefit analysis and how to do that transition is really important.\"</p><p>Natural Resources Minister John Herron, who sat listening during the committee session, told journalists that his Liberal government had only been in power 10 months.</p><p>\"We've made some progress over the last couple of months,\" he said. \"I come from a background or tradition where legislators and parliaments matter and giving proper attention to legislatures and committee reports is the work of government. Having more speed, having more fulsome answers is a good thing.\"</p><p>However, Herron defended the use of herbicide spraying, saying he'd follow the science. He did not explain why his department had refused to increase setbacks from homes to one kilometre, one of the committee's demands, only pointing out that the biggest timber firm in New Brunswick, J.D. Irving, Limited, had told him it already uses a one-kilometre minimum setback.</p><p>He said he hadn't spoken to other timber firms about the issue and didn't know what kind of setbacks they use.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-a5761711ccf148ed9752a2f2012d2d30</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GSB-6DN3-RRPP-X4NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>10:19 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 17, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This marks a sevenfold increase from the average of the previous two years.</p><p>According to the study published in Biogeosciences, 3.3 million hectares of Amazon forest were impacted by fires last year alone. This extraordinary surge in fire activity is likely driven by a combination of extreme drought stress exacerbated by climate change, forest fragmentation, and land-use mismanagement (e.g., escape fires or criminal fires by land grabbers), leading to significant forest degradation. For the first time in the analysis covering 2022-2024, fire-induced degradation has overtaken deforestation as the primary driver of carbon emissions in the Amazon.</p><p>This research draws on a sophisticated satellite-based methodology that overcomes many of the limitations of previous global fire datasets. By combining data from the Tropical Moist Forest monitoring system with the Global Wildfire Information System and filtering out false signals caused by agricultural fires or cloud cover, scientists were able to detect and verify fire-driven forest degradation with a novel level of precision.</p><p>The geographical spread of the fires was equally alarming. In Brazil, 2024 marked the highest level of emissions from forest degradation on record. In Bolivia, fires affected over 9% of the country's remaining intact forest cover, which is a dramatic blow to a region that has historically served as a vital biodiversity reservoir and carbon sink.</p><p>To ensure scientific rigor and transparency, the researchers used a Monte Carlo simulation framework to estimate carbon emissions and their uncertainties. across variables such as above-ground biomass density, combustion completeness, and the percentage of forest cover affected by fire. The resulting confidence intervals adhere to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) best practices and offer a robust benchmark for tracking the carbon consequences of forest fires in tropical regions.</p><p>While past reports have highlighted the dangers of deforestation, this study spotlights a more insidious threat: fire-driven degradation that erodes forest integrity without necessarily clearing it. Degraded forests may look intact from above, but they lose a significant portion of their biomass and ecological function. Unlike clear-cut areas, these degraded forests often fall through the cracks of national accounting systems and international policy frameworks.</p><p>The study calls for immediate and coordinated action to reduce fire use, strengthen forest protection policies, and support local and Indigenous stewardship efforts. It also highlights the need for enhanced international climate finance mechanisms that recognize and address forest degradation, not just deforestation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-512281819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXT-RRF3-RVB0-3556-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 9, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001533</classCode><className>SCIENTIFIC METHOD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000854</classCode><className>PLANT CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Instead, the College will host a light and laser show with music performed by student DJs.</p><p>\"By reimagining our tradition, we are respecting community safety and environmental responsibility while creating a new and unforgettable experience for this year's Homecoming weekend,\" Hudak wrote.</p><p>Over the past few months, a severe drought hascoveredlarge swaths of northern New England. Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte issued the ban on Sept. 22, making open fires unlawful until conditions improve.</p><p>This is the first time the bonfire has beencanceledsince 2020, when the state banned public gatherings during the pandemic.</p><p>In an interview with The Dartmouth, Hudak said that while the news may be \"disappointing,\" she expects the opening night of Homecoming to \"still be a celebration of class unity, pride, and creativity.\"</p><p>\"Personally, I'm excited to see our students' talents and creativity at the center of the light and laser show,\" Hudak said.</p><p>Dartmouth's executive director of conferences and events EJ Kiefer said many popular Homecoming traditions will remain.</p><p>\"We wanted as many of the elements of what's in a traditional Homecoming weekend around the Green to be preserved,\" Kiefer said.</p><p>State forest fire supervisor for the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau chief Steven Sherman said the burn ban followed \"the driest summer ever recorded for the state.\"</p><p>\"It was not just the lack of rainfall that contributed to the increased wildfire risk, but also the very low relative humidity levels,\" Sherman said. \"Embers from a large fire such as Dartmouth's could blow off the Green and land on a nearby lawn or wooded area and start a fire that could cause loss of property or injure someone.\"</p><p>Some students expressed disappointment at the College's decision. Gabe Umlas '29 said he was \"pretty devastated\" when he heard the bonfire was canceled.</p><p>\"I was really sad,\" Umlas said. \"I know it's a really fun event that past years have done.\"</p><p>Mackenzie Froedge '29 said she had looked forward to experiencing a class-wide tradition, after many high school traditions were canceled due to COVID.</p><p>\"I was excited to finally have a real tradition in college ... when [the bonfire] was canceled, I thought, 'oh, it's happening all over again,'\" Froedge said.</p><p>Sarah Hochman '28, who experienced last year's bonfire as a freshman, said she understood the environmental concerns but still found the change disappointing.</p><p>\"It's a memory I really treasure,\" Hochman recalled. \"It can be pretty disappointing, especially for the first-years, to know you're not going to be able to share those experiences with other Dartmouth students and alumni.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6216680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GXV-2NH3-RT71-H05J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Dartmouth: Dartmouth College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 9, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Hanover</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

According to news reporting from the Institute of BioEconomy by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Vegetation water content is one of the most important parameters of vegetation status and health, and consequently a natural element that regulates several ecosystems worldwide; moreover, considering vegetation as fuel, this variable is related to wildfires.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Institute of BioEconomy: \"Forest fires and vegetation resistance to ignition during periods of drought are both strictly related to climate characteristics of the area. The contribution of this work is to evaluate the performance of vegetation drought models using field measured data (data related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity), data usually lacking. In the present work, moisture content of shrub vegetation and live foliage (fine fuels) were detected by field measurements of in Tuscany (Italy). In two plots of Quercus ilex L. and mixed broadleaves forest, seasonal and inter-annual variations of live fine fuels of several species are analyzed. The selected species constitute two sets (shrubs and trees) of vegetation typology characterized by a representative seasonal variability in mediterranean ecosystems. From nearby stations meteorological data were collected in each study area for the evaluation of fuel moisture indicators, including the Drought Code (DC) used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The results of the present work have shown that for the summer season the slow response of live fine fuel moisture content (LFMC) to meteorological conditions (namely to precipitation), was well described by the DC. Empirical correlations between LFMC and DC for each species and site are proposed.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Drought models for the study of the vegetation moisture content; analysis of performance of different models in two mediterranean ecosystems for application in forest fire prevention.

A reality that foreshadows a situation not too far away for the summer season in Chile. \"The coming season will be very complex, with high temperatures, heat waves and extreme conditions,\" says Ram\u00f3n Figueroa, Arauco's assistant manager of Fire Protection. In addition, the forestry company explains, the nature of the fires has also changed. Although almost 99% of them in Chile are of human origin, climate change has intensified their behavior. The seasons have become longer and the events more extreme.</p><p><br/>In this context, experts warn of the urgency of facing the crisis with a key strategy that involves collaboration and prevention.<br/>From the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF), Andr\u00e9s Benedetto, manager of Forest Fire Protection, warns that \"the prevention of forest fires in the country must stop being a reactive action and focused on infrastructure, moving from a secondary role to being a structural part of public policies aimed at the environmental, structural and civil protection areas\".<br/>Along these lines, he insists that management cannot wait for a catastrophe to occur. \"Prevention is the only sustainable strategy in the face of increasingly destructive and frequent forest fires. This implies a profound cultural change, a public policy with a long-term vision and the active commitment of all citizens\".<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Companies and communities: strategic allies</emphasis><br/>Despite the role of public sector actors, collaboration with forestry companies and communities is vital, according to experts. Arauco maintains that \"the best fire is the one that never happens. Our focus is to protect forests, rural localities and inhabited areas that have historically been affected.<br/>The company has invested in advanced technology, such as 160 360\u00b0 cameras with artificial intelligence to detect smoke, weather stations, mobile applications for firefighters and a specialized air fleet. But, beyond technology, they highlight community action. \"A key contribution from the private sector is the Community Prevention Network (RPC), made up of almost 500 committees in 94 municipalities, of which Arauco supports 327. These are neighbors organized in interface zones, who together with municipalities, electricity companies and the civil protection system help to maintain safety belts, warn of outbreaks and raise awareness among the population\".<br/>In this context, CONAF emphasizes that \"in all areas, public-private work is essential to advance as a country. Undoubtedly, this takes on an even more transcendental role when it comes to forest fire prevention, mitigation and combat\".<br/>The Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae), which brings together companies, governments, organizations and communities in the protection of forests, provides a concrete vision. Its executive director in Chile, Regina Massai, explains that \"FSC certification helps prevent fires because it obliges forestry companies to take a comprehensive look at the territory before working in it. This means assessing possible impacts, identifying risks together with local communities and establishing concrete control and prevention measures\".<br/>Like Arauco, the director highlighted the example of RPC. This articulation, promoted by FSC-certified companies, has resulted in \"a systematic reduction in fires, which in the last season alone meant a 16% reduction compared to the previous period,\" explains Massai.<br/>\"It is the task of all of us to advance towards a safer and more prepared country in terms of forest fires, including other countries in Latin America and the world, working together towards territorial protection\", concludes CONAF.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72323502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKF-M0M3-RRRY-W4X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Sustentabilidad</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

The hospital indicated that the severity of the burns added to pre-existing conditions that complicated his recovery.<br/>The Portuguese Prime Minister, Lu\u00eds Montenegro, expressed his condolences on his networks and conveyed the gratitude of the whole country to Esteves' family and friends.<br/>President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also mourned the loss. The institutional reaction was evidence of the national concern in the face of an emergency that constantly challenges civil protection teams.<br/>Esteves joins the other fatalities recorded this summer by forest fires in Portugal: former mayor Carlos D\u00e2maso, who died in P\u00eara do Mo\u00e7o on August 15; a firefighter who lost his life in an accident while on his way to the municipality of Fund\u00e3o; and a 75-year-old man who died trying to put out a fire in Mirandela, Bragan\u00e7a.<br/>The accumulation of these deaths makes this summer one of the toughest in the country's recent forestry history.<br/>Portugal requested the activation of the European Civil Protection Mechanism to receive international reinforcements, after the devastation of almost 234,000 hectares of territory as of August 22, according to official data quoted by Europa Press.<br/>The impact of the fires also extends to neighboring Spain, where fatalities and large territorial losses have been recorded, in a context characterized by heat waves and prolonged drought. According to the European Forest Fire Information System, up to this year Portugal has accumulated an affected area of nearly 278,000 hectares, which reflects the unprecedented magnitude of this emergency.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Two arrested for fire in Coimbra</emphasis><br/>The Judicial Police arrested on Saturday two men, 20 and 23 years old, suspected of starting a forest fire on August 18 in the area of Lous\u00e3, near the mountain range of the same name.<br/>The police indicated that the detainees allegedly used a lighter to light a fire in a rural area with dense vegetation, during a day of maximum risk due to high temperatures and low humidity.<br/>The proximity of homes and the presence of abundant dry vegetation increased the destructive potential of the fire, although firefighters managed to act in time and minimize the damage.<br/>The location and arrest of the suspects was possible thanks to the collaboration of the Working Group for the Reduction of Ignitions in Rural Areas of the Literal Center, composed of the Judicial Police, the Republican National Guard and the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests. The detainees will soon be brought to court. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Very violent\" fires in the municipality of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande</emphasis><br/>Tension in the Portuguese territory increased this Saturday by the start of two fires described as \"very violent\" in the municipality of Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande, known for the tragedy of June 2017, when more than 60 people died and hundreds were injured.<br/>The first fire broke out at 14:27 local time in the S\u00e3o Vicente area, mobilizing 247 troops, 57 vehicles and 12 aerial means, given the intensity of the fire and the proximity of inhabited areas. An hour later, another fire broke out in the Gra\u00e7a area, where 105 firefighters, 29 vehicles and a support aircraft were involved.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72335269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKF-KYV3-RWNM-Y072-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 23, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>america</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>mundo</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Taiyuan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, the frequency and severity of large-scale forest fires have increased globally, threatening forest ecosystems, human lives, and property while potentially triggering cascading ecological and social crises.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; State Key Laboratory of Quantum Optics And Quantum Optics Devices; Shanxi Provincial Key Research And Development Project; Central Guided Local Science And Technology Development Funding Program. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from North University of China: \"Despite significant advancements in remote sensing-based forest fire monitoring, early warning systems, and fire risk zoning, post-fire thermal damage assessment remains insufficiently addressed. This study introduces an innovative approach combining multispectral imaging with a dual annealing constrained optimization algorithm to enable dynamic monitoring of fire temperature distribution. Based on this method, we develop a dynamic thermal damage assessment model to quantify thermal impacts during forest fires.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The proposed model provides valuable insights for defining thermal damage zones, optimizing evacuation strategies, and supporting firefighting operations, ultimately enhancing emergency response and forest fire management efficiency.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluation of Thermal Damage Effect of Forest Fire Based on Multispectral Camera Combined with Dual Annealing Algorithm.

According to news originating from Shenzhen, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are a global environmental threat to human life and ecosystems.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Yunnan Provincial Science And Technology Plan Project; Shenzhen Science And Technology Innovation Commission; Key Field Research And Development Program of Guangdong, China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School: \"This study compiles smoke alarm images from five high-definition surveillance cameras in Foshan City, Guangdong, China, collected over one year, to create a smoke-based early warning dataset. The dataset presents two key challenges: (1) high false positive rates caused by pseudo-smoke interference, including non-fire conditions like cooking smoke and industrial emissions, and (2) significant regional data imbalances, influenced by varying human activity intensities and terrain features, which impair the generalizability of traditional pre-train-fine-tune strategies. To address these challenges, we explore the use of visual language models to differentiate between true alarms and false alarms.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Additionally, our method incorporates a prompt tuning strategy which helps to improve performance by at least 12.45% in zero-shot learning tasks and also enhances performance in few-shot learning tasks, demonstrating enhanced regional generalization compared to baselines.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: FireCLIP: Enhancing Forest Fire Detection with Multimodal Prompt Tuning and Vision-Language Understanding.

Around 350,000 hectares were destroyed in just the past two weeks, coinciding with a severe heat wave that began in early August. Martin-Vide emphasized that climate models point to worsening conditions in the coming decades. \"Adaptation is key to reducing the risk,\" he said, noting that temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in central and northern Europe will pose serious challenges to societies less accustomed to extreme heat. He called for stronger prevention measures and better landscape management, highlighting the effects of rural depopulation. \"The woods are not as clean as in the past, when there were cattle, sheep, goats grazing and eating the vegetation that now acts as the fuel that starts a forest fire,\" he explained. The climatologist urged innovative strategies, including the creation of \"mosaic landscapes with forest areas interspersed with cultivated fields,\" to make land more defensible against blazes. He also pointed to adaptation already underway in agriculture, as olive and wine producers move production to higher altitudes, in search of more favorable climatic conditions to maintain both quality and output. Martin-Vide welcomed the Spanish government's plan to establish a nationwide pact on fire prevention, calling it \"very necessary.\" Spain is enduring its worst summer for wildfires this century, with more than 20 major blazes still burning, mainly in the northwestern provinces of Orense, Zamora and Leon. The interior ministry said over 33,000 people have been evacuated, while four people, including three firefighters, have died.

They are already restoring more than 500 000 hectares an area nearly five times the size of Rome, where FAO is marking its 80th anniversary this week. By the end of the decade, the initiatives expect to have under restoration almost 500,000 additional hectares of forests, mountains, farmlands, grasslands, shrublands and savannahs, as well as coastal and freshwater ecosystems.</p><p>\"These flagships show what is doable when people come together to reverse the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and waste,\" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. \"As a fierce thunderstorm can end with birdsong, degraded ecosystems can be revived. At scale, these efforts deliver multiple benefits, including food security and livelihoods.\"</p><p>Collaborative Rangelands Restoration Jordan</p><p>Tel al-Rumman, north of Amman, is an open mountainous forest area, which had been severely degraded due to illegal overgrazing. When Jordan set out to establish its first botanic garden, instead of unclaimed forest land, ecologists met 4 500 sheep and the communities tending to them.</p><p>What could have led to conflict resulted in partnership instead. The Royal Botanic Gardens is now working together with traditional herders on reviving sustainable practices, and 180 hectares are being restored to showcase all of Jordan's unique plants and ecosystems. Biomass production is already growing more than eight-fold, benefiting local herders. Communities can now make use of seven times more grazing days, lower feed costs, and income that more than doubled. The number of herding families has also grown more than 10 times over.</p><p>The program's participatory model demonstrates that restoring biodiversity can strengthen food production and community trust, using both scientific methods and traditional knowledge on range practices, livestock management and ecological restoration.</p><p>Revitalizing Korea's Forests after Fire Republic of Korea</p><p>The Uljin forest fire will be remembered as one of the Republic of Korea's worst ecological disasters, burning through over 20 000 hectares in about ten days.</p><p>This World Restoration Flagship in Uljin-gun is restoring the country's valuable forests while prioritising community livelihoods and post-fire resilience. This includes reviving native plant species such as the endangered spike rosebay and the habitat of the long-tailed goral, a small goat-like mammal. The entire fire-damaged area is expected to be restored by 2030.</p><p>The Republic of Korea took a unique approach to post-fire restoration, focused on bringing back biodiversity over economically viable tree species, and involving communities along the way. The country is home to one of only two major doomsday seed vaults worldwide. Complementing the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, which focuses on crop species, the Republic of Korea's Baekdudaegan vault at the Native Plant Seed Supply Center was established in 2023 in response to the forest fire. It saves and researches wild tree and plant seeds, supporting efforts to bounce back from fires.</p><p>The Restoration Initiative working across Africa and Asia</p><p>This initiative brings together nine countries: Cameroon, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Pakistan, Sao Tome and Principe, and Tanzania. Supported since 2018 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), FAO, UNEP and the Global Environment Fund (GEF), this initiative aims to overcome barriers to large-scale restoration, sharing know-how on improving awareness, monitoring, supporting businesses, and drawing investments.</p><p>The initiative has brought to date over 310 000 hectares under restoration and 717 000 under improved management practices, and it plans to bring under restoration over 160 000 additional hectares by 2030. To date, over 420 000 people have directly benefited from the programme, while mitigating over 30 million tonnes of COa,, equivalent equivalent to emissions from eight coal-fired power plants in one year.</p><p>The Restoration Initiative is designed to translate global restoration goals to local contexts for example by boosting local restoration economies, such as nurseries, training smallholder farmers and pastoralists, removing invasive species and informing government policies.</p><p>Bamboo-based restoration multiple countries</p><p>Across nine countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, bamboo is being harnessed as a fast-growing, sustainable plant for land restoration, reversing the impacts of intense agriculture, logging, demand for fuelwood and charcoal and climate change.</p><p>Bamboo-based restoration supports poverty reduction, creating livelihoods, carbon storage, land degradation and biodiversity loss, including iconic bamboo lemurs, gorillas and the giant panda.</p><p>The initiative, led by the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR), has already restored about 200 000 hectares and benefited a similar number of people from improved livelihoods and incomes. By 2030, the initiative aims to attract investments to restore an additional 300 000 hectares. This is being achieved through knowledge development and capacity building of governments and local communities. Key enabling factors for this initiative include the harmonization of policies, the participation of multiple sectors in the economy, respecting Indigenous People's rights and cultural considerations, and scientifically choosing appropriate bamboo species out of 1 600 existing species and building appropriate value-chains.</p><p>NOTES TO EDITORS</p><p>About the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration</p><p>The UN General Assembly has declared 20212030 aUN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Led by the UN Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, together with the support of partners, it is designed to prevent, halt, and reverse the loss and degradation of ecosystems worldwide. It aims at reviving billions of hectares, covering terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. A global call to action, the UN Decade draws together political support, scientific research, and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration.</p><p>About the UN World Restoration Flagships</p><p>Countries have already promised to restore1 billion hectares roughly the size of China as part of their commitments to theParis climate agreement, theAichi targetsfor biodiversity, theLand Degradation Neutralitytargets and theBonn Challenge. However, little is known about the progress or quality of this restoration. With the World Restoration Flagships, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is honouring the best examples of large-scale and long-term ecosystem restoration in any country or region, embodying the 10 Restoration Principles of the UN Decade.Progress of all World Restoration Flagships will be transparently monitored through the Framework for Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring, the UN Decade's platform for keeping track of global restoration efforts.</p><p>About the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) UNEPis the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.</p><p>About the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</p><p>FAOis a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. It aims to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active healthy lives. With over 194 Members, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127391689</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H04-CSB3-RWN5-C1CY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 14, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The results show that the symptoms most reported by the population exposed to smoke were respiratory (difficulty breathing in 71.4% of cases), followed by irritation in mucous membranes (77.1%), throat (80.0%), and eyes (85.7%). Although no significant differences were observed in all conditions, Los Ciros had a higher prevalence of symptoms, suggesting that poorer baseline health status could aggravate the effects of smoke. The most frequent mitigation measures were the use of masks (63.6%), staying indoors (54.5%), and the use of wet cloths (21.2%), without finding a significant association between these strategies and the reduction of symptoms.<br/> \u201cThis study highlights the need to improve air pollution protection strategies in communities affected by wildfires and develop prevention policies to mitigate their effects on public health.\u201d<br/> This preprint has not been peer-reviewed.<br/> For more information on this research see: medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.06.25327500v1<br/> Keywords for this news article include: Air Pollution, Epidemiology, Public and Global Health. <br/> Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.

These designations honour the diversity of history in Canada. These include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Places:Seven Oaks House in Winnipeg, Manitoba</p><p>Persons: William Kennedy, Charlotte Edith Anderson Monture, Mary Two-Axe Earley, Everett Baker</p><p>Events: RCMP Musical Ride, Invention of the Morris Rod-Weeder, Rural Electrification Across Canada, Klippert Case, 1967, Miramichi Fire of 1825, First World War Training at Sarcee Camp</p><p>Some highlights from today's announcement include:</p><p>Rural Electrification Across Canada: In the early 20th century, most Canadians lived in rural areas without electricity. Advocacy from women's and farmers' groups helped drive a national push for rural electrification, promoted heavily by utility companies as a modern necessity. Each province took a different approachfrom Ontario's publicly owned system to Alberta's cooperatives and Saskatchewan's rapid expansion with farmers. While electrification reshaped rural Canada, some rural residents resisted change, and many First Nations were left out. By the 1970s, nearly all rural households across Canada were connected to central power stations, dramatically improving quality of life and enabling new technologies.</p><p>Mary Two-Axe Earley: This Kanien'keha:ka (Mohawk) woman was a trailblazer in the fight for equality for First Nations women. She brought national attention to the gender discrimination in the Indian Act, which stripped women of their Indian status if they married non-status men. Her advocacy led to changes in the law in 1985, allowing women to retain and pass on their status to their children. Two-Axe Earley was the first person to have her status reinstated under the amended Indian Act.</p><p>RCMP Musical Ride: With origins in British cavalry traditions, this grand precision performance of scarlet-uniformed police constables on horseback, coordinated with music, was first performed in Regina, North-West Territories (now Saskatchewan), in 1887. The Musical Ride demonstrates the longstanding importance of horsemanship in the history of the federal police force. In 1961, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police created an annual Ride, performing more than one hundred times per year by 1966. Since 1988, officers selected for the Ride serve a three-year term before returning to regular police duties. The Ride now tours across Canada and around the world from May to October.</p><p>Miramichi Fire: In October 1825, the Miramichi Fire burned an estimated 15,500 km2 in northeastern New Brunswick, devastating communities, killing hundreds of people, and leaving thousands more homeless. Roughly 50,000 was raised to help the entire colony, and this is thought to have been the largest disaster relief effort in pre-Confederation Canadian history. The relief effort strengthened ties between the colony of New Brunswick and Great Britain, the United States, and the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada. This massive forest fire had extensive environmental impacts in New Brunswick, and lasting changes to the ecosystem had an impact on settlers and Mi'kmaq whose lives and livelihoods depended on the lands and waters of the Miramichi region. In the aftermath of the fire, timber exploitation moved to new frontiers while the Miramichi region's industry shifted to the processed lumber trade.</p><p>First World War Training at Sarcee Camp: In 1915, reflecting Canada's commitment to the First World War, the government established Sarcee Camp near Calgary on lands recently surrendered by the Tsuut'ina (Sarcee) First Nation. As one of Canada's largest training camps, it introduced over 45,000 Canadians to military life before they were sent overseas. Stone markers on Signal Hill commemorate the thousands who trained there. The camp's creation highlights the pressures faced by First Nations when lands promised for their exclusive use were repurposed for military needs, sparking ongoing conflict. For the Tsuut'ina Nation, the extensive military use of these lands in the 20th century remains a significant legacy. Sarcee Camp's continued use during the Second World War and the Cold War underscores its lasting role in Canada's military history.</p><p>The Government of Canada, through the recommendations from the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and Parks Canada, recognizes significant persons, places, and events that have shaped our country as one way of helping Canadians connect with their past. By sharing these stories with Canadians, we hope to foster understanding and reflection on the diverse histories, cultures, legacies, and realities of Canada's past and present.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127405428</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H1V-54N3-S10X-P1F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 22, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is established in the latest Annual Report of the State Attorney General's Office, which has put the number of people who were arrested or investigated for fire-related incidents at 306.</p><p><br/>If we compare this with the total number of people arrested and investigated so far this summer for these causes, 169 (42 arrested and 127 investigated) according to the data of the Ministry of the Interior updated on August 22, the number is much lower than in 2024. On the other hand, most of the accidents for which police interventions took place, according to this report, were not of intentional origin.<br/>On the contrary, according to the data provided monthly by the different police forces to the Prosecutor of the Environmental and Urban Planning Coordinating Chamber of the State Attorney General's Office, most of them were caused by negligence or accidents: More than 50.98% of the fires were caused by this cause compared to 24.18% that were indeed arson, a trend that is maintained in the previous four years. In 2023, 68% of the fires were accidental and 24.18% were arson, while in 2022, 63.50% were accidents and 25.50% were caused voluntarily.<br/>The Public Prosecutor's Office establishes five types of casuistry attributable to the origin of these fires. The so-called \"natural\" ones, that is to say, not linked in any case to human action, those originated by negligence or accidents (those caused involuntarily by human activity due to carelessness, imprudence or fortuitous situations) or of intentional origin, whose purpose is to produce the forest fire. They can also be caused by \"reproductions\", that is, when the fire is originated from a previous fire. Finally, we would find all those fires that have not been investigated or where the investigation has not been resolved.<br/>Another revealing fact of the report is that the number of large forest fires (GIF), i.e., all those exceeding 500 ha, was very small compared to small or intermediate sized fires.<br/>Those fires in which police intervention was carried out were 37.5% of the fires that were started and a majority, 61.81%, were fires of between 1 ha and 500 ha. A minimal percentage of these fires corresponded to GIF, only 0.69%.<br/>In other words, the change observed between previous years and this one is the significant increase in the virulence of the fires, which are spreading more and more rapidly and are devastating a larger area. This 2025, more than 411,315 hectares have burned in the worst wave of fires recorded in Spain this century, according to the latest update of the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).<br/>This figure is almost 10 times that of 2024. The area burned by fire in 2025 far exceeds the 42,615 hectares burned in 2024, with 219 fires, with an increase in Large Forest Fires (LFF).  All this is due, according to experts, not only to the acceleration of the climate crisis, but also to factors such as rural abandonment and different changes in land use, which contribute to the spread of fire.<br/>In relation to previous years, highlights the report of the Prosecutor's Office, the GIFs decreased with respect to the average of the last five years, figures that were at 22 GIFs, being able to highlight a variation of -22.7% in large forest fires.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72786171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GNS-2D53-RRPK-93HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 5, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Medio Ambiente</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DZIO</classCode><className>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D4JV</classCode><className>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

Since its inception, the unit has planted more than 6.076 million saplings, covering 5,675 hectares across the state. It has also developed 11 nurseries with a combined capacity of 430,000 plants, while rejuvenating three Amrit Sarovars and several ponds.</p><p><br/><br/>Over the past 19 years, the force has made remarkable strides not only in afforestation but also in soil conservation, disaster management, and protection of natural resources. According to Col. Deepak Kumar, Commanding Officer of the 133 Eco Task Force, the unit operates on a unique model that engages ex-servicemen. Re-inducted into service as part of a small Army Corps Group, they are entrusted with crucial environmental responsibilities.<br/><br/>In the last five years alone, the Eco Task Force has successfully controlled 43 forest fire incidents and enhanced fire prevention through fire lines in 42 project areas. To further aid water conservation, it has built 11 check dams using locally available materials.<br/><br/>The unit organises special plantation drives during significant events such as Van Mahotsav, Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam, Meri Maati Mera Desh, Swachhata Hi Seva and International Yoga Day. Alongside plantation, its ongoing efforts include safeguarding flora and fauna, preserving water resources and promoting soil stability.<br/><br/>Beyond conservation, the Eco Task Force has also provided shelter, food, and transport to people affected by natural disasters\u2014strengthening its dual commitment to environmental protection and humanitarian service.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMED-M676381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMED2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRP-KSS3-RTCX-X3F9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428672</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"276\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Indian Media News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Media news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6622\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 15, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS59</classCode><className>SOIL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSJF</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS44</classCode><className>WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

It has not been another summer of fires in Spain, but the worst of the century, according to EFFIS (European Forest Fire Information System) satellite predictions of all fires of 30 hectares or more. The first estimates exceeded 400,000 hectares, while this week's figures are somewhat lower. Although the methodology differs from the Forest Fire Statistics (EGIF), the one consolidated from the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, the dimensions of these fires have already left a fatal record in history.</p><p><br/>Taking only the EFFIS data, this statistical footprint leaves the previous numbers far behind. The 62 large fires (those with more than 500 ha) are only two fewer than the entire year 2022, but six of them have exceeded 20,000 ha. In 2022 and 2021, the only years of the decade with fires of such size, do not reach such a count.<br/>If these figures are already surprising at the national level, how much more so for the regions where these fires have raged. In Ourense some 140,000 hectares have been burned and in Le\u00f3n some 70,000, followed by 47,000 in Zamora and 38,000 in C\u00e1ceres, according to the latest data under review. The area burned in Le\u00f3n and Ourense is, in fact, more than half of the area burned in the last decade (and a quarter in Zamora and C\u00e1ceres). Only the lands of Zamora experienced a worse episode in 2022 with the fires in the Sierra de la Culebra.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Fires with their own name </emphasis><br/>A R\u00faa, U\u00f1a, Chandrexa... There have been so many mega-fires in 2025 that there are many names engraved in the memory of the areas they affected. These fires alone have broken the ceiling of the statistics, without the need to add them up to show the contrast with previous years. Pending uniform data from the Ministry, for the moment they exceed the worst EGIF losses.<br/>The most devastating fires occurred from August 8 to 13. They have made this period the worst since records have been kept, if we take as a reference the total area destroyed by these fires on their day of origin. Thus, the moving average of the weekly hectares at four weeks (almost the equivalent of a month) reveals a much more damaged Spain in this August than in previous EFFIS August.<br/>Again, one must take into account the lag of the EGIF figures, which in principle places its worst peaks well below the 2025 record. But 2025 also ranks well above the peaks of the EFFIS statistical series, such as 2022, the next most prominent year in these satellite records. To put this in context, the A R\u00faa fire in 2025 is equivalent to the total burned area given by EFFIS for all of 2024.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72657817</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GN4-5DF3-S547-K02P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 2, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Sociedad</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC325</classCode><className>SPAIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news originating from Uttarakhand, India, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"We present a study that addresses the critical need for a prototype Decision Support System for forest fire information and management in Uttarakhand, India.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Forest Research Institute: \"The study's main objective was to carry out statistical analysis of large fire incident datasets to understand trends of fires in the region and develop essential spatial decision support tools. These tools address the necessary fire management decision-making along with comprehensive datasets that can enable a decision maker to exercise better management. Moreover, this DSS addresses three major components of forest fire decision support: (i) pre-fire (forest information visualization) tools, (ii) during-fire terrain-based spatial decision support tools, and (iii) post-fire restoration tools. The efforts to develop this DSS included satellite lidar dataset-based fuel load estimations, the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, and the integration of spatial tools that ensure better spatial decisions in fire suppression planning. In addition, based on the bibliographic literature, the study also uses ecological and community-based knowledge, including financial aspects, for fire prevention and post-fire restoration planning. The development of this DSS involves an open-source R Shiny framework, enabling any decision maker at the execution or planning level to access these key datasets and simulate the spatial solutions cost-effectively.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Hence, this study aimed to internalize key decision support tools and datasets based on extensive statistical analysis for data-driven forest fire planning and management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Prototype Forest Fire Decision Support System for Uttarakhand, India.

According to news originating from Xiangtan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenges of complex terrain, dynamic wind fields, and multi-objective constraints in multi-UAV collaborative path planning for forest firefighting missions.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Xiangtan University: \"An extensible algorithm, termed Parallel Vectorized Differential Evolution-based Multi-Objective Jellyfish Search (PVDE-MOJS), is proposed to enhance path planning performance. A comprehensive multi-objective cost function is formulated, incorporating path length, threat avoidance, altitude constraints, path smoothness, and wind effects. Forest-specific constraints are modeled using cylindrical threat zones and segmented wind fields. The conventional jellyfish search algorithm is then enhanced through multi-core parallel fitness evaluation, vectorized non-dominated sorting, and differential evolution-based mutation. These improvements substantially boost convergence efficiency and solution quality in high-dimensional optimization scenarios. Simulation results on the Phillip Archipelago Forest Farm digital elevation model (DEM) in Australia demonstrate that PVDE-MOJS outperforms the original MOJS algorithm in terms of inverted generational distance (IGD) across benchmark functions UF1-UF10.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The proposed method achieves effective obstacle avoidance, altitude optimization, and wind adaptation, producing uniformly distributed Pareto fronts. This work offers a viable solution for emergency UAV path planning in forest fire rescue scenarios, with future extensions aimed at dynamic environments and large-scale UAV swarms.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: UAV Path Planning for Forest Firefighting Using Optimized Multi-Objective Jellyfish Search Algorithm.

The new proposal would allow the state to increase the surcharge, not to exceed $100 for each improved lot or parcel to offset the cost of fire preparedness.</p><p>Haagenson told Little and the Land Board that the current $40 annual surcharge is not enough to support the state's fire protection program, particularly as Idaho continues to grow and more homes are built in areas where human development and forest lands meet. </p><p>#8216;The proposal is to change the improved particle surcharge from $40 to up to $100 and that change is needed to ensure funding for the future of healthy wildfire protection,#8217; Haggenson said.</p><p>About 67,000 parcels of land in forests in Idaho are subject to the surcharge, Haagenson said. If the state raised the surcharge to $100, that would generate about $4 million more per year in funding for wildfires, state officials said. </p><p>Little and Land Board members voted to approve the proposal, with the potential for Idaho Department of Lands officials to make further revisions or withdraw it entirely. That means the department can move forward with the proposal but may change it or decide not to bring it forward.</p><p>For the change to take effect, the proposal would need to be introduced as a bill during an upcoming session of the Idaho Legislature, receive a majority of votes in both the Idaho Senate and Idaho House of Representatives and be signed into law by the governor. </p><p>The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to begin Jan. 12 in Boise.</p><p>YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.</p><p> SUPPORT </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000985401K0A4M0SJ7KKN2CQRACVPQF65</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8R-76P3-RRV5-01ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567747</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"In recent years, the increasingly significant impacts of climate change and human activities on the environment have led to more frequent occurrences of extreme events such as forest fires. The recurrent wildfires pose severe threats to ecological environments and human life safety.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key R&amp;D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University, \"Consequently, forest fire prediction has become a current research hotspot, where accurate forecasting technologies are crucial for reducing ecological and economic losses, improving forest fire management efficiency, and ensuring personnel safety and property security. To enhance comprehensive understanding of wildfire prediction research, this paper systematically reviews studies since 2015, focusing on two key aspects: datasets with related tools and prediction algorithms. We categorized the literature into three categories: statistical analysis and physical models, traditional machine learning methods, and deep learning approaches. Additionally, this review summarizes the data types and open-source datasets used in the selected literature. The paper further outlines current challenges and future directions, including exploring wildfire risk data management and multimodal deep learning, investigating self-supervised learning models, improving model interpretability and developing explainable models, integrating physics-informed models with machine learning, and constructing digital twin technology for real-time wildfire simulation and fire scenario analysis.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study aims to provide valuable support for forest natural resource management and enhanced environmental protection through the application of remote sensing technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Advancements In Artificial Intelligence Applications for Forest Fire Prediction.

According to the National Forestry and Wildlife Service (SERFOR), 15 of them are categorized as vulnerable and eight are endemic to the region, such as the cahuato (Tecoma arequipensis).</p><p><br/>Regarding the fauna, Luis Felipe Gonz\u00e1les Due\u00f1as, Technical Forestry and Wildlife Administrator in Arequipa, indicated that the exact number of species affected has not yet been determined, but traces of Andean foxes, partridges, lizards, and wild guinea pig shelters have been identified, in addition to birds whose nests were consumed by the fire.<br/>Fortunately, no injured specimens have been found during the intervention, but the loss of habitat seriously compromises the survival of these species in the area.<br/>The official explained that the recovery of the area will depend on rainfall, as the ecosystem is adapted to long periods of drought. \"If permanent rainfall is recorded, regeneration could take between three and four years. The grasslands will grow first, but the shrub species will take longer to recover,\" he said.<br/>Gonz\u00e1les Due\u00f1as warned that the fire is suspected to have been caused by alleged invaders who were marking out land in the area. For this reason, the agency announced that it will initiate investigations and apply administrative sanctions against those responsible, which could be up to 10 UITs.<br/>For the moment, SERFOR has not yet specified the exact extent of the hectares consumed, as the official estimate is made after analyzing the \"fire scar\" using satellite images and technical reports.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73150436</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GRW-S873-RXN7-S22N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 15, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC353</classCode><className>PERU</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news originating from Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fire is becoming an important research topic because of climate change and its impact on population. In this study, historical database about forest fire incidents was created for Gironde and Les Landes (1989 to 2022).\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from United Arab Emirates University: \"To the knowledge of the authors, this database did not exist before. The database is essential in showing spatial and temporal distribution of forest fires and helps in decision-making. The database was created from newspapers and crosschecked with burned areas visible on Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite images. Several factors were used to generate a forest fire hazard map such as vegetation water content utilizing Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), type of vegetation, topography, and barriers to the expansion of fire (proximity to water bodies and roads). All layers were converted to raster format and reclassified to a common scale. Weighted overlay in GIS was used to generate the final forest fire hazard map. Results showed that, temporally most forest fires occurred during March-April and July-August and majority are in Gironde. The hazard map highlights that most of Les Landes and Gironde departments are vulnerable to this hazard because of their extended forest areas and high dryness. The accuracy assessment showed that supervised classification had the best accuracy followed by the Burned Area Detection Index (BADI) and the manual digitization.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Data from French institutions and higher-resolution satellite images could improve the accuracy of the historical forest fires database. The output from the study was made available to the public for further exploration ( https://firemap.saro.app/ ).\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Documentation of Historical Forest Fires and Hazard: Case of Gironde and Les Landes, France.

Additionally, 25 fire trucks/brush trucks, 25 fire engines from local departments are assisting with the firefight, the NJFFS chief said. </p><p>The fire was first reported by a private aircraft flying over the area around 5 a.m. Friday. Officials said the dry, sandy soil has fueled the flames.</p><p>\"The main challenge is we're in a very remote area, Wharton State Forest, so limited access,\" NJFFS assistant firewarden David Achey said. \"No cellphone service communications have been a little bit of an issue, but we're working on straightening that kind of stuff out. So, just the remoteness of the location and the fuels we're dealing with. This is the heart of the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, so very violate fuels.\"</p><p>Local forest roads, as well as Tuckerton Road from Carranza Road to Washington Turnpike, Carranza Road from Forked Neck Road to Tuckerton Road, Bulldozer and Hampton roads, are closed as firefighters continue to battle the wildfire. The Batona Trail is also closed between Carranza and Quaker Bridge roads.</p><p>The Lower Forge Campground and Phillip M. Costello Preparatory Academy were evacuated on Friday as a precaution, according to the NJFFS. Donnelly previously said around 23 students were evacuated from the school, but officials anticipate they'll be allowed back in as soon as possible.</p><p>Five homes near the fire were told to shelter in place, Donnelly said. No injuries have been reported at this time.</p><p>However, Brittney Poulysyn, who lives down the street on Carranza Road, said she's been keeping tabs on the fire.</p><p>\"I saw smoke down this way, down Forked Neck Road, I saw smoke,\" she said while pointing down the road. \"I keep track of it on the PulsePoint app, and we have the local Facebook group pages.\"</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p>Jessica MacAulay and Nate Sylves contributed to this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

To fill this gap, researchers from the countries of the Amazon basin are carrying out an unprecedented study focused on the benefits related to the territories occupied by indigenous peoples.</p><p><br/>This research, funded by the Ford Foundation, brought together researchers from eight countries in the Amazon basin, with Brazil playing a leading role, as it holds the largest portion of the forest (around 60% of the total). The study also includes information from Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, French Guiana, Venezuela, Suriname and Ecuador - the only country missing was Guyana.<br/>The work was published on Thursday (11) in the scientific journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, from the Nature group.<br/>\"The focus was initially only on the Brazilian Amazon and fire-related diseases. And then we extended it to a second phase to understand if the effects were maintained when we looked at the entire biome and other aspects of human health,\" Paula Priest, a biologist and researcher at the International Organization for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), told Folha.<br/>According to the study, fires in tropical and subtropical regions are responsible for 90% of global emissions of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers), degrading air quality and affecting the respiratory health of the population.<br/>The researchers arrived at a total of 28,429,422 cases of 21 forest fire-related, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, with an incidence rate of 556.96 per 100,000 people, reported in the countries of the Amazon basin from 2001 to 2019.<br/>Forest fire-related diseases accounted for 80.3% (22,821,426 cases), with respiratory diseases being the most prevalent (79.4%), while cardiovascular diseases accounted for 0.87%.<br/>Zoonotic/vector-borne diseases accounted for 19.7% (5,607,996 cases), with malaria accounting for 92.62% of these. Venezuela, Suriname and Peru had the highest incidences. Others such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (5.57%), Chagas disease (1.60%) and visceral leishmaniasis (0.12%) were less common.<br/>\"This is very clear evidence of the role of indigenous territories, as well as other forest areas. The sustainable management of traditional peoples manages to provide this service that benefits the health of populations that are not necessarily close to these territories,\" says Priest.<br/>From 2001 to 2019, the Amazon lost 532,571 km\u00b2 to fires, with an annual average of 28,030 km\u00b2, according to the study. Brazil had the largest total area burned (372,281 km\u00b2), followed by Bolivia (121,189 km\u00b2) and Colombia (21,956 km\u00b2).<br/>Proportionally, Bolivia had the greatest extent of burning, with almost 16% of its Amazon area affected, followed by Brazil (8.6%) and Colombia (4%). The accumulated burned area, including repeated fires, reached 923,784 km\u00b2, with almost 30% of the Bolivian Amazon and 15% of the Brazilian.<br/>The highest number of fires occurred in 2010 and, on average, the areas burned 18 times, indicating recurrent fire. Most of the fires (88.7%) occurred outside the TIs, with 11.3% inside, 7.5% in recognized areas and 3.7% in unrecognized territories.<br/>\"We were interested in understanding the effects of indigenous lands because these are areas that are often not prioritized when it comes to conservation, in the eyes of non-technical people,\" continued Priest.<br/>\"I had already seen studies showing that these areas under indigenous protection manage to store a high amount of carbon, important for climate mitigation, and conserve more biodiversity than other protected lands. So we wondered if it was the same for human health.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heat-related deaths</emphasis><br/>Another recent study, this one published in Nature Climate Change, evaluated the impact of tropical forest deforestation on human health, involving the Americas, Africa and Asia.<br/>The results indicate a direct link between forest loss, rising local temperatures and increased mortality, with around 28,000 deaths a year - most of which could be avoided, the survey points out.<br/>From 2001 to 2020, around 345 million people were exposed to local warming, with an average increase of 0.27?\u00b0C in surface temperature, according to the study led by the University of Leeds (England), in partnership with Fiocruz (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) and Kwame Nkrumah University (Ghana).<br/>The consequences are most severe in Southeast Asia, with 8 to 11 deaths per 100,000 exposed inhabitants.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73012471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GR1-WSH3-RRSM-611D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 11, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>cotidiano</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Sun Yat-sen University by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are severe ecological disasters worldwide that cause extensive ecological destruction and economic losses while threatening biodiversity and human safety. With the escalation of climate change, the frequency and intensity of forest fires are increasing annually, underscoring the urgent need for effective monitoring and early warning systems.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key Research And Development Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangdong Key Areas Research And Development Project. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Sun Yat-sen University: \"This study investigates the application effectiveness of deep learning-based object detection technology in forest fire smoke recognition by using the YOLOv11x algorithm to develop an efficient fire detection model. The objective is to enhance early fire detection capabilities and mitigate potential damage. To improve the model's applicability and generalizability, two publicly available fire image datasets, WD (Wildfire Dataset) and FFS (Forest Fire Smoke), encompassing various complex scenarios and external conditions, were employed. After 501 training epochs, the model's detection performance was comprehensively evaluated via multiple metrics, including precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP50 and mAP50-95). The results demonstrate that YOLOv11x excels in bounding box loss (box loss), classification loss (cls loss), and distribution focal loss (dfl loss), indicating effective optimization of object detection performance across multiple dimensions. Specifically, the model achieved a precision of 0.949, a recall of 0.850, an mAP50 of 0.901, and an mAP50-95 of 0.786, highlighting its high detection accuracy and stability. Analysis of the precision-recall (PR) curve revealed an average mAP@0.5 of 0.901, further confirming the effectiveness of YOLOv11x in fire smoke detection. Notably, the mAP@0.5 for the smoke category reached 0.962, whereas for the flame category, it was 0.841, indicating superior performance in smoke detection compared with flame detection. This disparity primarily arises from the distinct visual characteristics of flames and smoke; flames possess more vivid colors and defined shapes, facilitating easier recognition by the model, whereas smoke exhibits more ambiguous and variable textures and shapes, increasing detection difficulty.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In the test set, 86.89% of the samples had confidence scores exceeding 0.85, further validating the model's reliability. In summary, the YOLOv11x algorithm demonstrates excellent performance and broad application potential in forest fire smoke recognition, providing robust technical support for early fire warning systems and offering valuable insights for the design of intelligent monitoring systems in related fields.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Research and application of deep learning object detection methods for forest fire smoke recognition.

These designations honour the diversity of history in Canada. These include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Places :Seven Oaks House in Winnipeg, Manitoba</p><p>Persons: William Kennedy, Charlotte Edith Anderson Monture, Mary Two-Axe Earley, Everett Baker</p><p>Events : RCMP Musical Ride, Invention of the Morris Rod-Weeder, Rural Electrification Across Canada, Klippert Case, 1967, Miramichi Fire of 1825, First World War Training at Sarcee Camp</p><p>Some highlights from today's announcement include:</p><p>Rural Electrification Across Canada: In the early 20 th century, most Canadians lived in rural areas without electricity. Advocacy from women's and farmers' groups helped drive a national push for rural electrification, promoted heavily by utility companies as a modern necessity. Each province took a different approach--from Ontario's publicly owned system to Alberta's cooperatives and Saskatchewan's rapid expansion with farmers. While electrification reshaped rural Canada, some rural residents resisted change, and many First Nations were left out. By the 1970s, nearly all rural households across Canada were connected to central power stations, dramatically improving quality of life and enabling new technologies.</p><p>Mary Two-Axe Earley : This Kanien'keha:ka (Mohawk) woman was a trailblazer in the fight for equality for First Nations women. She brought national attention to the gender discrimination in the Indian Act, which stripped women of their Indian status if they married non-status men. Her advocacy led to changes in the law in 1985, allowing women to retain and pass on their status to their children. Two-Axe Earley was the first person to have her status reinstated under the amended Indian Act.</p><p>RCMP Musical Ride : With origins in British cavalry traditions, this grand precision performance of scarlet-uniformed police constables on horseback, coordinated with music, was first performed in Regina, North-West Territories (now Saskatchewan), in 1887. The Musical Ride demonstrates the longstanding importance of horsemanship in the history of the federal police force. In 1961, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police created an annual Ride, performing more than one hundred times per year by 1966. Since 1988, officers selected for the Ride serve a three-year term before returning to regular police duties. The Ride now tours across Canada and around the world from May to October.</p><p>Miramichi Fire : In October 1825, the Miramichi Fire burned an estimated 15,500 km 2 in northeastern New Brunswick, devastating communities, killing hundreds of people, and leaving thousands more homeless. Roughly PS50,000 was raised to help the entire colony, and this is thought to have been the largest disaster relief effort in pre-Confederation Canadian history. The relief effort strengthened ties between the colony of New Brunswick and Great Britain, the United States, and the colonies of Upper and Lower Canada. This massive forest fire had extensive environmental impacts in New Brunswick, and lasting changes to the ecosystem had an impact on settlers and Mi'kmaq whose lives and livelihoods depended on the lands and waters of the Miramichi region. In the aftermath of the fire, timber exploitation moved to new frontiers while the Miramichi region's industry shifted to the processed lumber trade.</p><p>First World War Training at Sarcee Camp: In 1915, reflecting Canada's commitment to the First World War, the government established Sarcee Camp near Calgary on lands recently surrendered by the Tsuut'ina (Sarcee) First Nation. As one of Canada's largest training camps, it introduced over 45,000 Canadians to military life before they were sent overseas. Stone markers on Signal Hill commemorate the thousands who trained there. The camp's creation highlights the pressures faced by First Nations when lands promised for their exclusive use were repurposed for military needs, sparking ongoing conflict. For the Tsuut'ina Nation, the extensive military use of these lands in the 20 th century remains a significant legacy. Sarcee Camp's continued use during the Second World War and the Cold War underscores its lasting role in Canada's military history.</p><p>The Government of Canada, through the recommendations from the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and Parks Canada, recognizes significant persons, places, and events that have shaped our country as one way of helping Canadians connect with their past. By sharing these stories with Canadians, we hope to foster understanding and reflection on the diverse histories, cultures, legacies, and realities of Canada's past and present.</p><p>-30-</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/parks-canada/news/2025/10/government-of-canada-recognizes-11-new-designations-of-national-historic-significance.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/parks-canada/news/2025/10/government-of-canada-recognizes-11-new-designations-of-national-historic-significance.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9413330 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9413330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6H1R-C1S3-RT19-M1T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>October 22, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
