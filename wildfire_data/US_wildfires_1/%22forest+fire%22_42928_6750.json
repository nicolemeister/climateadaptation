But new research that ties together multiple aspects of political violence reveals universal dynamics in how conflicts emerge and expand. The work provides a statistical framework that could one day help anticipate deadly violence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cornell researchers analyzed more than 100,000 reports of armed conflict in Africa, compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project over 20 years. They studied various forms of armed conflict, from battles between nation-states and violence against civilians to riots and protests, in search of common themes in seemingly complex phenomena.</p><p>\"Surprisingly, we found a universal pattern for how conflicts grow. Armed conflicts tend to follow remarkably simple statistical models,\" said Eddie Lee, M.S. '18, Ph.D. '19, and lead author on the research. \"People tend to think of conflict as very regional and context specific. We found emergent patterns that align with physical dimensions of space and time in a unified and predictable way.\"</p><p>The paper, \"A Scaling Theory for Armed Conflict Avalanches,\" was published Oct. 28 in Physical Review E. Christopher Myers, M.S. '88, Ph.D. '91, adjunct professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a co-author.</p><p>The researchers clustered together conflicts that occurred in close proximity and within a specific time frame. These clusters, called \"conflict avalanches,\" followed statistically relevant relationships between a few key variables: fatalities, duration, geographic spread and incident reports recorded in the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project (ACLED).</p><p>The datasets from ACLED, which tracks political violence and protests across the world, provide a granular look into deadly violence. The Cornell researchers found that conflicts of various scales in Africa followed consistent patterns such as power law scaling, in which a change in one quantity is related to a proportional change in another.</p><p>Conflicts are notoriously difficult to measure, especially their fatalities. The research reveals how some characteristics of armed conflict are unified within a mathematical framework. For example, if a conflict avalanche lasted 10 days and spread over 100 kilometers (more than 60 miles), one could use the framework to estimate the number of fatalities.</p><p>The average trajectory of conflicts revealed in the research differs from past theories that hypothesized conflicts spread like forest fires, where a long buildup, such as tinder accumulating on the forest floor, is followed by a blaze of activity that reaches an apex and then dies out. Instead, these avalanches are more mathematically \"flat,\" without the peaks of processes as in forest fires. In addition, such \"forest-fire\" models do not explain how regional variation in conflict intensity comes about and why such intensity would show the power law scaling that the researchers discovered.</p><p>According to Lee, robust conflict forecasting could eventually help inform public policy, leading to intervention strategies before conflicts gain traction.</p><p>\"These regularities could help predict trajectories of ongoing conflicts or estimate important quantities like fatalities that are hard to measure,\" Lee said. \"Large datasets on human behavior have the power to revolutionize our understanding of society.\"</p><p>The research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, the St. Andrews Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the Proteus Foundation.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Physical Review E - <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.042312\">https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.042312</url></p><p>Contact: Matt Hayes, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mmh285@cornell.edu\">mmh285@cornell.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7338269 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7338269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61NS-GDR1-DYG2-R50T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"623\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Doug Lamborn of Colorado serve on the committee. </p><p><br/>Its power, though, will be severely checked for at least the next two years by a Democratic Senate and president. <br/>In an interview with States Newsroom, Westerman, a forester with a background in engineering, said his direction for the panel would depart from that of Democrats. <br/>He'd rather focus on technology \u2014 including nuclear energy, carbon sequestration and biochar, a 2,500-year-old technique of heating wood, manure and other biomass to create carbon charcoal with multiple uses \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions and atmospheric buildup, than on limiting industry. <br/>Westerman also said he'd work to open more mining development to gather resources like cobalt, nickel, copper and others needed to build electric vehicles and additional tools of an energy transition, though he added electric vehicles' potential to reduce carbon emissions was overstated. <br/>Congress should have a role in shaping a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, he said, but lawmakers should be mindful that it's a global issue and that developing countries are not trading their own economic growth to limit emissions -\u2014 and perhaps the United States shouldn't either. <br/>'We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution,' he said. <br/>The following interview, conducted by phone on Jan. 26, has been condensed and edited for clarity. <br/>States Newsroom: Just to start out, what are your priorities for the committee's work this Congress? <br/>Bruce Westerman: You may or may not be aware of our Commitment to America (House Republicans' proposed agenda heading into the 2022 midterms[1]) that we put out. Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1392914627.jpg\">https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1392914627.jpg</url> A Hyundai Ioniq battery electric vehicle (BEV) charges at a Motor Fuel Group (MFG) EV Power forecourt on April 21, 2022, in Manchester, England. (Furlong/Getty Images) <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/donate\">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/01/30/house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009798167514124918425876100218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009798</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FD-CG11-JCMN-Y0MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567520</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3583\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://sourcenm.com/2023/01/31/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000995216751652483982587610009</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009952</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FD-CG11-JCMN-Y0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567836</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3515\"/><timeReceived>11:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN:Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW:All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/donate\">https://missouriindependent.com/donate</url><br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percentof that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW:That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe\">https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe</url><br/>SN:Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN:But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW:We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN:It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW:We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW:I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN:When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/donate\">https://missouriindependent.com/donate</url><br/>SN:Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill onnot selling oil to China[3]hashuge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN:Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called theBUILDER Act[5]that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number ofwhales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind[6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW:Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call theSave Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN:And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe\">https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe</url><br/>SN:When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW:We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN:Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/2023/01/31/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009806167518952876325876100153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009806</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FF-PDY1-JCMN-Y4XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3567\"/><timeReceived>6:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2023/01/31/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009802167520663531525876100057</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009802</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FJ-YD81-F03R-N39V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3516\"/><timeReceived>11:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

With COVID-19, supplies are coming from and subsequently shipping everywhere.\"</p><p>Circle Logistics has shifted their entire transportation network to help manage the 700% increase in volume from customers moving critical medical supplies, like personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators and cots, as well as grocery shipments for major brands. </p><p>Circle's partnership with Descartes MacroPoint is providing real-time location, status, and estimated time of arrival of the COVID-19 loads. This visibility enables the agency to closely monitor and evaluate the movement of all of freight via one platform and take corrective action before any potential supply chain disruptions occur. Circle's entire workforce has mobilized to help fill the increased shipments for FEMA and other customers during the pandemic. </p><p>\"Everyone in the Circle Logistics organization is working together, with many pulling after-hour shifts to get orders filled during the crisis,\" continued Smith. \"It's the least we can do to help keep hospitals and people supplied with the medical tools and groceries they need.\"</p><p>Established in Fort Wayne in 2011, Circle Logistics is one of the fastest-growing transportation companies in the country, servicing more than $200 million in freight spend in 2018.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN:Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW:All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percentof that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW:That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN:Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN:But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW:We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN:It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW:We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW:I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN:When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN:Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill onnot selling oil to China[3]hashuge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN:Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called theBUILDER Act[5]that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number ofwhales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind[6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW:Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call theSave Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN:And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN:When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW:We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN:Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN:Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW:All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percentof that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW:That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN:Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN:But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW:We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN:It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW:We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW:I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because of their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN:Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill onnot selling oil to China[3]hashuge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN:Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called theBUILDER Act[5]that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number ofwhales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind[6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW:Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call theSave Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN:And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN:When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW:We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN:Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/subscribe\">https://georgiarecorder.com/subscribe</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/01/31/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009800167520363341025876100176</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009800</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FJ-YD81-F03R-N39H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567725</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3527\"/><timeReceived>10:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 (trillion) to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon.

Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/> Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/><br/>All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/> Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/><br/>All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/> So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/><br/>That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/> Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/><br/>We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/> But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/><br/>We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/> It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/><br/>We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/> But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/><br/>I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/> When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/><br/>No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/> Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/><br/>The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/> Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/><br/>He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/> You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/><br/>Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/> And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/><br/>On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/> When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/><br/>It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/> OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/><br/>We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/> Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/><br/>Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009805167513284967225876100104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009805</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FB-YSW1-JCMN-Y3J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567766</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3502\"/><timeReceived>2:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) <br/>The incoming chairman of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee wants to allow more mining and believes technology \u2014 not limitations on fossil fuel production \u2014 is the best way to address climate change. </p><p><br/>As part of their organization of the chamber they now control, U.S. House Republicans selected Arkansas' Bruce Westerman to lead the panel that oversees the U.S. Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service and has a major role in shaping federal energy and environmental policy. <br/>Its power, though, will be severely checked for at least the next two years by a Democratic Senate and president. <br/>In an interview with States Newsroom, Westerman, a forester with a background in engineering, said his direction for the panel would depart from that of Democrats. <br/>Rather than limiting industry, he'd rather focus on technology \u2014 including nuclear energy, carbon sequestration and biochar, a 2,500-year-old technique of heating wood, manure and other biomass to create carbon charcoal with multiple uses \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions and atmospheric buildup. <br/>Westerman also said he'd work to open more mining development to gather resources like cobalt, nickel, copper and others needed to build electric vehicles and additional tools of an energy transition, though he added electric vehicles' potential to reduce carbon emissions was overstated. <br/>U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) <br/>Congress should have a role in shaping a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, he said, but lawmakers should be mindful that it's a global issue and that developing countries are not trading their own economic growth to limit emissions -\u2014 and perhaps the United States shouldn't either. <br/>'We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution,' he said. <br/>The following interview, conducted by phone on Jan. 26, has been condensed and edited for clarity. <br/>States Newsroom: Just to start out, what are your priorities for the committee's work this Congress? <br/>Bruce Westerman: You may or may not be aware of our Commitment to America (House Republicans' proposed agenda heading into the 2022 midterms[1]) that we put out. Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/>The post New U.S. House Natural Resources chair opposes limits on fossil fuel development[8] appeared first on Arkansas Advocate[9]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://arkansasadvocate.com\">https://arkansasadvocate.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arkansasadvocate.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10010127167512415938625876100115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10010127</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FB-YSW1-JCMN-Y3K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3589\"/><timeReceived>12:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

But new research that ties together multiple aspects of political violence reveals universal dynamics in how conflicts emerge and expand. The work provides a statistical framework that could one day help anticipate deadly violence.</p><p>Cornell researchers analyzed more than 100,000 reports of armed conflict in Africa, compiled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project over 20 years. They studied various forms of armed conflict, from battles between nation-states and violence against civilians to riots and protests, in search of common themes in seemingly complex phenomena.</p><p>\"Surprisingly, we found a universal pattern for how conflicts grow. Armed conflicts tend to follow remarkably simple statistical models,\" said Eddie Lee, M.S. '18, Ph.D. '19, and lead author on the research. \"People tend to think of conflict as very regional and context specific. We found emergent patterns that align with physical dimensions of space and time in a unified and predictable way.\"</p><p>The paper, \"A Scaling Theory for Armed Conflict Avalanches,\" was published Oct. 28 in Physical Review E. Christopher Myers, M.S. '88, Ph.D. '91, adjunct professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a co-author.</p><p>The researchers clustered together conflicts that occurred in close proximity and within a specific time frame. These clusters, called \"conflict avalanches,\" followed statistically relevant relationships between a few key variables: fatalities, duration, geographic spread and incident reports recorded in the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED).</p><p>The datasets from ACLED, which tracks political violence and protests across the world, provide a granular look into deadly violence. The Cornell researchers found that conflicts of various scales in Africa followed consistent patterns such as power law scaling, in which a change in one quantity is related to a proportional change in another.</p><p>Conflicts are notoriously difficult to measure, especially their fatalities. The research reveals how some characteristics of armed conflict are unified within a mathematical framework. For example, if a conflict avalanche lasted 10 days and spread over 100 kilometers (more than 60 miles), one could use the framework to estimate the number of fatalities.</p><p>The average trajectory of conflicts revealed in the research differs from past theories that hypothesized conflicts spread like forest fires, where a long buildup, such as tinder accumulating on the forest floor, is followed by a blaze of activity that reaches an apex and then dies out. Instead, these avalanches are more mathematically \"flat,\" without the peaks of processes as in forest fires. In addition, such \"forest-fire\" models do not explain how regional variation in conflict intensity comes about and why such intensity would show the power law scaling that the researchers discovered.</p><p>According to Lee, robust conflict forecasting could eventually help inform public policy, leading to intervention strategies before conflicts gain traction.</p><p>\"These regularities could help predict trajectories of ongoing conflicts or estimate important quantities like fatalities that are hard to measure,\" Lee said. \"Large datasets on human behavior have the power to revolutionize our understanding of society.\"</p><p>The research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, the St. Andrews Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the Proteus Foundation.</p><p>Matt Hayes is associate director for communications for Global Development in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124161648</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61KK-90T1-JCBF-S4S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Bruce Westerman (R-AR) speaks at a House Republican news conference on energy policy at the U.S. Capitol on March 8, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) </p><p><br/>The incoming chairman of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee wants to allow more mining and believes technology \u2014 not limitations on fossil fuel production \u2014 is the best way to address climate change. <br/>As part of their organization of the chamber they now control, U.S. House Republicans selected Arkansas' Bruce Westerman to lead the panel that oversees the U.S. Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service and has a major role in shaping federal energy and environmental policy. <br/>Its power, though, will be severely checked for at least the next two years by a Democratic Senate and president. <br/>In an interview with States Newsroom, Westerman, a forester with a background in engineering, said his direction for the panel would depart from that of Democrats. <br/>He'd rather focus on technology \u2014 including nuclear energy, carbon sequestration and biochar, a 2,500-year-old technique of heating wood, manure and other biomass to create carbon charcoal with multiple uses \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions and atmospheric buildup, than on limiting industry. <br/>Westerman also said he'd work to open more mining development to gather resources like cobalt, nickel, copper and others needed to build electric vehicles and additional tools of an energy transition, though he added electric vehicles' potential to reduce carbon emissions was overstated. <br/>Congress should have a role in shaping a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, he said, but lawmakers should be mindful that it's a global issue and that developing countries are not trading their own economic growth to limit emissions -\u2014 and perhaps the United States shouldn't either. <br/>'We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution,' he said. <br/>The following interview, conducted by phone on Jan. 26, has been condensed and edited for clarity. <br/>States Newsroom:Just to start out, what are your priorities for the committee's work this Congress? <br/>Bruce Westerman: You may or may not be aware of our Commitment to America (House Republicans' proposed agenda heading into the 2022 midterms[1]) that we put out. Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://alaskabeacon.com/subscribe\">https://alaskabeacon.com/subscribe</url><br/>The post New U.S. House Natural Resources chair opposes limits on fossil fuel development[8] appeared first on Alaska Beacon[9]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://alaskabeacon.com\">https://alaskabeacon.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://alaskabeacon.com/2023/01/30/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1001012516751352765502587610004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10010125</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FB-YSW1-JCMN-Y3JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567489</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3609\"/><timeReceived>3:21 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.) <br/>Its power, though, will be severely checked for at least the next two years by a Democratic Senate and president. <br/>In an interview with States Newsroom, Westerman, a forester with a background in engineering, said his direction for the panel would depart from that of Democrats. <br/>He'd rather focus on technology \u2014 including nuclear energy, carbon sequestration and biochar, a 2,500-year-old technique of heating wood, manure and other biomass to create carbon charcoal with multiple uses \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions and atmospheric buildup, than on limiting industry. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/subscribe\">https://lailluminator.com/subscribe</url><br/>Westerman also said he'd work to open more mining development to gather resources like cobalt, nickel, copper and others needed to build electric vehicles and additional tools of an energy transition, though he added electric vehicles' potential to reduce carbon emissions was overstated. <br/>Congress should have a role in shaping a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, he said, but lawmakers should be mindful that it's a global issue and that developing countries are not trading their own economic growth to limit emissions -\u2014 and perhaps the United States shouldn't either. <br/>'We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution,' he said. <br/>The following interview, conducted by phone on Jan. 26, has been condensed and edited for clarity. <br/>States Newsroom: Just to start out, what are your priorities for the committee's work this Congress? <br/>Bruce Westerman: You may or may not be aware of our Commitment to America (House Republicans' proposed agenda heading into the 2022 midterms[1]) that we put out. Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy.  <br/><br/> Need to get in touch? Have a news tip?  <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Electric-vehicle.6.jpg\">https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Electric-vehicle.6.jpg</url> A brand new Chevrolet Bolt EVU sits on the sales lot at Stewart Chevrolet on Oct. 7, 2021, in Colma, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wisconsin-wind-turbines.jpg\">https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wisconsin-wind-turbines.jpg</url> Wind turbines rise up above farmland on the outskirts of the state capital on Nov. 19, 2013 near Middleton, Wisconsin. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/donate\">https://lailluminator.com/donate</url><br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Redwood-forest.png\">https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Redwood-forest.png</url> Canva image <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/2023/01/31/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009803167517991210525876100025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009803</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FF-PDY1-JCMN-Y4XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567758</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3668\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

has only just started counting the cost of the damage caused by the weeks of fires Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>At the height of the fires in early August, the flames had reached the gates of Athens, filling the sky of the city of four million inhabitants with grey smoke. <br/>But after weeks of punishing temperatures often well over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), a lower 33 degrees Celsius was forecast for Thursday. <br/>The falling temperatures and overnight rain in Evia, the Peloponnese and central Greece had helped improve the situation, said Stathis Koulis, the mayor of Gortynia. <br/>The village of Gortynia in a mountainous area of Arcadia 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of Athens has become the primary focus in the Peloponnese, with deep ravines posing a challenge to firefighters. <br/>Twenty villages have been evacuated in the area over the past few days and 680 firefighters, including more than a hundred sent to help from France, and five water-dropping aircraft have been relentlessly battling the flames. <br/>\"I can't take it anymore,\" said farmer Kostis Angelou as he wandered between the corpses of his goats, all 372 of them burnt by a fire that devoured forests on Evia. <br/>The 44-year-old managed to survive by spending hours under an irrigation water pipe, surrounded by flames. <br/>\"A saint saved me,\" he said. <br/>The latest extreme weather events come after a \"code red\" report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published on Monday warning that the world is warming far faster than previously feared. <br/>The Mediterranean has been singled out as a \"climate change hotspot\", with increasing temperatures and aridity lengthening fire seasons and doubling the areas potential burnt, according to draft IPCC assessment seen exclusively by AFP. <br/>Algeria announced three days of national mourning starting Thursday for the 69 dead killed in blazes there. <br/>Five have died in fires in Italy, where what is believed to be a new European record of 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 Fahrenheit) was registered in Sicily on Wednesday -- beating the previous high recorded in Greece in 1977.

I'm Kim Brunhuber. We begin with breaking news with what some call a once-in-a-half-century extreme weather happening right now in Florida. As we speak, up to 20 inches of rain has fallen in parts of South Florida in the past few hours. With more in the forecast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Will that lead to a flash flood emergency. The highest possible level of flood warning. So, what you see here is the Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport, which is partly underwater and closed until at least noon on Thursday. The city of Fort Lauderdale has activated its emergency operations center and plans to issue a local state of emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Officials also say airboats and high-water vehicles will join rescue operations in the coming hours. For the latest we go to meteorologist Britley Ritz here in Atlanta who's keeping an eye on all of this. Obviously, really folks in Florida used to storms but, you know, what we're seeing now so unusual. Take us through what they're seeing and what they can expect.</p><p>BRITLEY RITZ, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. Thankfully things have tamed down a bit. Kim. But unfortunately, still dealing with flood warnings throughout the overnight hours and early morning hours with just a few more inches of rain expected for some of these areas. As for rainfall totals, Dania Beach over 13 inches. And Lauderdale pushing over 12 inches. These are estimated preliminary rainfall totals.</p><p>So, there's still room for more to come. 10 to 20 inches right there near the airport. Now if that's the case, if we hit 20 inches and we verify that, that means we have hit a once-in-1000, onceoin-5000-year rainfall amount. Folks this is a very serious situation. So, do not drive the roadways. 12 to 18 inches of moving water to lift your vehicle right off the ground and many are already stranded. I've seen video of it.</p><p>Thankfully, the rain chances have tamed back a bit for Southeast Florida but that same area of low pressure that brought the rain there working its way up through the Panhandle and right up into parts of Mobile, some flooding possible there as the heavier rain starts to set in. So, through your Thursday afternoon that rain pushes up through the Panhandle and then finally starts to taper back late Thursday and into Friday.</p><p>Rainfall totals to come through Friday and additional one, possibly two inches of rain along the east coast of Florida. Again, the heavier rain will be concentrated around Mobile. Another two to four inches possible. And we also have the threat for stronger storms too. With the spin of that low we not only bring in heavy rain but also the threat for isolated tornadoes. Record warmth also a possibility.</p><p>Some of these locations could be dealing with temperatures well above their normal. 65 possible record temperatures broken from the Midwest to the Northeast. Kim?</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right. Thanks so much really, Britley Ritz. Appreciate it. Now, two new studies show water levels are rising much faster than previously thought in cities along the southeastern U.S. coast. Experts say that's even fueling more powerful hurricanes and stronger storm surges. One analysis shows an increase of almost five inches or more than 12 centimeters over the past decade.</p><p>Cities at most risk include Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, and Miami. So, joining me now is a co-author of one of those studies. Tor Tornqvist is a Vokes geology professor at Tulane University in New Orleans. Thanks so much for being here with us. So first, I just want to get your take on what we're seeing right now in Florida. I mean, we keep -- seem to experience these once-in-a-century-type of weather events, but they seem to be becoming the new normal.</p><p>TOR TORNQWIST, VOKES GEOLOGY PROFESSOR, TULANE UNIVERSITY: Yes. That's the world we live in now, right? So now, of course, the relationship between sea level rise and hurricanes is something we're still trying to figure out. And the study I was involved in was primarily focused on sea level change. But of course, rising sea levels will make the impact of hurricanes worse, right? Even if they're hurricane climates wouldn't change if you start off from a higher baseline, the impact will be worse.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes. And Florida, one of the state's most vulnerable to sea level rise, I read by 2050. The sea could be a foot higher than it is now. And this is one of the states that your research found was experiencing accelerating sea level rise. So, take us through your findings</p><p>[02:05:04]</p><p>TORNQWIST: Yes. So, it turns out that starting roughly around the year 2010 that the rate of sea level rise in, say, the southeastern part of the United States, so roughly from North Carolina, southward all the way down to South Texas, the rate of sea level rise has increased really dramatically. And we basically looked at rates that are exceeding 10 millimeters per year, which is, you know, at least twice, if not three times the global average.</p><p>So, this is clearly an unusual situation. And part of this is, of course, the result of climate change and global warming and rising, you know, accelerating sea levels that we see in most of the world. But in this particular region, we see that the rate has gone up much higher and say last 10 to 12 years.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Yes. How worrying is that and what effect could that have?</p><p>TORNQWIST: Well, it is obviously worrisome because it already has had effects in, you know, one of the things we see increase a lot is, you know, what we call nuisance flooding where, you know, during high tide, that areas that rarely or almost never flooded in the past, they start to flood much more frequently. Now, these are not really catastrophic events but they really mess with people's daily lives.</p><p>And so, those are the types of things that we see becoming much more common. And that is likely to continue in the future.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: I was just in your state of Louisiana where you are right now this week. And these issues, you know, when you talk to people, they're top of mind for many people, but the people I talked to, it wasn't necessarily because of the environmental reasons or even because they perceive, they themselves are under greater threat of flooding and sea level rise. The issue for many folks is insurance, it's become so expensive to get insurance, if you live anywhere near the water. Many folks can't afford it anymore.</p><p>So, when we talk about this idea of managed retreat, the idea of encouraging or even forcing people away from these flood prone areas. I mean, is that what has to happen, basically trying to price people out of these areas to get out of these areas that could face sea level rise?</p><p>Tore Yes. Well, that's a really good question. And I can actually speak to that, at a very personal level because I lost my insurance last winter. And that to very, very quickly find a new insurer for my home. And that is -- that is a common thing around here. There are, of course, areas, I'm lucky that I live in a -- in a city that is still reasonably well protected. But people who live in more outlying areas closer to the coast, they often face a situation that they can barely get any insurance.</p><p>And you're right. That is leading to, you know, that certainly could have contributed to population loss that we start to see in, you know, parts of the state that are closer to the coast. And in fact, there was a report just last week that -- I think four out of the top 10 counties in the United States, in terms of population loss are here in South Louisiana. And, you know, that has to do with big storms, like we've had, you know, a lot of major hurricanes in the last few years.</p><p>And that leads to people leaving. And, of course, people try to come back but not everyone comes back. And yes, that leads to, you know, what you're referring to this retreat. BRUNHUBER: Yes. It's certainly really concerning, especially as we watch the situation in Florida now just reminder of how much is at stake. Tor Tornqwist, thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>TORNQWIST: Thank you.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right. Breaking news just into CNN. An appeals court has just issued a ruling on the fate of a key medication abortion drug in the U.S. It decided to partially grant the Justice Department's request to freeze a judge's ruling that had invalidated the FDA's approval of Mifepristone but it left in place parts of the order that halted changes to make the abortion pill more easily accessible.</p><p>[02:10:10]</p><p>So, that effectively will make the drug harder to obtain as the legal process plays out. The case could ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. We're learning new details about who might be behind the leak of highly classified documents from the Pentagon. The Washington Post reports they posted -- they were posted in a chat room by a man who worked at an unidentified military base.</p><p>He's described as a young gun enthusiast who was chatting with about two dozen people on the social media platform Discord which is popular with video gamers. Now CNN can't independently verify the report. But the post cites an interview with a friend of the alleged leaker was also a member of the Discord chat group.</p><p>Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was about three other members in the voice chat with me when I first found out that these were public -- made public. It felt like my heart was beating out of its chest and my legs were buckling and I could not believe that this was happening. We didn't realize the sheer -- just immense nature of these leaks until a bit later.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Now the source refused to name the alleged leaker. The documents posted online revealed U.S. efforts to spy on the number of its closest allies.</p><p>Emotional moment in Louisville, Kentucky Wednesday evening, hundreds gathered for a vigil to grieve and honor the five lives lost in Monday's bank shootings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me.</p><p>GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Tommy, Josh, Juliana, Jim, Diana. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, children, friends, each one a child of God. These are irreplaceable Kentuckians taken far too soon by a senseless act of violence that is certainly making me feel heartbroken. And I think all of us torn.</p><p>CRAIG GREENBERG, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY MAYOR: Whether you knew some of these wonderful people who were killed on Monday or not become together this evening to acknowledge that every violent death is tragic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Police have now released 911 calls detailing the panic and fear during the shooting including one from the gunman's mother. Shimon Procupekz reports on what we're learning and we just want to warn you, you may find some of the video disturbing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know what to do. I need your help.</p><p>SHIMON PROCUPEKZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: A mom calls 911 after she was told her son had a gun and was headed to the Louisville Bank where he worked.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My son might have a gun and he is heading to the Old National.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: But she said she didn't believe her 25-year-old son was a threat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And please he's not violent. He's never done anything. Please. He's --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. And you don't believe he owns guns?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know he doesn't own any guns.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: But she would wind up being wrong and the call came too late.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God, there's an active shooter there.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: Her son was already inside the bank where he worked shooting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe he had a rifle, a gun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has anybody been shot?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: On 911 Call her hiding from the gunman.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm in the closet with one person. I hear -- I hear -- I hear gunshots. PROCUPEKZ: And bank employees watching the attack unfold on a video conference meeting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We heard multiple shots and everybody started saying, oh my God.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And then he came into the boardroom.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Stay --</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: The gunman livestreams the attack on Instagram. It was just one minute before he sat down and waited for police to arrive.</p><p>DEPUTY CHIEF PAUL HUMPHREY, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: He went to the front lobby after assaulting the victims in the office area, and he could see out where no one could see in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please get people there fast, please.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: The shooter used an A.R.-15-style rifle he'd legally bought six days before the attack according to police.</p><p>Body camera video shows Louisville Metro Police officers responding.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're making an entry from the -- from the East Side (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>[02:15:02]</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: And heading toward the gunfire.</p><p>Twenty-six-year-old officer Nicholas Wilt is shot in the head and critically injured.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And we have a gunshot wound of an officer.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: His training officer Cory Galloway takes cover, but it's also shot before he returns fire and kills the gunman.</p><p>INTERIM CHIEF JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: Timing is as we all know is everything but not having officers to hesitate, but actually really go in and say I need to stop this threat.</p><p>PROCUPEKZ: No words can express our sorrow, anguish and horror at the unthinkable harm. A statement from the family's lawyers said. But they also said that he struggled with depression. While the shooter like many of his contemporaries had mental health challenges, which we as a family were actively addressing. There were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: A Democratic lawmaker kicked out of the Tennessee State Government for demanding stricter gun laws after a deadly school shooting has been reinstated. The Shelby County Board of Commissioners voted on Wednesday to send Justin Pearson back to the Tennessee House of Representatives. The Republican supermajority had expelled Pearson and two other Democrats accusing them of intentionally causing disorder and dishonor after they held a lot of protests in the chamber.</p><p>But Pearson made it clear he's back and he's fired up. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STATE REP. JUSTIN PEARSON (D) TENNESSEE: They try to kill democracy. They tried to expel the people's choice and the people's vote. And awakened a sleeping giant.</p><p>They put Gloria Johnson and Justin Jones and me on trial but they ended up putting themselves on trial, and the people's verdict is back. Guilty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: The motion to reappoint Pearson passed unanimously after the board suspended a rule that would have required a waiting period between Pearson's nomination and confirmation.</p><p>Up next. Horrific videos claimed to show Russian fighters be heading Ukrainian soldiers. We'll have reaction from Kyiv and the United Nations.</p><p>Plus, fears are growing of a second mobilization across Russia as lawmakers vote to make it harder to evade the draft. This is CNN NEWSROOM. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:21:22]</p><p>BRUNHUBER: In a yearlong war already marked by immeasurable human suffering. Some Russian fighters in Ukraine have currently sunk to a horrifying new level of depravity. Beheading Ukrainian soldiers on video then posting those videos online for the world to see. Now, CNN has chosen not to show those videos. They're just too graphic but we're about to show several still images from the scene which are obviously disturbing in their own right.</p><p>So, these were taken from video posted on a pro Russian social media channel last week. They prompted yet another war crimes investigation by Ukrainian authorities. Now their video appears to show the bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers next to a destroyed military vehicle. And you can hear a person laughing and then a Russian saying someone came up to the soldiers and cut off their heads.</p><p>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the perpetrators beasts serious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE: This video shows Russia as it is. What kind of creatures are they? They don't care about a human being. A son, a brother, a husband, someone's child. This video shows Russia trying to make it a new normal in this habit of destroying life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: There's growing fear in Russia, the President Vladimir Putin may be preparing for a second military mobilization. Lawmakers have voted to make it easier to draft conscripts and harder to evade military service. The new law would allow for the electronic delivery of call up papers and band travel abroad for those eligible for the draft. Anyone who ignores orders to report could be barred from getting a loan moving into the new apartment or driving a vehicle.</p><p>All right. Let's go live to London and CNN's Clare Sebastian. So, Clare, take us through what's behind this and whether it signals another mobilization.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kim, the Kremlin is at pains to point out that this has nothing to do they say with another wave of mobilization. This is simply aimed at modernizing the process fixing the mess in the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov of the last mobilization that started at the end of September last year. I think the fear in Russia is one that many believed that that mobilization never officially ended.</p><p>No decree was ever signed despite the government saying that it had achieved this goal. And secondly, this is not only potentially a way of easing the process for another mobilization, removing friction by allowing those electronic call-up papers, making it easier for the government to do another mobilization should it choose to do so but then it also provides cover this idea of fixing the mess provides cover but yet another increase in repression and surveillance on the Russian people which as we know, has been a hallmark of this conflict.</p><p>Those penalties for not showing up to a recruitment office. One, you can't leave the country once you've been served, that notice even if you haven't read it. Two, you have 20 days elapsed and you haven't shown up at a recruitment office, the penalties are pretty coercive. You can't take out a loan, you can't register a new car or drive it. Things like that that could really push people into complying.</p><p>So, I think that is one of the big fears. We did, of course having the Kremlin saying that it has nothing to do with another wave of mobilization. But we also had from the Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin who said that he believes the entire country should be mobilized. His comments are not directly aligned with the Kremlin. He also criticized the bureaucratic system saying the \"anthill should be cleaned out and its numbers reduced.\"</p><p>But this is part of what we see that sort of calls and moves towards the militarization of society, the prioritization of the military and the subjugation of the Russian people for that purpose. Kim?</p><p>[02:25:03]</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right. Thanks so much. Clare Sebastian in London.</p><p>Well, Joe Biden is getting a very warm welcome in the country he's called part of his soul. We're live in Dublin with U.S. President's plans while on the Emerald Isle. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: President Biden says being back in Ireland feels wonderful and feels like home. Have a look here.</p><p>Cheering crowds welcome Joe Biden to County Louth where his great grandfather was born. In the hours ahead he'll meet with the Irish president and prime minister and deliver remarks to Parliament.</p><p>Also, on the agenda, a special banquet dinner at Dublin Castle. This less intense leg of his trip follows a visit to Northern Ireland when called on the main political parties to end their stalemate and resume the power sharing arrangement.</p><p>All right. So, let's bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak who is live in Dublin. So, Kevin, a mix of business and pleasure for the President. Take us through this leg of the visit. And what's expected later.</p><p>[02:30:03]</p><p>KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes. If yesterday's visit to Belfast is really kind of about this diplomatic engagement, hailing American diplomacy when it comes to Good Friday Agreement. The next several days are really about President Biden trying to explore his Irish roots here in the Republic of Ireland. And you saw that unfold display yesterday and County Louth, the president touring streets packed with people thousands, who came out in the cold drizzle to see the American president. He was so enthusiastic, he asked, I can't even understand why my ancestors left this country.</p><p>Of course, they left because of the famine. And, you know, he did tour Carlingford castle, he was able to climb up at a tower, look out over the port of Newry. And that is where his great-great-great grandfather own funding and departed for the United States in 1849 in search of a better life. And, you know, so much about this trip is about the past President Biden's past of it really today is about Ireland's present, in the whole meet with the President of Ireland to meet with the Taoiseach of Ireland. And really so much about this country's changed, of course, since President Biden's ancestors departed.</p><p>It's even changed, you know, since President Kennedy visited 70 years ago, it's changed even in the last 15 years. It's really one of the European Union's top economies, it's turned into a very progressive country. they've passed referendums allowing same sex marriage, allowing abortion really throwing off the weight of the Catholic church that had been so predominant on this island for so many centuries. And so, President Biden will be looking to talk about shared values with these leaders when he sits in meets with them today. Also, talking about global issues, including Ukraine, Ireland has taken in more than 75,000 Ukrainian refugees. But really, this trip is really about the President's own personal connections to this island. The President's advisors really aren't making much attempt to talk to make this into a policy trip. It's really more about the personal and that will continue tomorrow, when the President goes to the west of Ireland to County Mayo. He'll speak in front of a cathedral that has a historic symbolic symbolism to his own family. And that's before he returns to Washington on Friday.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, we'll be following along. Thanks so much, Kevin Liptak, in Dublin. By the hundreds of thousands, they'll take to the streets again, French citizens furious over President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the age of pensions by two years. So, we'll go to Paris to find out more about the momentous decision on those reforms. It's just days away. Please stay with us.</p><p>[02:35:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Hundreds of thousands of protesters are expected to take to the streets across France in the coming hours. It will be the 12th day of massive strikes and demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reforms. And our CNN's Saskya Vandoorne tells us from Paris. Macron is paying a heavy political price.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER (voiceover): Anger on the streets of France. Macron resign, protesters all united against a defiant president.</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): If you want the pact between generations to be fair, this reform needs to be carried out.</p><p>VANDOORNE (voiceover): Pension reforms were a landmark policy of President Emmanuel Macron's reelection campaign. But upping the retirement age from 62 to 64, may have been a step too far for too many. Forcing the bill passed one of the two parliamentary chambers pouring fuel on the fire of popular anger. Much of that ire has come Macron's way.</p><p>DOMINIQUE MOISI, POLITICAL ANALYST: Now, it is really against denunciation of the President himself. I don't think in the history of the Fifth Republic. We have seen so much rage, so much hatred at our president.</p><p>VANDOORNE (voiceover): With most French people polled supporting the protests. His approval ratings are nearly the lowest of his two terms at just 28 percent in March. It was only worse during the yellow vest protests. Four years ago, popularity at rock bottom, hundreds of thousands in the streets weekly. For Macron the yellow vests protesting what they called Economic Injustice is upset his first term. He now faces a similar risk. (on camera) The deficit balancing moves slammed by many as tone deaf, will face its final hurdle here Friday. France is the equivalent of the Supreme Court. It will either rubber stamp it or deny that some parts or indeed the whole thing is unconstitutional, which would be a further embarrassment for President Macron.</p><p>(voiceover) For the young reformer, pensions were supposed to be the first of several policy revamps. But his crusade of government reform now looks dead in the water. With little hope of energizing lawmakers behind yet more controversial policy rethinks. And his legacy may be even more troubled, opening the door to the fall right.</p><p>MOISI: The comparison with Barack Obama applies. His paving the way to the coming to power of a populist leader and he will be remembered in history as the man who allowed Marine Le Pen, to finally come to power.</p><p>VANDOORNE (voiceover): With four years remaining in his term as president. We may still not know the true cost of Macron's hunger for reform for quite a while.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VANDOORNE (on camera): We expect up to 600,000 people to take to the streets today. And they're going to be taken to the streets, it's not only to voice their opposition at the pension reform. But also, really because it's the last time that they might have an opportunity to be heard by the Constitutional Council who will be voting on the law tomorrow. So, it's their way to trying apply pressure to the nine court appointees who will be voting on that law tomorrow, Kim.</p><p>[02:40:17]</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, we'll be following that story. Thank you so much, Saskya Vandoorne in Paris, appreciate it. Right now, severe tropical cyclone is barreling toward Western Australia and when it makes landfall in the coming hours. Ilsa is expected to be one of the most powerful storms to hit the region in more than a decade. Storm is currently headed toward the coast with the strength of a category four hurricane. Authorities are piling up the sandbags and residents are being urged to get to safer ground. I'm Kim Brunhuber, for our international viewers, \"WORLD SPORT\" is next. For those of you here in North America. I'll be back with more CNN NEWSROOM in just a moment. Please do stick with us.</p><p>[02:45:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: All right, have a look at these dramatic images showing a tractor trailer hanging from an overpass in the state of Pennsylvania. Police say the vehicle hit the cement barrier and overturned on a curve. The driver managed to escape was just minor injuries, luckily. Recycling plant fire in the state of Indiana has forced thousands of people from their homes with no idea when they might be able to return. That's because the thick black smoke from the plastics that are burning is definitely toxic. According to the State Fire Marshal, the farm will likely burn for days.</p><p>Residents were advised to stay indoors, conserve energy, limit engine use in their vehicles and not burn anything that could add more harmful smoke to the region. Meanwhile, details from a 2019 city meeting about the facility revealed a long list of problems among them. The building had no sprinkler system and may contain asbestos. Crews in Wisconsin are working to get a wildfire under control. Authorities say it has burned through about 100-acres in Juneau County and is still growing. On Wednesday Wisconsin's governor declared a state of emergency.</p><p>So far, no injuries have been reported. And officials in New Jersey say a forest fire is 75 percent contained. Nobody has been injured in the fire which burned through nearly 4,000-acres. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is back in Manhattan to face another legal battle. He's expected to be deposed in the civil lawsuit filed by New York attorney Letitia James, who accuses Trump and his three adult children of fraud for providing false financial statements to lenders. Meanwhile, Trump has filed a $500 million dollar lawsuit against his former Attorney Michael Cohen. Trump is accusing his former fixer of breaching his contract. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has details from Washington.</p><p>KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Donald Trump is suing his former Attorney Michael Cohen, related to everything that Cohen is saying publicly now about Trump. Especially around his charges in New York and the hush money payments that Cohen was funneling to Stormy Daniels before Trump's 2016 election to keep her quiet. Now, this is a new lawsuit that Trump is filing in his now favorite venue, the federal court in Florida. And he's asking for $500 million in damages, basically saying that Cohen was spreading false information about him. And also, may have breached contracts by talking about his work for Donald Trump his clients.</p><p>So, attorney client relationship and also, talking about his time as an employee of the Trump organization. Now, when Cohen was talking publicly, much of it has been done in the course of criminal investigations, at least to prosecutors who are building the case around him as a key witness. But he's also been out there on podcasts in a book tour, doing many media interviews about Donald Trump. And so, Trump is taking issue with that, we do know previously, Cohen has actually tried to sued Trump himself to pay for his legal fees whenever he was participating in a federal investigation around this.</p><p>And in that separate federal investigation long ago that this investigation in New York that brought the charges against Donald Trump. Grew out of we know that there was a finding Cohen was actually doing very little legal work for Donald Trump at that time. But Donald Trump still wants to protect all of this interaction he may have had with Michael Cohen. The prosecutors say was ultimately illegal behavior. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.</p><p>BRUNHUBER: Now, in response to the lawsuit, Michael Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis issued this statement quote, \"Mr. Trump is once again using and abusing the judicial system as a form of harassment and intimidation against Mr. Michael Cohen. Mr. Cohen will not be deterred and is confident that the suit will fail based on the facts and the law.\" According to the Washington Post, the Special Counsel is looking into whether Donald Trump used false claims about the Presidential Election being stolen to fundraise.</p><p>We're hearing a bunch of new subpoenas have been issued. Newspaper reports that federal prosecutors investigating the January sixth attack on the U.S. Capitol have recently sought a wide variety of documents related to fundraising after the 2020 election. And it says they're quote, \"Seeking to determine if Trump or his advisor's scammed donors by using false claims about voter fraud to raise money.\" According to eight people familiar with the new inquiries. A Washington Post reporter who worked on the story spoke to CNN. Here's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVLIN BARRETT, REPORTER, WASHINGTON POST: What's important here, I think is we're seeing them drilling down on to this question to ask a very specific question which is, how are these email solicitations? How were they crafted? How are they written? How are they changed and edited? And what were the people making those pitches for money saying to each other about these claims?</p><p>[02:50:11]</p><p>Because there's one comparison case where you could say that the claims that were being made, the appeals being made for money were being made by people who in some ways may have known that they were not telling the truth. And that is the real question that prosecutors have to try to answer here. Was there a known misstatement, known misrepresentations to just generate money because these appeals generated tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUNHUBER: During selection is set to begin in the day ahead in Dominion voting systems $1.6 billion defamation suit against Fox News. The judge in the case is sanctioning the network for possibly withholding key evidence and lying to the court. He plans to appoint an outside attorney known as a special master to investigate. CNN's Randi Kaye has a look at some of the explosive evidence that's already come to light.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, HOST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: The outcome of our presidential election was seized from the hands of voters.</p><p>RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Fox News host Tucker Carlson, backing former President Donald Trump on air. But private text messages sent by Carlson, released as part of the Dominion voting systems lawsuit against Fox news, show how he really feels about Trump. According to the messages Carlson actually hates Trump passionately and views his presidency as a disaster. Two days before the Capitol insurrection, Carlson wrote, \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait.\" On January 6, Carlson texted his producer calling Trump, \"A demonic force, a destroyer.\" Carlson described Trump's post-election behavior as disgusting.</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Is the fix already in?</p><p>KAYE (voiceover): It wasn't just Carlson, other Fox hosts who repeatedly featured Trump's election fraud claims on air.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, HOST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Nobody liked Dominion voting systems.</p><p>KAYE (voiceover): Where also mocking Trump and his lawyers behind the scenes. Court documents reveal Fox anchors and executives used words like \"ludicrous mind-blowingly nuts and totally insane.\" Carlson texted other hosts including Laura Ingraham, about Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, saying, \"Powell is lying by the way I caught her it's insane.\" Ingram responded. \"Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her.\" Court documents released in the case also include an email from Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch, describing Trump's election lies as \"bull and damaging.\"</p><p>In Murdoch's January deposition, he conceded that some Fox hosts we're endorsing Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen. Murdoch said, \"I would have liked us to be stronger and denouncing it, in hindsight.\" Murdoch's deposition also reveals that he rejected his own network's conspiracy theories about dominion. When asked by Dominions lawyers, \"Do you believe that dominion was engaged in a massive and coordinated effort to steal the 2020 presidential election?\" Murdock replied, \"No.\"</p><p>Promotion of the false claims was also rejected by the network's D.C. Managing Editor Court documents show, \"In my 22 years affiliated with Fox, this is the closest thing I've seen to an existential crisis, at least journalistically.\" Bill Sammon wrote to a colleague. Still, Fox News denies wrongdoing and says it was reporting on newsworthy allegations about the election. Why were Fox hosting one thing on the air and something else privately? Dominion contends this was all about business and not alienating the base loyal to Trump. When Fox reporters tried to report the facts, they were attacked. Court filing show Tucker Carlson was livid, after a Fox News reporter factcheck Trump's tweet about votes allegedly being destroyed.</p><p>Carlson texted coworkers, \"Please get her fired. Seriously, what the F, it needs to stop immediately like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company. The stock price is down. Not a joke.\" Documents from court also show Fox News Chief Suzanne Scott was furious after a correspondent for the network factcheck Trump's election lies, warning it was bad for business. In this email, Scott said, \"This has to stop now. The audience is furious, and we're just feeding the material, bad for business.\" In another revealing email Murdoch explained why Hannity continued to promote election lies, saying, \"Hannity had been privately disgusted by Trump for weeks, but was scared to lose viewers.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYE (on camera): These legal filings really show how worried Fox hosts and Fox Executives were about not only losing business, but also losing viewers certainly to Newsmax which was also pushing these false election conspiracy theories. And if you look at the breadth of the text messages and the emails that were released, you can see Fox's business model at least according to dominion. When you look at all of that it's really not about delivering the truth Dominion says, it's about pushing content and feeding the viewer with these conspiracy theories, which will keep them hooked. And more specifically Dominion has said that has alleged in the lawsuit that Fox News recklessly disregarded the truth because it was good for business. And now Dominion is saying that the emails, texts and deposition testimony speak for themselves.

Dave Gray, director of CLE, served as master of ceremony for the event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Topics at this year's symposium included offshore wind energy, solar farm mitigation strategies, food waste, land conservation, nature-based and construction solutions, solutions to decreasing plastic pollution, algae bloom across Virginia, partnerships in the Chesapeake Bay and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The keynote session featured three newly appointed state government officials: Rob Farrell, director of the Department of Forestry (DoF), Mike Rolband, director of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Matthew Wells, director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).</p><p>Farrell serves as the eighth state forester of Virginia as well as the director of the DoF, which is responsible for protecting the forest resources of Virginia and ensuring trees and forests provide the greatest possible sustainable social, ecological, and economic benefits to the commonwealth. He joined the DoF as an area forester serving Gloucester and Mathews counties in 2000. He also served the agency as the first director of the forestland conservation program and as deputy state forester. In his opening statement at the symposium, he stated that two thirds of Virginia are covered in forest, a significant part of the commonwealth, and he supports and encourages good management of the forest. He stated that \"job number one is forest fire prevention,\" with which he believes the department has done an exceptional job, \"and our second mission is protecting the water during timber harvest.\" He also stated that he is proud of the conservation easement program, a legal agreement between a landowner and a government agency or land trust that permanently limits future development of the land to protect its conservation values, while providing a tax reduction for the landowner.</p><p>Rolband founded Wetland Studies and Solutions Inc. (WSSI) in 1991 and grew his company into a multidisciplinary natural and cultural resources consulting firm with a staff of more than 200. His firm constructed the first LEED Gold facility in Virginia and utilized multiple low impact development practices for stormwater management in 2005. In 2014, WSSI was acquired by The Davey Tree Expert Co. and under Rolband's leadership, expanded to include offices in Maryland and across Virginia. WSSI assisted land developers and public works agencies navigate the Clean Water Act, Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and local environmental regulations. During his talk at the symposium, Rolband stated that the DEQ has a strong foundation, and he wants to build on it to make it better. He cited four main initiatives:</p><p>1. \"One DEQ\": The DEQ has six regional offices and a central office and Rolband wants a better balance of the workload among the offices to improve efficiency.</p><p>2. Permitting Enhancement &amp; Evaluation Platform (PEEP): Rolband is developing a critical path management scheduling system for every class of permits that DEQ touches making the permitting process easier and more efficient. People applying for permits will be able to monitor the permit process online.</p><p>3. Stormwater Programs: Rolband plans on creating one comprehensive manual that does not expire. Currently there are five manuals that have conflicting rules and regulations. After the completion of the one manual, he plans to have training and certification requirements to reduce workloads.</p><p>4. Commodity Trading: There are streams, wetlands, and nutrients credits. Rolband currently sees there is a lack of information regarding supply, demand, and price. He wants a commodity trading platform that lets people buy and sell credits in real time and which get extinguished when associated with a permit used.</p><p>Wells has 20 years of experience related to Virginia politics, policy, and environmental advocacy. Most recently, he was the Senior Regional Manager for State Government Relations for WestRock, a global leader in sustainable fiber-based packaging solutions. Before joining WestRock in 2016, Wells held senior analyst and special advisory positions with Virginia's departments of Motor Vehicles and Alcohol Beverage Control. He holds a degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia and a certificate in sustainability from Virginia Commonwealth University. Wells stated that the parks and preserves are the \"backbone of our quality of life.\" His focus will be on the Chesapeake Bay and the maintenance of the 2,700 dams in the state. He stated, \"We must take care of our people, so my first priority is safety.\" He added that flood prevention and land conservation are also crucial.</p><p>A meaningful part of the annual symposium, is the announcement of the winner of the Captain Ron Erchul Environmental Leadership Award. This year's winner is Bettina Ring, the chief sustainability and diversity officer for the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. The award recognizes a Virginian who has made significant individual efforts to improve the environment. Members of Virginia's environmental community nominate candidates who are judged based on their vision, expertise, commitment, integrity, communication skills, accomplishments, and diplomacy. The award is named for the late VMI professor Ronald A. Erchul, Ph.D., founder of the Environment Virginia Symposium.</p><p>Ring is an innovative and thoughtful leader with more than 30 years of expertise in the public sector and nonprofit management, natural resources management, land and water conservation, agriculture and food systems, rural economic development, and public policy. During her very impactful career, she has served as Virginia's fourth Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry, as state forester (director of Virginia Department of Forestry), deputy state forester, senior vice president at American Forest Foundation, and in leadership roles with several other nonprofits.</p><p>Ring has been involved in the Virginia Department of Forestry water quality efforts since early in her career, worked on the Healthy Forested Watershed Project, and served on the Chesapeake Bay Principal Staff Committee for the last four years.</p><p>In addition to her trade missions and promotion of Virginia's No. 1 and No. 3 industries, Ring also worked with former Governor Ralph Northam '81 and the General Assembly to increase funding for Agriculture Best Management Practices, riparian buffers, and watershed positions, and most recently in the proposed funding for re-opening New Kent Forestry Center to expand seedling capacity in the state, Trees for Clean Water and urban tree canopy, establishing the first-ever state funding for urban and community forestry and land conservation including farmland preservation funding specifically designed to address heirs property issues.</p><p>She took an active role, working with the UVA Institute for Engagement and Negotiation, to put on the Governor's Summit on Equitable Collaboration.</p><p>\"Ring is an outstanding leader who is very worthy of being named this year's Erchul Award winner,\" said Joe Maroon, executive director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment.</p><p>Each year, Virginia Military Institute donates $1,500 to a nonprofit environmental organization of the recipient's choice in their honor. Ring has requested that this donation be made to Virginia Natural Resources Leadership Institute.</p><p>Other awards presented at the symposium are the Governor's Environmental Excellence Awards, which recognize successful and innovative efforts that improve Virginia's environment. This year's gold medal winners are: Catawba Hospital for Greening of Government; the City of Harrisonburg Department of Public Works for the Harrisonburg urban forestry program; Coastal Virginia Ecotourism Alliance for the Virginia Water Trail; Fauquier County for Upper Rappahannock River Water Trail; George Mason University for Mason Sustainability Council's Circular Economy &amp; Zero Waste task force and the University of Virginia for waste minimization.</p><p>Silver medal winners are the City of Petersburg for Appomattox River Trail University Boulevard Overlook &amp; Trailhead; Virginia Tech for Plastic Pollution and Solid Waste Reduction Campus Wide Working Group and William &amp; Mary for institutionalized composting.</p><p>Receiving bronze medal awards are Arlington-Fairfax Chapter Inc., Izaak Walton League of America for their environmental management system;

More than 300 fire officers were involved in fighting the blazes, and two ports were closed and flights suspended on Corsica. Power was cut to 2,000 homes. </p><p>The storm also continued to batter other parts of Europe. Fallen trees blocked roads and train tracks in southern Germany and Austria. The Austrian city of Salzburg near the German border was hit by the storm today. Public broadcaster ORF reported that more than 400 firefighters worked for hours to remove downed trees from crushed cars and roads. They also had to remove a huge metal roof that was blown off a building. No one was injured, ORF reported. German railroad operator Deutsche Bahn, which had shut down all long-distance trains yesterday, said most of its service resumed today with the exception of some trains in southern regions that were still being battered by gusty winds. Deaths due to the fierce storm were reported in Poland, Sweden, Britain, Slovenia, Germany and the Czech Republic. Today, Polish officials reported a third storm-related death in the country, saying a relative of two people who were killed yesterday when the roof of the ski rental building collapsed had also died. In northern Bavaria, where a gust of over 100 mph was recorded, the storm produced a record amount of electricity being fed into the German grid from wind turbines, equivalent to almost 44 nuclear power plants. In England and Scotland, the Met Office national weather agency still had 85 flood warnings in force as torrential rains caused numerous rivers to overflow their banks. Farther north, in Norway, water from the North Sea overflowed harbors and entered houses along the country's southern coast, causing damage but claiming no victims. In the Czech Republic, more than 40,000 households remained without electricity this morning, down from some 300,000 yesterday afternoon. -- Kirsten Grieshaber, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-N2S1-JBSK-R18N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I was excited at the prospect of leaving my lockdown life behind, to see family and loved ones- to finally live and experience life without fear. Unfortunately, things have not changed much for most of the world. The 'new normal' is normal now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Covid-19 remains a threat, many of us forgot about the other bigger threat to humanity. A looming monster that has been around for much longer putting millions in harm's way. Unfortunately, there is no cure yet for this menace and once again, the world needs to tackle this problem collectively, head-on.</p><p>At the start of 2021, the world was beset by climate emergencies one after another. We have seen extreme weather events, from the chilling polar vortex in North America, the super cyclones in Africa, to the devastating floods in Australia and parts of Asia. There were also record-breaking sandstorms and unprecedented wildfires.</p><p>Scientists have long sounded the alarm on the climate crisis. Until world governments come together and commit to ambitious action for climate and social equity, no one is safe.</p><p>January</p><p>Record-breaking snow in Spain</p><p>The year started with an unprecedented snowstorm in Spain. On the 8th of January, Filomena brought record-breaking cold waves and heavy snowfall in the Spanish capital Madrid which has not experienced such a phenomenon since 1917. Filomena also paralyzed many parts of the country, disrupting air and land transport.</p><p>Flash floods in Indonesia</p><p>Floods caused by seasonal heavy rainfall, massive land clearing for palm oil and coal mining in South Kalimantan resulted in water levels rising up to two meters. The floods inundated hundreds of houses and forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and find shelter on higher ground.</p><p>Seoul, South Korea recorded its coldest day in 35 years. On January 5th, official overnight temperature hit -18.6C, the lowest since January 5, 1986.</p><p>Cyclone Eloise in Africa</p><p>Cyclone Eloise, the third cyclone to hit the Mozambican coast since 2019, affected more than 250,000 people, displacing at least 18,000 and destroying schools, roads, and other vital infrastructure. It led to at least 27 deaths and damages in Madagascar, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa.</p><p>February</p><p>Polar Vortex in Texas</p><p>Texas was hit by a powerful polar vortex, with record-setting low temperatures that cut state power lines and water systems, leaving millions in the cold.</p><p>Floods in Indonesia's West Java</p><p>Seasonal rains triggered flash floods in Indonesia's West Java island. Rivers swelled. Houses were covered up to 40 to 100 inches of water. Thousands were displaced and left homeless.</p><p>Flooded regions of Acre, Brazil</p><p>Floods inundated several cities in the Amazon rainforest. Local cities and villages were badly hit. Aside from battling Covid-19, the Indigenous populations of the region have had to compromise their diet due to the destruction of their plantations.</p><p>Kenya's locust attacks</p><p>Since 2019, Kenya has experienced unprecedented threats from desert locust invasion linked to climate change. Locust invasions put millions of Kenyans at risk of food and nutrition insecurity. Measures- such as the use of toxic pesticides that have been scientifically proven to cause harm to either the environment, humans or non-target organisms such as bees, fish and ants to control locusts- raise pertinent questions.</p><p>March</p><p>Beijing sandstorm</p><p>Beijing experienced its worst sandstorm in a decade, with the city shrouded in a yellow haze</p><p>Australian floods</p><p>After the worst bushfires in 2020, Australian witnessed devastating floods in many cities this year.</p><p>April</p><p>Forest fires in Nepal</p><p>Firefighters at work to extinguish a forest fire in the Nagarkot area of Bhaktapur District, some 32 km North, east of Kathmandu.</p><p>Floods in Angola</p><p>Flash floods hit the coastal city of Luanda, leaving 14 dead and displacing more than 11,000 people.

The rules contain training and notification requirements and, notably, respirator requirements. The rules apply whenever employees will be exposed to wildfire smoke where the ambient air concentration for fine particulate matter, such as that often produced in forest fire smoke, with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers in size often referred to as PM 2.5, results in an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 101 or above. </p><p><br/><br/>The rules specifically exempt workers in enclosed buildings and structures with mechanically filtered air as long as the employer ensures that all windows and exterior openings are closed except when necessary to enter and exit. Similarly, the rules exempt employees that are in vehicles with a cabin air filter and windows and doors are kept closed except as necessary. However, mass transportation, such as buses and light rails where doors are frequently opened to board and disembark passengers, are not exempt from the rules. <br/><br/>Wildland firefighters, rescue, utilities, communications, and medical operations involved in aiding emergency operations or firefighter operations are exempt from training requirements but are not exempt from notification and exposure control requirements. <br/><br/>The rule covers three areas: training, communicating wildfire smoke hazards, and mitigation measures.  <br/><br/>Training <br/><br/>Beginning August 16, 2021, unless an employer plans to suspend operations whenever the AQI is 101 or above, covered employers must provide training. Training will cover such areas as symptoms and health effects of wildfire smoke exposure, identifying those who might be particularly sensitive, and an employee's right to report exposure without retaliation. Employees must also be trained on the procedures supervisors will follow when an employee exhibits symptoms of wildfire smoke exposure, how employees can get information on ambient air concentration or AQI levels, how to operate and interpret the employer's air quality monitoring devices, the methods to be used to protect employees from wildfire smoke, and the importance, methods, limitations, and benefits of using a filtering facepiece respirator. Training materials are to be available from Oregon OSHA by August 6. <br/><br/>Communication <br/><br/>Employers must develop and implement a system to communicate wildfire smoke hazards to employees. Employees must be notified when poor air quality reaches three different levels: AQI 101, 201, and 501. Employees must also be notified as AQI drops below levels requiring protective measures and encouraged to inform the employer when air quality improves or worsens. <br/><br/>Controlling Exposure <br/><br/>Oregon's temporary rules mandate the provision and, in some circumstances, use of respirators. Whenever the AQI is 101 or above, the employer must be able to provide, at no cost to employees, a sufficient number and variety of sizes of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators to employees wherever they are located and exposed. The respirators must be readily available for voluntary use. For the 2021 wildfire season, KN95 masks will be allowed to substitute for NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators unless the AQI exceeds 501. <br/><br/>Employers must use any engineering or administrative controls possible to reduce exposure below AQI 201 whenever possible. This could be accomplished by providing enclosed buildings, or vehicles with filtered air, relocating work to another location where the air concentration is less than AQI 201 or changing work schedules to seek better air quality. <br/><br/>When employee exposure is at AQI 201or above, even with application of engineering or administrative controls, the employer must ensure employees wear NIOSH-approved respirators. Where the respirators are used exclusively to protect employees from wildfire smoke, the employer does not need to implement a full respiratory protection program and may use the wildfire smoke respiratory protection program described in the appendix to the rules. When the AQI is 501 and NIOSH-approved respirators are necessary, the employer must provide a complete Respiratory Protection Program provided for under OSHA rules. <br/><br/>Bottom Line <br/><br/>There are three main immediate takeaways. First, employers must be ready to begin training on August 16, 2021. Second, employers must establish a plan of communication regarding air quality and gaining access to air quality information before employees are exposed to AQI 101 or above. Lastly, employers will need to have, at a minimum, KN95 masks available for all employees subject to wildfire smoke and, where there is potential for significant poor air quality, NIOSH-approved respirators. <br/><br/>[View source[2].] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/oregon-osha-issues-emergency-heat-safety-rules.html\">https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/oregon-osha-issues-emergency-heat-safety-rules.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/oregon-issues-rules-on-wildfire-smoke-protection.html\">https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/oregon-issues-rules-on-wildfire-smoke-protection.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411162871564806725879100081</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BV-H121-F03R-N3NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 11, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY &amp;

Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Firefighters and volunteers had been engaged overnight in \"hand-to-hand combat, fighting heart and soul\" to erect fire breaks outside villages neighbouring Istiaia, Kontzias said. <br/>The Evia force includes hundreds of firefighters from Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. They were reinforced on Tuesday with units from Cyprus, Slovakia and Poland, the civil protection authority said. <br/>The island is popular with holidaymakers and many Greeks have summer homes in Evia. Some 3,000 people were evacuated by sea this past week as the flames neared. <br/> Fire burns as firefighters struggle to contain Greek fires Photo: AFPTV / Savvas KARMANIOLAS  <br/>In the village of Avgaria, many locals have turned out to help the professionals. <br/>\"If we don't come, who will?\" asked Yiannis, a burly youth in his 20s. \"My aunt's house burned down, that of my grandfather almost did too.\" <br/> The fire on Evia pictured from above Photo: Planet Labs / Handout  <br/>The fire has also wrought havoc on the island's agricultural economy that included resin, olives, figs and honey, leaving many local producers despondent. <br/>\"The first major heatwave exposed the state's nakedness,\" main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras told reporters on Tuesday. <br/>Istiaia Mayor Kontzias said \"mistakes were made and we need to draw lessons from this\". <br/> Map of Greece showing the major fires on the island of Evia. Photo: AFP / Thorsten EBERDING  <br/>\"The Greek state must never forget what happened in northern Evia,\" he added. \"Helicopters helped a lot and if we had done that since the beginning, we would have avoided all this destruction.\" <br/>He was echoing a complaint widely uttered about the lack of air support not just on Evia but throughout Greece. <br/>Many mayors around the country have complained of a serious lack of aerial support in fighting the fires, despite the government's assurances of having set aside ample resources earlier this year. <br/>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis apologised to the nation and vowed to punish those responsible. <br/>\"I apologise for any shortcomings\" in the state response, Mitsotakis said in a televised address on Monday. <br/>\"We may have done what was humanly possible, but in many cases it was not enough.\" <br/>Mitsotakis said more than 580 fires had broken out in recent days around the country, exposing Greece to a \"natural fury without precedent\". <br/>\"Because of the unprecedented heatwave and prolonged drought, (the fires) are hard to extinguish.\" <br/>The PM has pledged hundreds of millions of euros in additional funds for civil protection, reforestation and flood prevention. <br/>He is chairing a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to finalise support measures, and will address the press on Thursday. <br/>There was still concern Tuesday about three separate fires in the Peloponnese peninsula, where villages were still without electricity and water, according to local officials. <br/>More than 400 firefighters were active in that area, including reinforcements from the Czech Republic and Britain. <br/>In the foothills of Mount Parnitha north of Athens, local mayor Spyros Vrettos told ERT that at least 80 homes have been completely destroyed, while some 1,500 electricity pillars in the area will also need to be replaced. <br/>A draft United Nations assessment seen exclusively by AFP has warned the Mediterranean is a \"climate change hotspot\". <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162859954191025879100041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BH-BKY1-JCMN-Y4DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><timeReceived>12:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 10, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Looking forward, the publisher expects the global wireless sensors market to exhibit double-digit growth during the next five years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wireless sensors are standard measurement tools that are equipped with transmitters that can convert signals from process control instruments into a radio transmission. Originally conceptualized for military use, these networks now have wide ranging applications in civilian, industrial, and consumer markets. These extend from preventing trespassing to monitoring building strength and evaluating water quality to measuring individual heart rate.</p><p>Wireless sensors are also used in areas that are difficult to access due to severe environment conditions such as high temperature, pH, pressure, etc. With the help of wireless sensors, operators can constantly supervise processes in extreme environments and report the information back to an operator in a monitoring facility that may be located at a safe distance away. They are also convenient for acquiring data in difficult to access locations. The radio signal is interpreted by a receiver that further converts the wireless signal into a particular, required output, such as an analog current or data analysis via computer software.</p><p>Over the past few years, various new technological advancements have been made on account of which there has been a significant improvement in the overall performance of wireless sensors. This has given a rise to the use of these sensors across numerous end-use industries such as food and beverage, automation, and defence. Wireless sensors are also utilised for various purposes like forest fire detection, water management and flood detection. They are also beneficial for monitoring greenhouse gas emission as well as pest and disease detection. Furthermore, wireless sensors generate a significant quantity of data that can yield actionable insights, catalysing continuous process improvement.</p><p>Implementation at scale, nevertheless, is not without its roadblocks. The development of cost effective, ubiquitous sensor networks primary depends upon the speed and quality of technological advancement, alternate methods of power supply, and the advancement of technical regulations and standards.</p><p>Companies Mentioned</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ABB

Nikos Hardalias said authorities \"truly did what was humanly possible\" against blazes that destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest and hundreds of homes, cost a volunteer firefighter his life, and forced over 60,000 people to flee. Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns. \"We handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we've seen in 40 years,\" Hardalias told a news conference. </p><p>\"Never was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.\" Climate scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events, such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently. Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry, and other nearby nations like Turkey and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires. Worsening drought and heat - both linked to climate change - are also driving wildfires this summer in the U.S. West and in Siberia in northern Russia. In Greece, the worst blaze still burning today was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents. The fire service said 873 firefighters, 50 ground teams and 229 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Poland - part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance. Fourteen helicopters were providing air support today on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was taking place in an area in which villages and forests are entwined. In an afternoon briefing, Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but strong firefighting forces were guarding the perimeter of the fire, particularly around a cluster of villages that are among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it very difficult and dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist the ground forces. According to E.U. wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 121,000 acres has burned up on Evia - by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece. Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered this afternoon. A judicial investigation is unde way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested. \"I don't know whether there is any organized arson plan, that's not my job,\" Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his \"feeling\" that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson. Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes, with some saying not enough were sent early on, leaving the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous. Hardalias argued today that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia - a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years. \"Every house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It's a knife in our heart,\" he said. Asked whether he was satisfied with the country's firefighting response, Hardalias said: \"Obviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.\" \"Whether we could have done something different remains to be seen,\" he said. \"But in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b3057d185a97b3f5fa2f90000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JG-RB21-JBSK-R082-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 10, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Moran. SHAWN EDWARD WILLIAMS, 49, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release for theft of public property and setting timber afire. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle said that \"the consequences of your actions . . . resulted in horrendous consequences to the forests.\"</p><p>According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, lead defendant Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, WILLIAMS joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. WILLIAMS did not himself set the fire, but was present when others set the fire.</p><p>WILLIAMS pleaded guilty in December 2019.</p><p>In their sentencing memo, prosecutors highlighted the danger of Wilke and WILLIAMS's conduct. \"Forest fires present a dire and growing threat in this region. They destroy our forests, poison our air, and endanger responders, local residents, recreationalists, and wildlife. When this fire occurred in early August 2018, the Puget Sound region was (as it is today) already experiencing significant smoke from existing wildfires, and the high risk of fire was evident to everyone in Western Washington. Despite this atmosphere, Williams participated in taking the extreme risk of setting fire to a portion of a treedeep in the forest, in mid-summer. The consequences of that decisionthousands of acres burned, millions of dollars in containment costs, and the release of huge amounts of smokewere easily foreseeable.\"</p><p>The case was investigated by the United States Forest Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123965311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WV-9DM1-JCBF-S1BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"474\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

One project will focus on battling wildfires by using thermal imaging to improve tracking and the second project will study sink holes surrounding Florida's Silver Spring.</p><p>The competitive, merit-based Seed Grants are awarded annually to UNF faculty members to stimulate and \"seed\" the creation of environmentally related research and inspire effective collaboration between faculty and students in diverse disciplines.</p><p>UNF associate professors Drs. John Nuszkowski, mechanical engineering, and Dr. Alan Harris, electrical engineering, were awarded funding provided by the River Branch Foundation for their project on \"Forest Fire Tracking using Machine Learning and Thermal Imaging from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).\"</p><p>Wildfires are devastating due to the environmental concerns from the destruction of land, the significant release of greenhouse gases, and the considerable emission of particulate matter that is concerning to public health. Improvements in wildfire detection, tracking, mitigation, and modeling would lessen the environmental impact from wildfires. The objective of this project is to develop a wildfire tracking algorithm, using machine learning (ML), that is based on thermal imaging captured from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The ML algorithm will be a neural network (NN) model based on object detection for tracking the fire front. Thermal images will be captured by the University's research team's UAV on terrain without a fire, with firepit(s), and with a prescribed burn.</p><p>Dr. Ryan Shamet, UNF civil engineering assistant professor, was awarded funding provided by the Vulcan Materials Company Foundation for his research project on \"Hydrogeological considerations for sinkhole development in the Silver Springs recharge basin in Marion County, Florida.\"</p><p>The Silver Springs state park in Marion County has played a tremendous role in the development of CentralFlorida's national image of beautiful natural resources and unique eco-tourism attractions. However, with an increase in urbanization in the surrounding area, the groundwater emitted from Silver Springs has seen a drastic increase in pollutant concentrations, in turn severely affecting the water quality and ecosystems within the silver river. A major contributing role for the increase in groundwater pollutants is the increase in sinkhole occurrences within the recharge basin for the springs.</p><p>Sinkholes essentially provide a \"direct connect\" to the Floridan aquifer, allowing nutrient-rich surface water to enter the aquifer without any natural filtering or biological degradation processes. This study will investigate the influences of subsurface conditions to sinkhole formation within the area surrounding Silver Springs through implementing soil laboratory testing and numerical modeling. This information will greatly benefit future decision making when designing stormwater management structures (i.e., ponds or roadway swales) to ensure less potential of pollutant groundwater entering the aquifer and deviating Silver Spring's fragile environment.</p><p>The UNF Seed Grant program is supported by an endowment provided by the River Branch Foundation. A recent gift from the Vulcan Materials Company Foundation has allowed the Environmental Center to expand the Seed Grant program and offer two additional grants focused on water issues in Northeast Florida.</p><p>Contact: Amanda Ennis, media relations coordinator, 904/620-2192, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:amanda.ennis@unf.edu\">amanda.ennis@unf.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>C20-RajeshS-7327228 C20-RajeshS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7327228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61J4-MMD1-JC11-13KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><timeReceived>5:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

One project will focus on battling wildfires by using thermal imaging to improve tracking and the second project will study sink holes surrounding Florida's Silver Spring.</p><p>The competitive, merit-based Seed Grants are awarded annually to UNF faculty members to stimulate and \"seed\" the creation of environmentally related research and inspire effective collaboration between faculty and students in diverse disciplines.</p><p>UNF associate professors Drs. John Nuszkowski, mechanical engineering, and Dr. Alan Harris, electrical engineering, were awarded funding provided by the River Branch Foundation for their project on \"Forest Fire Tracking using Machine Learning and Thermal Imaging from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).\"</p><p>Wildfires are devastating due to the environmental concerns from the destruction of land, the significant release of greenhouse gases, and the considerable emission of particulate matter that is concerning to public health. Improvements in wildfire detection, tracking, mitigation, and modeling would lessen the environmental impact from wildfires. The objective of this project is to develop a wildfire tracking algorithm, using machine learning (ML), that is based on thermal imaging captured from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The ML algorithm will be a neural network (NN) model based on object detection for tracking the fire front. Thermal images will be captured by the University's research team's UAV on terrain without a fire, with firepit(s), and with a prescribed burn.</p><p>Dr. Ryan Shamet, UNF civil engineering assistant professor, was awarded funding provided by the Vulcan Materials Company Foundation for his research project on \"Hydrogeological considerations for sinkhole development in the Silver Springs recharge basin in Marion County, Florida.\"</p><p>The Silver Springs state park in Marion County has played a tremendous role in the development of CentralFlorida's national image of beautiful natural resources and unique eco-tourism attractions. However, with an increase in urbanization in the surrounding area, the groundwater emitted from Silver Springs has seen a drastic increase in pollutant concentrations, in turn severely affecting the water quality and ecosystems within the silver river. A major contributing role for the increase in groundwater pollutants is the increase in sinkhole occurrences within the recharge basin for the springs.</p><p>Sinkholes essentially provide a \"direct connect\" to the Floridan aquifer, allowing nutrient-rich surface water to enter the aquifer without any natural filtering or biological degradation processes. This study will investigate the influences of subsurface conditions to sinkhole formation within the area surrounding Silver Springs through implementing soil laboratory testing and numerical modeling. This information will greatly benefit future decision making when designing stormwater management structures (i.e., ponds or roadway swales) to ensure less potential of pollutant groundwater entering the aquifer and deviating Silver Spring's fragile environment.</p><p>The UNF Seed Grant program is supported by an endowment provided by the River Branch Foundation. A recent gift from the Vulcan Materials Company Foundation has allowed the Environmental Center to expand the Seed Grant program and offer two additional grants focused on water issues in Northeast Florida.

'Jurassic World: Dominion' unites the two halves of the saga, as well - with newer characters like Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) partnering up with legacy characters Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Considering that they they are dealing with various ecological disasters, corporate conspiracies and villainous threats, there's enough adventuring to go around. </p><p><br/>But how does the whole thing come together? And where does the movie leave off? Read on to find out. <br/>Major spoilers for 'Jurassic World: Dominion' follow. Return to the mainland if you haven't watched yet; there's a hurricane of unnecessary detail blowing this way! <br/> Also Read: <br/> 'Jurassic World Dominion' Cast and Character Guide (Photos)[2]  <br/><br/>A Plague of Locusts <br/>Just to play a little bit of catch-up here, it's important to know that the main antagonists of 'Jurassic World: Dominion' aren't some rampaging dinosaurs, even though the end of the last movie established the fact that our world is truly Jurassic World. Dinosaurs had escaped from a compound in Northern California and fanned out across the world. They are a part of everyday life now (a quick montage at the beginning showed flying dinosaurs nesting in New York skyscrapers and a hungry aquatic dinosaur munching on a fishing trawler), but they aren't really the focus of 'Jurassic: World Dominion,' aside from a handful of sequences in the movie's first half that includes an exciting, Bourne-inspired Malta chase sequence. <br/>No, the real villain of 'Jurassic World: Dominion' is a swarm of evil locusts. <br/>Yes, you read that right. <br/>A swarm of evil locusts are menacing the entire world in 'Jurassic World: Dominion' and its up to our plucky scientists Grant and Sattler to get to the bottom of it. Their quest leads them to BioSyn, an evil genetic corporation run by Dodgson (played here by Campbell Scott), who fans of 'Jurassic Park' will recognize as the man who sent Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) to his death in the original film (he was also at least partially responsible for everybody else that died after Nedry shut the power down). Dodgson's idea is to charge more for BioSyn crops, which the locusts have been programmed to avoid eating, but the locusts of course get out and are threatening the ecology of the entire planet. <br/>In order to fix the locust problem, Dodgson orders a pair of kidnappings - Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the little clone girl introduced in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' (because her mother had genetic deficiencies that she 'cleansed' while creating Maisie) and Beta, Blue the velociraptor's baby (because Beta has more naturally 'pure' DNA). Why Dodgson and his geneticist, Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong, back again), need both of them is fuzzy at best and why they had to be taken by force is even more tenuous. But, whatever, just go with it. <br/>Owen and Claire, desperate to get their daughter back (the three have been living as a family since the events of the last film) and also reunite Blue with her child, are on one path and Alan, Ellie and Ian are on another path trying to uncover the locust conspiracy. And their stories converge at the elaborate BioSyn corporate campus/nature preserve in the Italian mountains. <br/> Also Read: <br/> Colin Trevorrow Explains How He Crafted 'Jurassic World: Dominion' as Ellie Sattler's Story[3]  <br/><br/>New Park, Same as the Old Park <br/>Towards the middle of the movie and especially into the third act, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' becomes a much more traditional 'Jurassic Park' story. For one, all of the characters are trapped in the BioSyn corporate campus, which is a high tech playground for the genius employees of the company, which is surrounded by a state-of-the-art nature preserve for dinosaurs that BioSyn has located and rehomed. (You can probably guess where this is headed.) <br/>With Dodgson discovering that Ian, Ellie and Alan have figured out his conspiracy, he leaves them to get killed by the dinosaurs in the preserve (including some very spiky sons-of-guns). They're on their own and in the same position they have found themselves in before. Also, Owen and Claire show up there knowing that Maisie and Beta are definitely on the premises. <br/>This time, there are so many dinosaurs - way more than we've ever seen before! - something look like Freddy Kruger with giant nails, one that is furry and red like some evil Elmo and a giant predator that dwarfs the T. Rex and serves as the chief antagonist. (Weirdly, none of these dinosaurs are cooked up in a lab; they all appear as they did in nature. There's no Indominus Rex or Indoraptor, which seems like a weird idea to just completely abandon in the final film.) As is tradition, the dinosaurs occasionally eat people, like the delicious irony of Dodgson getting eaten by the same dinosaur that offed Nedry, as he is attempting to board a high-speed underground train. Crunch! <br/>Another holdover from the original 'Jurassic Park' that gets trotted out again here: the idea that dinosaurs can't be the only threat. There needs to be something oversized and elemental that contributes to the woe of the main characters. In the first movie it was a hurricane that forced most of the staff off the island. Here, it's a more biblical conundrum. When Dodgson discovers that the original characters have uncovered his chicanery, he orders for the locusts (who, we must remember are giant and primordial and very nasty) to be burned alive. <br/>The locusts, not taking too kindly to this development, break out (while still on fire) and head out into the nature preserve. This leads to a massive forest fire that threatens all life on the preserve (and in the corporate campus). BioSyn's grand idea? Just bring the dinosaurs inside. That certainly won't cause any issues. <br/>Universal Pictures<br/>Another Melee (Also Some Off-Camera Congressional Testimony) <br/>With all the dinosaurs and humans now huddled within the glass-and-concrete walls of the BioSyn campus, hell predictably breaks loose. The big toothy predator takes a swing at humans and dinosaurs alike, seemingly killing our beloved T. Rex who, canonically, is the same T. Rex from the very first 'Jurassic Park.' But not so fast! That T. Rex is still alive and now is thirsting for vengeance. It attacks the bigger dinosaur and, in a move that echoes the climax of the first 'Jurassic World,' teams up with another dinosaur. This time he teams up with the Freddy Kruger dinosaur, who uses its big, fabulous claws to impale the bigger dinosaur. It's so refreshing to see two coldblooded reptiles working together to quench their thirst for revenge. <br/>Anyway, Maisie is rescued and Owen and Claire bring Beta back to Blue. Wu releases a better locust that will kill the other locusts, ending that problem very conveniently. And everybody sort of agrees to leave the BioSyn preserve alone; it becomes a more wild sanctuary for the dinosaurs living there, one completely free from human involvement or management. It sort of feels like the end of the third 'Matrix' in that respect; nobody wins or loses and everybody just agrees to try and get along. <br/>We also see that the legacy cast members are going to be testifying before congress on the evils of genetic tampering (generally) and the misdeeds of BioSyn (specifically). Unfortunately, we don't get to see that testimony. <br/>At the very end of 'Jurassic World: Dominion,' nothing has fundamentally changed since the end of 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.' Dinosaurs are still running around and flying and swimming in our world; ecosystems are still in upheaval; and lawmakers and regular citizens have very little clue what to do about any of it. But, at the very least, they don't have to worry about giant evil locusts anymore. <br/> Also Read: <br/> Sam Neill Defends 'Jurassic Park III' and Explains What 'The Bubble' Got Wrong About 'Jurassic World Dominion'[4] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jurassic-world-dominion/\">https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jurassic-world-dominion/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-dominion-cast-characters\">https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-dominion-cast-characters</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-dominion-colin-trevorrow-interview-directors-cut\">https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-dominion-colin-trevorrow-interview-directors-cut</url>/ [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thewrap.com/sam-neill-jurassic-world-dominion-interview-jurassic-park-3\">https://www.thewrap.com/sam-neill-jurassic-world-dominion-interview-jurassic-park-3</url>/ </p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

I was 27 years old,\" Tanzi recalls. \"I remember thinking that for the first time since Dr. Alois Alzheimer described amyloid in 1906, we now have a clue to its origins.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The discoveries never stopped. Scientists around the world have continued to chip away at the genetic underpinning of this heartbreaking disease that steals the mind, leaving the body empty of its former self.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An additional 42 genes connected to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/health/new-alzheimers-genes-wellness/index.html\">development of Alzheimer's disease </url>were discovered in 2022, bringing the total to 75.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>Shortly after that revelation, yet <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35770850/\">another gene called MGMT</url>was identified --<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>and this one might explain why women are two-thirds more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's than men.</p><p>\"It's a female-specific finding -- perhaps one of the strongest associations of a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's in women,\" senior study coauthor Lindsay Farrer, chief of biomedical genetics at Boston University School of Medicine, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/health/female-alzheimer-gene-discovered-wellness-scn/index.html\">told CNN in an earlier interview</url>.</p><p>Many roads lead to Alzheimer's</p><p>With so many genes contributing to the development of Alzheimer's and other types of  dementia, scientists are convinced that each person's journey may be different.</p><p>\"There is a saying: Once you have seen one person with Alzheimer's, you've seen one person with Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine.</p><p>\"Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disease, made up of different pathologies, and each person has their own road. The disease presents differently and progresses differently in different people.\"</p><p>One key genetic pathway is<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet\"> APOE  4</url>, a gene variant responsible for encoding proteins that carry cholesterol in the brain. Having one copy of the gene puts people over the age of 65 in danger, while having two copies is considered the strongest risk factor for the future development of Alzheimer's in that age group.</p><p>But it's not a given. Some people with APOE  4 don't go on to develop Alzheimer's, while others without the gene may find themselves with the hallmark signs of tau tangles and beta amyloid plaques.</p><p>Another pathway to Alzheimer's is inflammation, \"which is common to all chronic disease,\" Farrer said. Several new genes discovered this year appear to play a role in how the body's immune system removes damaged cells from the brain.</p><p>A boost in funding</p><p>To bolster research, federal funding in the United States for Alzheimer's research has increased sevenfold since 2011 to more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://alzfdn.org/federal-fy-22-budget/\">$3.4 billion</url> annually, said Rebecca Edelmayer, senior director of scientific engagement for the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>One focus of research is to find therapeutics that target the immune system as well as inflammation in the brain, Edelmayer said, while other research investigates cell metabolism and how cells use energy.</p><p>Scientists are also trying to understand more about how brain cells are connected and communicate through synapses, and \"we're even seeing investigations that are looking at the gut and brain connection, which is another interesting approach,\" she said.</p><p>Researchers are racing to find breakthroughs in treatment, aided by additional funding in recent years from the public and private sectors, Edelmayer added. The Chicago-based Alzheimer's Association alone is providing over $300 million in funding for more than 920 projects in 45 countries.</p><p>\"We want to focus on strategies that are going to be both culturally appropriate but also effective and scalable around the world,\" Edelmayer said.</p><p>Searching for existing drugs</p><p>Another focus of research is the examination of existing drugs that might prevent Alzheimer's from taking root in the brain.</p><p>In his lab, Harvard's Tanzi uses tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that can develop the typical amyloid plaques and tau tangles of Alzheimer's in just over a month. Tanzi and Harvard cocreators <url normalizedValue=\"https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/25769\">Doo Yeon Kim</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/93062\">Se Hoon Choi</url> published a <url normalizedValue=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307057/\">seminal paper on their discovery in 2014</url>, dubbing it \"Alzheimer's in a dish.\"</p><p>Tanzi and his team have spent seven years testing drugs that the US Food and Drug Administration has already approved on the \"brain\" in the dish. Since the FDA has already verified the safety of those drugs, finding a candidate from that group would accelerate federal approval of the drug for Alzheimer's, thus getting treatments to patients faster, he said.</p><p>Tanzi also tested natural products, such as herbs, spices, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, for their ability to affect the plaques and tangles in his mini-brains creation.</p><p>\"We were able to rapidly screen every approved drug and over 1,000 natural products,\" Tanzi said. \"And now we have over 150 identified drugs and natural products that could be tested in clinical trials to hit plaques, tangles or neuroinflammation.\"</p><p>He and his team at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/mind\">MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease</url> in Boston hope soon to begin clinical trials and collaborate with other scientists to see which of the potential candidates can deliver results.</p><p>\"It's all about hitting the right person with the right drug, at the right time in the course of their disease,\" he told CNN.</p><p>\"Many people may not know this, but after 40 years old, just about all of us start to build up the initiating pathology of Alzheimer's, which is amyloid plaque in the brain and the neurofibrillary tangles,\" he continued. \"It's part of life, just like most of us begin to build up a little bit of plaque in our arteries from cholesterol.\"</p><p>In fact, Tanzi estimates some 30 million to 40 million Americans have enough amyloid in their brains right now to benefit from a drug to lower it -- if science had the ability to do so safely and affordably.</p><p>\"I like to say the amyloid is like the match, and the tangles are like brush fires that propagate and spread over decades,\" Tanzi said. \"And along the way you're triggering big forest fires, that's neuroinflammation.\"</p><p>By the time a person shows any signs of cognitive decline, he added, \"the forest fire of neuroinflammation is blazing,\" and it's too late to rescue the brain significantly and improve thinking and memory skills.</p><p>\"The elephant in the room is that we wait until the brain deteriorates to the point of dysfunction before we treat this disease,\" Tanzi said. \"That's like saying wait until you lose half of the beta cells in your pancreas before we diagnose diabetes.\"</p><p>One of the reasons clinical drug trials over the last few decades <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/25/health/alzheimers-dementia-drug-ban2401-biogen-eisai-study/index.html\">failed to control amyloid buildup</url> was because many of the study participants were in more advanced stages of the disease when \"too much of destruction had been done,\" Edelmayer said.</p><p>\"Removing amyloid at that time wasn't necessarily helpful,\" she said. \"It has taken us some time to truly understand at what point in the disease process do we need to specifically target amyloid with drugs.\"</p><p>Case in point: The controversial<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/health/alzheimers-drug-trial-failure-aducanumab-bn/index.html\"> amyloid-removing drug aducanumab</url>, which sold under the brand name Aduhelm,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>was only tested on people with mild cognitive impairment. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/health/alzheimers-drug-aducanumab-fda-approved-wellness/index.html\">FDA approved the use of aducanumab in 2021</url> despite the fact that all but one member of an independent expert panel charged with reviewing the drug's effectiveness<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/06/health/aducanumab-alzheimers-disease-fda-advisory-vote-bn/index.html\"> voted against approving it</url>.</p><p>While aducanumab did remove amyloid, the clinical trial only showed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/health/biogen-alzheimers-drug-fda/index.html\">small improvement in cognition</url> in one subset of patients. Some <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/17/opinions/biogen-alzheimers-drug-opinion-ramachandra-ross/index.html\">doctors</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/what-you-need-know-about-aducanumab\">medical institutions</url> around the country decided not to offer<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/health/aducanumab-questions-answered-wellness/index.html\"> aducanumab </url>to their patients after balancing the drug's weak performance with cost and significant side effects.</p><p>In April, Medicare announced it would only cover the drug's cost of $56,000 a year if the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-medicare-coverage-policy-monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment\">person was enrolled in a study</url> approved by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>In the same month, Biogen, the company that developed the drug, <url normalizedValue=\"https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/update-regulatory-submission-aducanumab-european-union-0\">gave up </url>on getting the drug's approval in the European Union. By May, the company announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://investors.biogen.com/static-files/dff56e1a-1959-489c-8012-c1143bde8e73\">stop supporting the drug</url>.</p><p>\"I want to make it clear to people that to end Alzheimer's, we need early detection, early intervention some 10, 20 years before symptoms show up,\" Tanzi said. \"And what about the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/Alz-Greater-Risk.html#:~:text=Alzheimer's%20disease%20is%20the%20most,65%20with%20younger%2Donset%20Alzheimer's.\">6 million people</url> in this country with this disease right now? For them, we need to put out the fire, stop the neuroinflammation, stop the killing of neurons.\"</p><p>Lifestyle interventions</p><p>Screening tools for Alzheimer's would speed up research and assist clinicians in finding cases of Alzheimer's at an earlier stage. However, most current tests are invasive, such as spinal taps, or enormously expensive, such as positron emission tomography, or PET scans, which insurance companies often refuse to cover.</p><p>\"In the end, we need screening tools that are going to be scalable, not invasive, and certainly something that is cost-effective for patients and their families,\" Edelmayer said. \"A blood test really is the holy grail if we can get there. We're not there yet, but we're getting closer. Ask me in another two years.\"</p><p>Preventive methods are a key focus of much of today's research. Lifestyle changes such as improving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/health/exercise-brain-health-protein-study-wellness/index.html\">exercise</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/05/health/mediterranean-diet-memory-loss-dementia-wellness/index.html\">eating </url>a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/health/mediterranean-diet-cognitive-impairment-wellness/index.html\">plant-based diet</url>, addressing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/health/sleep-dementia-risk-study-wellness/index.html\">sleep deficits</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://syvnews.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/want-to-live-longer-be-an-optimist-study-says/collection_b0d8211f-e45f-5a87-9fe2-a35ed0a6b4ec.html\">reducing stress</url>, improving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/health/personality-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html\">social connections</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/health/elderly-zoom-dementia-pandemic-scli-scn-intl/index.html\">engagement</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/health/wordle-brain-games-wellness/index.html\">some types</url> of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/health/brain-training-exercises/index.html\">cognitive training</url> are all showing impressive results for people early in the disease process.

Even people who carried the Alzheimer's gene APOE  4, which raises risk for late-life dementia, saw benefits in cognition, he said.</p><p>More than 25 countries are running similar multidomain lifestyle interventions as part of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alz.org/wwfingers/overview.asp\">World Wide FINGER network</url>, Edelmayer said. FINGER stands for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/research-and-development/research-and-projects/finger-research-project\">Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</url>. People who participated improved their cognition by 25% over two years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/research-and-development/research-and-projects/finger-research-project/results\">according to the study</url>.</p><p>\"I am very cautious to use words like cure,\" Isaacson said. \"But when we use all of these various tools early, during the years of pre-dementia, I think prevention is a cure. And hopefully risk reduction can delay pathology long enough so that the person will pass away from something else before they ever develop dementia.\"</p><p>All these research approaches are \"bringing us to the threshold of a transformational new era in Alzheimer's research,\" Edelmayer said. \"It's just time right now that we're up against, especially for those currently living with the disease.\"         </p><p>             By Sandee LaMotte, CNN</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Smith, Board Chairman</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three weeks before I was born on August 5, 1949, 15 brave men known as \"smokejumpers\" boarded an airplane in Missoula, Montana, to head to a forest fire near Mann Gulch for what they termed a \"10 o'clock fire.\" That was one they would extinguish by 10 a.m. the next day. After parachuting in with full gear, the group met up with a forest ranger named Wagoner Dodge, who would lead the charge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The small forest fire rapidly underwent a \"blowup,\" exploding across the gulch and quickly progressing up the steep hill--a condition with which the smokejumpers had no experience. It was estimated that 30-foot flames were fanned by winds of 87 miles per hour propelling the flames at a rate of almost 660 feet per minute.</p><p>Wag Dodge started a fire in advance of the men and yelled for them to drop their gear and follow him. Two men heeded, running to a crevice in a rock where they ultimately survived. Dodge lay in the burnt out grass and the fire burned around him leaving him without a single burn or singed hair. Sadly, the remaining 13 men panicked; they could not see the logic in dropping the much-trusted implements of their trade--items that were part and parcel of who they were as firefighters. Within two hours of landing, these brave men had lost their lives.</p><p>This tragedy offers a cautionary tale for universities and their governing boards--and really any organization--seeking to survive in today's uncharted territory. The natural inclination to cling to familiar and historically defined ways of doing business will likely prove ineffective in our current pandemic reality. Crisis events can often be an unexpected catalyst, not only for compelling an abrupt narrowing and refocusing of priorities, but also for reimagining how to get business done.</p><p>The smokejumpers didn't trust the leadership and ingenuity of Wag, and the vast majority perished. Extensive study of the Mann Gulch tragedy led to changes in firefighting and increased safety training. Thomas McLean wrote a book about the fire, a movie was made, and songs were written, but the lessons of the tragedy were not fully learned.</p><p>Nearly 50 years later, in four separate fires during the 1990s, 23 other firefighters lost their lives as they refused to drop their equipment and flee. One man remembers running and thinking after nearing the ridge that he still had his chainsaw in his hand but was more concerned with where he could lay it down to prevent it from getting burned than with escaping. When he did drop the saw, he said he felt like he was doing something unnatural or wrong.</p><p>Psychologist Karl Weick studied these examples in 2001 and found that they and other tragic accidents serve as a metaphor for how organizations can sometimes react and respond to unusual and challenging circumstances. The tools and equipment used at Mann Gulch were emblematic of who the firefighters were, as well as what they did. When presented with situations they had never experienced, the idea of abandoning the tools that defined their identity became unthinkable and represented a lack of flexibility and adaptation. Through analysis of these and other tragedies, such as the Challenger shuttle disaster, Weick concluded that people under unusual stress in inordinate situations will regress to what they know best--and often to what have become obsolete tools they are accustomed to using.</p><p>Like most colleges and universities, Kansas City University (KCU) had to react and respond quickly to the COVID-19 crisis by closing campuses and moving immediately to a full online curriculum in order to protect the health and safety of our campus communities while ensuring students could complete their studies for the semester and the class of 2020 was able to graduate. At KCU, the pandemic not only led to wholesale changes in the delivery of education and campus operations but also redefined how we work with our board.</p><p>Letting go of established norms and familiar \"equipment\" resulted in changes in three key areas: communication, meeting format and logistics, and follow-up analysis of the changes made. Our first board meeting during the pandemic yielded 100 percent attendance, which was an increase over prior meetings. A few highlights that helped make our retooled approach a success follow.</p><p>Communication</p><p>* All board members were added to the group emails from the CEO, COO, provost, and deans to stay abreast of how our stakeholders were being kept informed and what was being communicated.</p><p>* The Executive Committee scheduled monthly meetings rather than on an as-needed basis to keep members updated; all board members were invited.</p><p>* All committee meetings moved to a video conference format.</p><p>* Greater emphasis was placed on the use of online board documents.</p><p>* New member orientation and onboarding were moved to an online format.</p><p>Meeting Format and Logistics</p><p>* Staff, leadership, and trustees participated in a virtual prep meeting to finalize the agenda and discuss logistics.</p><p>* Group text chat was set up for staff and board leadership to allow rapid communication during the meeting.</p><p>* IT personnel contacted all board members in the week prior to the meeting to minimize technology problems the day of the meeting.</p><p>* In lieu of the traditional board dinner held the evening prior to the meeting, a virtual pre-meeting reception welcomed members for social time and camaraderie.</p><p>* The meeting was condensed to a one-day video format rather than the usual two-day live format to reduce screen fatigue.</p><p>* Two weeks prior to the board meeting, additional material was provided to trustees to shorten the full board meeting by reducing duplication.</p><p>* The board met in closed session at the beginning of the meeting to prioritize updates and address pressing issues that required sensitive discussion.</p><p>* Copies of audiovisual materials shown by screen sharing were also duplicated in the online board book.</p><p>* A survey was linked to the online board material to assess members' impressions of the changes and to drive improvements of the meeting format for the future.</p><p>Post-Meeting Analysis</p><p>* A video conference was held 48 hours after the close of the meeting with board leadership and staff to assess the technical aspects of what worked well and what needed improvement.</p><p>* Results of the online survey were tabulated and discussed and will be used with future board meetings to continue to improve the delivery of the content and the function of the meeting.</p><p>In extraordinary times, under unprecedented circumstances--when the way we used to do it doesn't work--we must let go of some of the tools that have defined us. We must react quickly, be able to improvise, become more flexible, and adapt. We must accelerate learning, acknowledging that both wisdom and ignorance increase together. As we know more, we have to recognize how much more there is that we don't know.</p><p>I am proud to say that KCU has met the early challenges of a global pandemic and its disruption of the normal processes of higher education. But it is not a \"10 o'clock fire\" that is being fought. With continued resilience and adaptability, wisdom, respectful dialog, and meaningful communication at all levels of the organization, we stand ready to encounter each new day, working toward and anticipating a better tomorrow.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7287078 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7287078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6170-J6N1-DYG2-R1SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 4, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001911</classCode><className>PHARMACEUTICALS &amp; BIOTECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX609</classCode><className>KANSAS CITY, MO, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D1WX</classCode><className>MISSOULA, MT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS142</classCode><className>MONTANA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS141</classCode><className>MISSOURI, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Many locations broke all-time maximum temperature records by more than 5 \u00b0C, and the Canadian national temperature record was broken by 4.6 \u00b0C, with a new record temperature of 49.6 \u00b0C. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of this event and its impacts. Upstream diabatic heating played a key role in the magnitude of this anomaly. Weather forecasts provided advanced notice of the event, while sub-seasonal forecasts showed an increased likelihood of a heat extreme with lead times of 10-20 days. The impacts of this event were catastrophic, including hundreds of attributable deaths across the Pacific Northwest, mass-mortalities of marine life, reduced crop and fruit yields, river flooding from rapid snow and glacier melt, and a substantial increase in wildfires\u2014the latter contributing to landslides in the months following. These impacts provide examples we can learn from and a vivid depiction of how climate change can be so devastating.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2021 unprecedented Pacific Northwest heatwave broke temperature records by extraordinary amounts. Impacts included hundreds of deaths, mass-mortalities of marine life, increased wildfires, reduced crop and fruit yields, and river flooding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>An unprecedented heatwave occurred in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) from ~25 June to 2 July 2021, over lands colonially named British Columbia (BC) and Alberta (AB) in Canada, Washington (WA), and Oregon (OR) in the United States. Near-surface air temperature anomalies reached up to 16\u201320 \u00b0C above normal over a wide region (Fig. 1), with many locations breaking all-time maximum temperature records by more than 5 \u00b0C (Fig. 2a). The Canadian national temperature record was broken 3 days in a row, at multiple locations, with the highest temperature of 49.6 \u00b0C recorded in Lytton, BC, on 29 June (Figs. 1b), 4.6 \u00b0C higher than the Canadian record prior to this event. Lytton, a small town in an arid mountain valley just north of 50\u00b0N in the lee of the BC Coast Range (shown by the red triangle in Fig. 1a), is located on Lytton First Nation reserves, at the site of the Indigenous village of Kumsheen on the traditional lands of the Nlaka\u2019pamux people. On 30 June 2021, much of Lytton was tragically destroyed by a wildfire. The new record temperature was reportedly the hottest worldwide temperature recorded north of 45\u00b0 latitude, and hotter than any recorded temperature in Europe or South America1. The amount by which previous all-time records were broken was extraordinary when compared with the infamous heatwaves in Europe in August 2003 and Russia in July\u2013August 2010 (Fig. 2), both of which killed 10,000 s of people2,3. Notably, whilst the record exceedance was much higher for this PNW heatwave, and the maximum anomalies in standard deviations were also higher4, the June 2021 PNW heatwave was shorter in duration than these previous two heatwaves.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">June 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave temperatures.</emphasis></p><p>Heatwave daily maximum near-surface (2 m) temperatures (TX). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> ERA5 reanalysis data maximum 3-day running mean (between 23 June and 02 July 2021) of TX anomalies relative to a daily 1981\u20132020 climatology (see Methods for more details). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Absolute TX values for 2021 (solid) and 1981\u20132020 climatology (dashed); black lines: spatial average of ERA5 data over the black box in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, with shading \u00b11, 2, and 3 standard deviations; red lines: observations from Lytton, British Columbia (BC), denoted by the red triangle in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2014missing values from 1 to 5 July are likely due to the wildfire.

Mean sea-level pressure, 700 hPa relative humidity and 250 hPa winds from 21 June to 26 June are shown in Fig. 3. From 19\u201321 June a low-pressure system intensified southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula of eastern Russia (Fig. 3a, low centered at 50\u00b0N, 172\u00b0E); the associated northerly winds transported cold air southward over the northwest Pacific Ocean. Concurrently, southwesterly flow along and within a frontal zone (denoted by high relative humidity values in Fig. 3a) associated with a weak embedded low-pressure east of Japan brought a warm, moist air mass northward into the same region. The juxtaposition of these two air masses created a strong temperature gradient, supporting the formation of a strong (&gt;90 ms\u22121 at the 250 hPa level) west-east oriented jet over the western Pacific (Fig. 3a), which propagated eastward into the central Pacific (Fig. 3b). Another weak low developed along the frontal zone east of Japan from 22 to 24 June (Fig. 3c, low centered at 39 N, 157E). Southerly flow ahead of lows and frontal zones, as well as diabatic (condensational) heating within clouds in frontal zones typically contribute to low-level warming downstream of such features, known to be associated with building high-pressure ridges. By 24 June, ridging had developed within the jet downstream of both lows (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Meteorological conditions leading up to heatwave onset.</emphasis></p><p>Meteorological conditions over the North Pacific for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> 00UTC 21 June, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> 00UTC 23 June, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> 12UTC 24 June, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> 12UTC 26 June. Data from ERA5 reanalysis showing: mean sea-level pressure (MSLP; contoured, hPa), 700 hPa relative humidity (RH; shaded, light blue &gt;70%, dark blue &gt;90%), and 250 hPa wind vectors (ms\u22121, colored by wind speed). Coastlines and country borders are shown in green to distinguish them from the MSLP contours.</p><p>From 23 to 24 June the upper-level wave (from Fig. 3b) transited the Pacific, deepening the central Pacific upper-level low (or trough) and maintaining a long frontal zone extending equatorward of this low (Fig. 3c). South-southwesterly flow ahead of and within this frontal zone, and diabatic heating within it, brought warmer air into the eastern Pacific, building high pressure ridging over the eastern Pacific (Fig. 3c)\u2014the high-amplitude ridge associated with this unprecedented heatwave. This frontal zone persisted (Fig. 3d), gradually weakening into 28 June, while continuing to supply diabatic heating and southerly flow to maintain the downstream ridge. Quasi-stationary high-pressure ridges such as this are also known as blocking highs or atmospheric blocking.</p><p>Four-day backwards air parcel trajectories from GFS forecast data produced using the NOAA HYSPLIT model5 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S1) reveal that the low-level air mass over the PNW heatwave region warmed because of: (1) upstream diabatic heating within frontal zones over the eastern Pacific on 24 and early on 25 June, and within orographic clouds over the Alaska Panhandle late on 25 June (presumably predominantly condensational heating), (2) adiabatic warming as it subsided under strong high-pressure ridging, and (3) diabatic heating over the land region under clear sky conditions (presumably predominantly shortwave radiative forcing6 and entrainment/mixing); the heatwave occurred notably close to the summer solstice when insolation is maximum in the Northern hemisphere. Analysis of 63 trajectories shows that ~78% (~14 K) of the net temperature change of the trajectory parcels over the 4 days resulted from diabatic processes, while ~22% (~4 K) was due to adiabatic processes associated with net subsidence (see Methods). This analysis uses forecast data, not observations or reanalysis; however, in the next section, we show that near-term forecasts of this event were good, albeit underestimating the magnitude of the maximum temperatures.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Back-trajectories for Near-surface Heatwave Air.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Nine representative four-day backward trajectories terminating at 500 m above ground level (AGL) within the strongest heat anomaly (boxed area in Fig. 1a). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Potential temperature of parcels along the trajectory, time from right to left.

Trajectories were computed and plotted using GFS 0.25\u00b0 forecast data and the NOAA HYSPLIT model.</p><p>Other studies also provide evidence that sensible heating, mixing, and subsidence played significant roles in locally heating the low-level air mass of this heatwave7\u20139. Neal et al.8 emphasized the influence of diabatic heating on the formation of the blocking high pattern, but did not quantify this effect\u2014our trajectories provide a quantitative estimate of the importance of this role, and corroborate their findings on diabatic and adiabatic processes. Soil moisture feedbacks likely also played a role in the high temperatures of this unprecedented heatwave9,10.</p><p>Lytton, which recorded the heatwave\u2019s hottest temperature, lies within an arid, steep, rocky canyon. The aridity means that a relatively small portion of incoming solar radiation goes into latent heating, leading to a relatively larger magnitude of sensible heating. This heating was compounded over multiple days; factors contributing to limited overnight cooling may have included (1) the thermal inertia of the rocky terrain, and (2) the steep canyon walls creating a smaller sky view factor, limiting longwave radiation loss to space. For coastal population centers (e.g., Vancouver, BC; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon), a coastal thermal trough11 enhanced the coastal pressure gradient, bringing so-called \u201coutflow\u201d winds from the interior to the coast. These may have provided additional warming because (1) hotter air from the interior was transported to the coast, and (2) adiabatic warming occurred as the air traveled from higher interior elevations towards the lower-elevation coastal regions.</p><p>This event was widely described in the media as a \u201cheat dome\u201d, wherein subsidence/adiabatic warming, \u201ctrapped air\u201d, and sensible heating are the dominant mechanisms driving the anomalous heat. This conceptual model ignores the role of upstream diabatic heating, which our analysis shows is a significant heat source. This \u201cheat dome\u201d phrase is not a common phrase within the scientific community; a search indicates the phrase has only been used by nine papers in the American Meteorological Society database (and most of these refer to \u201curban heat domes,\u201d not a synoptic scale feature). We, therefore, refer to this event as a \u201cblocking high\u201d, \u201cheatwave\u201d, or \u201cheat emergency\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forecasts</emphasis></p><p>We consider the evolution of an operational weather forecast for this event during the 8 days prior to the heatwave onset on 25 June (heatwave timing is shown in Fig. 1b), and provide an operational meteorologist\u2019s perspective with respect to the interpretation and communication of the forecasts. We focus on forecast data from the 42-member North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS)12, which is a combination of the Canadian Ensemble Forecast System (CEFS)13 and U.S. Global Ensemble Forecasting System14,15. We also include a comparison of deterministic forecasts from the Canadian Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)16 and the U.S. Global Forecast System (GFS) v1617. The NAEFS forecasts presented here underwent bias correction and probabilistic calibration (similar to the methods described in Bourdin et al.18) as part of an operational forecast. These data are presented as an example of the type of information and skill forecasters can obtain from a typical modern medium-range operational forecast system for such an extreme event as this, but it is not our intent to provide a full evaluation of this forecast system; such an evaluation is provided for the ECMWF forecast by Emerton et al.19. More details on ensemble forecasting are provided in the Methods section.</p><p>On 18 June, 8 days before heatwave onset on 25 June (forecast terminology counts 18 June as day 1) and 12 days before temperatures peaked on 29 June (see Fig. 1b), the ensemble forecast gave its first indication of a heatwave. Long-lead-time ensemble-average forecasts of extreme events are moderated by the divergent scenarios of the ensemble members (however, lower-probability more-extreme scenarios are also considered). Given the known lower forecast skill at longer horizons, and the moderate heatwave forecast by the ensemble-average, meteorologists communicated that a heatwave was likely for the following weekend.</p><p>By 21 June, 5 days before onset and 9 days before peak temperatures, the forecast ensemble clearly indicated an extreme heatwave, with high confidence that temperatures would exceed the 95th percentile of the climatological distribution for several days (see Supplementary Fig. S2). From experience forecasters knew this meant daily records would likely be broken (hottest temperature recorded for a given calendar day), and all-time records (hottest temperature recorded on any day) looked possible. Deterministic forecasts from 21 June also indicated extreme temperatures (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S2); however, forecasters are less likely to trust such single model forecasts at long forecast horizons, especially when they indicate extreme events, as they are more prone to false alarms. Meteorologists are typically reluctant to make extreme weather forecasts at forecast horizons of around a week for fear of \u201ccrying wolf\u201d and the associated reduction in end-user trust. In this case, however, the ensemble forecast provided sufficient certainty that meteorologists were able to warn of \u201cextreme\u201d heat at this relatively long-lead time\u2014a testament to ensemble forecast technology.</p><p>From 23 to 25 June, the forecasted \u201cmost likely\u201d temperatures continued to increase, as well as the longevity of the heatwave, particularly for interior BC (see lower panel in Supplementary Fig. S2, showing forecasts initialized on 24 June). Meteorologists communicated certainty about all-time records being broken, and warned about potential impacts, demonstrating that the forecasts were able to capture the unprecedented nature of this event. By the onset of the heatwave on 25 June (5 days before it peaked), forecasts of the magnitude and longevity of the event were very good; although forecasted high-temperature records fell 1\u20133 \u00b0C short of the observed highs in many cases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Subseasonal forecasts</emphasis></p><p>The ability to forecast extreme events at longer lead times can significantly enhance early warning and preparation systems. Subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts fill the gap between the short to medium-range weather forecasts discussed in the previous section, and seasonal forecasts (3 months lead time and beyond). We analyze the prediction of this heatwave event using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational S2S forecasts. We look for prediction of temperatures or frequency of atmospheric blocking above the 95th percentile (referred to as \u2018extreme\u2019 in the following text), as no ensemble members of any S2S forecasts predicted temperatures as extreme as those observed for initializations earlier than 17 June20.</p><p>Figure 5 demonstrates that forecasts initialized from 10 June onwards showed an increased probability of extreme temperatures from 25 June\u20131 July, a lead time consistent with earlier studies for this20 and other21 heatwaves. From 14 June, up to 70% of ensemble members forecasted extreme temperatures somewhere within the affected region, with the predicted location improving with shorter lead times. An increased probability of extreme blocking was seen in forecasts at lead times as early as 7 June. This is not associated with a large increase in the probability of extreme temperatures over the affected region, likely due to errors in forecasted block location placing the block too far west over the ocean. For forecasts initialized on 3\u201310 June, a higher probability of extreme temperature anomalies was predicted to the east of the heatwave region, consistent with a widespread soil moisture deficit across this region at the time (see Supplementary Figure S3).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Subseasonal forecasts of extreme temperature and atmospheric blocking.</emphasis></p><p>Fraction of ensemble members that predicted 2 m temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and number of blocked days (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">j</emphasis>) greater than the 95th percentile of the respective climatologies during 25 June to 1 July.

Gray contours show the observed location of the heatwave based on ERA5 2 m temperature data.</p><p>Interestingly, a stronger forecast in terms of both temperature and blocking frequency was seen for forecasts initialized on 14 June relative to forecasts initialized on 17 June (Fig. 5d, e, i, j). Similar behavior has been seen in other heatwave forecasts at longer lead times21. The location of the extreme temperature anomalies and blocking did, however, improve with decreasing lead time, with the 14 June forecasts typically placing the block too far to the west over the ocean (Fig. 5i).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change context</emphasis></p><p>\u201cWhat was the role of anthropogenic climate change in this event?\u201d is one of the first questions asked by the public and policy-makers alike. Despite recent progress in extreme event attribution science22, this is a difficult question to answer for extremely rare events. One common approach is to quantify the change in the return period of an event; however, the validity of this method is uncertain for events this rare23\u201325. Of the papers published on this event thus far, estimates of the current return period of this event vary from 1 in 10,000\u2013100,000 years24, 1 in 1000 years25, to 1 in 200 years;10 further research on methods to estimate the expected occurrence of such unprecedented extremes in the context of a limited observational record and a changing climate are critically needed.</p><p>It is clear, however, that anthropogenic warming of the planet contributed to the severity of this event23,25,26\u2014mean global temperatures for 2010\u20132019 were around 1.1 \u00b0C warmer than in 1850\u20131900, with the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) attributing this increase entirely to human activities27. Land temperatures have warmed faster than the global mean (1.5 \u00b0C since 1850\u20131900), and the rate of warming has increased over the past 70 years27, increasing the probability of record-shattering extremes28. Regionally, this PNW heatwave occurred in a background summer climate that was ~1.0 \u00b0C warmer than at the end of the 19th century (see Methods), although changes in extremes do not necessarily mirror changes in the mean temperature29.</p><p>This heatwave broke many records by substantially more than the observed change in mean summer temperature of 1.0 \u00b0C (see Fig. 2). Whilst this is at least partially due to internal (i.e. unforced) variability of the climate system, the question remains whether there was a dynamical impact of climate change in addition to the thermodynamic impact of increasing mean temperatures. The concerning possibility is that anthropogenic climate change may have made the atmospheric circulation patterns that led to this event stronger or more likely. This is an area of ongoing research, with many possible mechanisms to be explored and understood30 and we are still far from a full understanding and community consensus.</p><p>One proposed hypothesis that has garnered a lot of attention, including in the media, is that Arctic amplification (AA), by reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, reduces the strength of the mid-latitude atmospheric jetstream, which may lead to amplified mid-latitude atmospheric waves associated with heatwaves31. There is still substantial disagreement in the scientific community regarding this hypothesis however32,33. One recent study suggests that regional sea-ice loss may contribute to increased heatwave frequency in this Western North America region34. To investigate if surface AA-induced changes to atmospheric dynamics may have increased the probability of this heatwave, we perform analysis using two metrics of atmospheric waviness, including a proxy for atmospheric blocking (see Methods) on two simulations from the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP)35. The PAMIP simulations have been shown to simulate a weakening of the high-latitude jet in response to AA;36 however, we find no evidence for robust changes in waviness over North America in response to sea-ice loss or sea surface temperature changes in the two PAMIP models (those with available daily data; see Methods). The lack of changes seen in our analysis should not be taken as conclusive evidence that AA did not contribute dynamically to this event. A more complete analysis of the role of AA, including using additional metrics associated with heat extremes and investigation into the role of the depth or localization of the AA, is required to fully answer this question.</p><p>Other potential mechanisms for how climate change may have influenced this event through impacts on atmospheric circulation include changes in: soil moisture affecting extratropical Rossby wave sources37 and land-atmosphere feedbacks on the development of atmospheric blocks10,38,39; tropical Rossby wave sources from changing tropical convection40; and Rossby wave propagation30, including changes in atmospheric waveguide conditions that may lead to enhanced amplification of stationary waves41. In the Synoptic Conditions section, we highlight the important role of diabatic heating within upstream frontal zones for the development of the atmospheric block critical to this heatwave, consistent with other recent studies on atmospheric blocking42. Given increases in atmospheric water vapor content in a warmer world43,44, this impact of climate change may influence the strength and development of blocking highs, and the near-surface temperature anomalies within them. Mo et al. (2022)45 suggest that water vapor and sensible heat transported within an upstream atmospheric river prior to this heatwave may have played a role in the extreme temperatures, adding another mechanism through which climate change may impact heatwaves. With so many potential mechanisms, understanding the role of climate change on the atmospheric dynamics associated with heatwaves is understandably difficult; however, the impacts of this unprecedented event, summarized in the remainder of this paper, illustrate the importance of this research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impacts</emphasis></p><p>The impacts of this unprecedented heatwave were felt across many spheres of our ecosystem. Whilst the extremely high temperatures lasted for around a week (Fig. 1b), some impacts continued long after. We provide an analysis of a number of these impacts, in chronological order. We start with those felt mostly during the heatwave, including human health impacts and coastal marine die-offs. Next, we consider impacts that were initiated during the heatwave but continued to be felt for weeks to months after, including wildfires, agricultural yield declines, and glacier/snow melt. Finally, we end with the landslides that occurred throughout the summer and fall of 2021, influenced by cascading effects initiated by the heatwave.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human health</emphasis></p><p>Heatwaves can have catastrophic impacts on human health. Substantial increases in death rates have been documented during and immediately following past heatwaves, such as those occurring in Chicago in 199546, western Europe in 200347, and Moscow in 20103. During this 2021 PNW heatwave, increased mortality was reported in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and the US states of Washington, and Oregon. Here we report data from the most recent reports, from governmental sources where available (see Methods for more details on data sources and reporting). Whilst estimates of the total number of deaths due to this heatwave are likely to change over time as the event receives further study, the evidence suggests that the death toll has little precedent in the affected regions, particularly BC.</p><p>Between 25 June and 2 July, an estimated 740 excess deaths in the province of BC were observed48, a 95% increase in population mortality over an 8-day period. Thus far, the BC Coroners Service has attributed 619 deaths to the extreme heatwave event, with most (93%) of these deaths occurring between 25 June and 1 July49. In other regions, reports indicate at least 66 attributable deaths in Alberta50, 100 heat-related deaths in Washington State51, and 83 heat-related deaths in Oregon State52, giving a total preliminary estimate of at least 868 deaths across the PNW that have been attributed to this heatwave.</p><p>Most deaths during the heatwave occurred in private residences49,51, likely due to dangerously high indoor temperatures53. Initial analyses of the community deaths in metropolitan Vancouver (the largest city in BC) found that they were disproportionately in neighborhoods with higher material and social deprivation and lower levels of green space53, with higher risk among those aged 65\u201384 years and among females. Different analyses from the BC Coroners Service also document that severe mental illness and substance use disorder were significant risk factors49. Further analyses are needed to account for both of these interrelated factors.</p><p>Serious but non-fatal health impacts also occurred. From 25 to 30 June the average daily number of emergency department visits for heat-related illnesses in the US Health and Human Services Region 10 (which includes the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska) was 69 times higher in 2021 than during the equivalent days in 2019, with disproportionate impacts on males and persons aged 75 and older54. In Canada, WorkSafe BC, an agency dedicated to promoting safe and healthy workplaces across the BC province, advised employers to consider workplace closures during the extreme heat event if they did not have air conditioning, and numerous businesses, particularly restaurants, followed this advice.</p><p>From a public health perspective, it is important to reflect on the fact that the heatwave occurred after 18 months of a global pandemic. Social isolation is a known risk factor for heat-related deaths55,56, and there is ample evidence that social isolation increased drastically during the pandemic, especially among older adults57. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic response likely primed the most at-risk population to be particularly susceptible to this extreme heat event. Public use of interventions such as cooling centers may have been reduced due to perceived COVID-19 risk, in addition to the pandemic response and concerns around COVID-19 creating issues with staffing such interventions49.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marine life</emphasis></p><p>Rocky intertidal shores are some of the most physically stressful habitats on Earth, and many of the species that occupy them often live very close to their physiological tolerance limits58. Intertidal ecosystems are therefore often used as bellwethers for the ecological effects of climate change and extreme weather events59. Plants and animals that live in the intertidal zone are especially susceptible to extremely high temperatures during daytime low tides, when solar radiation can raise organismal body temperatures well above air temperature59,60. The hottest days of the 2021 heatwave coincided with very low, early afternoon low tides throughout most of the Salish Sea (the inland waters of BC and Washington State). As a result, surface temperatures in excess of 50 \u00b0C were observed in the intertidal zone (Fig. 6a, b), particularly on gently sloping south and west-facing surfaces that received the most direct solar radiation.Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heatwave impacts on marine life.</emphasis></p><p>Thermal images showing extreme high surface temperatures during low tide on 28 June, 2021, on <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> a rocky intertidal shoreline and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> within a mussel bed.

A subset of species impacted by the heatwave are shown in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> bay mussels, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mytilus trossulus</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Pacific oysters, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Magallana (= Crassostrea) gigas</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> heart cockles, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Clinocardium nuttallii</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> leather stars, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dermasterias imbricata</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis> kelp crabs, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pugettia producta</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">h</emphasis> dogwhelks, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nucella lamellosa</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis> barnacles, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chthamalus dalli</emphasis> (upper portion of image) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Balanus glandula</emphasis> (lower portion of image). See Methods for locations and dates of photos in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>.</p><p>As the lethal thermal limits for even the most tolerant local intertidal species are well below 50 \u00b0C, there was extensive mortality for numerous species at low tide. Species affected included barnacles, mussels, oysters, clams, gastropods, crabs, sea stars, and more (Fig. 6). Sessile species, which are unable to retreat to cooler microhabitats, were especially adversely impacted. Barnacle and mussel mortality, and the accompanying foul odor, was reported by researchers and concerned citizens from the southern end of Puget Sound, Washington State, to the BC Central Coast61. Mortality was particularly pronounced in the Strait of Georgia, where temperatures were especially high, and low tides were centered in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>On one representative mussel-dominated shoreline, the bay mussel (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mytilus trossulus</emphasis>) mortality rate was in excess of 70%, and over one million mussels were estimated to have died in a mere 100-m stretch of shoreline (see Methods). Surveys on a barnacle-dominated shoreline documented barnacle mortality rates that were also in excess of 70% even after factoring in pre-heatwave background mortality; at this site, the heatwave killed ~10 million barnacles (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Balanus glandula</emphasis>) along a single 100-m stretch of intertidal habitat (see Methods). While precise estimates for total heatwave-induced mortality along the highly heterogeneous ~7500 km coastline of the Salish Sea are difficult to make, similar magnitudes of proportional barnacle and mussel mortality were widely observed, and the total number of marine invertebrates killed was almost certainly in the billions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfires</emphasis></p><p>The persistent hot and dry conditions associated with the heatwave cured forest vegetation, resulting in extreme fire danger and increased wildfire activity. Figure 7 shows the increase in Fire Weather Index (FWI; see Methods), modeled smoke concentration, and satellite-detected hotspots between 20 June (pre-heatwave) and 3 July (post-heatwave). Over this period, BC went from six active wildfires with 123.5 hectares burned to 175 wildfires consuming 78,939 hectares. On 30 June, observed FWI values in Lytton, BC, reached an extraordinary value of 132 (typical values are between 0 and 30). By 11 July, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) increased Canada\u2019s National preparedness level to 5, its highest rank: wildfire suppression resources were limited, and aid from international agencies was requested.Fig. 7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heatwave impacts on wildfire conditions.</emphasis></p><p>Model estimated Fire Weather Index (FWI; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and smoke concentration and satellite hotspots (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) for pre-heatwave conditions on 20 June (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) and post-heatwave conditions on 3 July (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>). Smoke concentration in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> is represented by the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5. Satellite hotspots in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>, indicating likely wildfire activity, are shown by the red triangular markers.</p><p>During the heatwave itself, two noteworthy fires were discovered actively burning within the BC Southern Interior: the Sparks Lake Fire (discovered 28 June), and the McKay Creek Fire (discovered 29 June). Both are suspected to be human-caused, and were located in the Southwest Interior of BC, a zone that experienced some of the hottest and driest conditions throughout the heatwave. On the afternoon of 29 June, mid-tropospheric moisture moved into the high-pressure atmospheric ridge over the heatwave region, helping produce the thermodynamics for pyrocumulonimbus flammagenitus (CbFg) clouds to form over these burning wildfires. These CbFg clouds can produce large amounts of lightning, providing ignition for more fires62,63. Combustion of the forest vegetation produces smoke particles and releases additional water vapor into strong thermal updrafts above wildfires62. The combined smoke and water vapor rise to a cloud base, where they cool and the water vapor condenses into cloud droplets; this led to the development of CbFgs over each wildfire in the late afternoon on 29 and 30 June. On 30 June, the CbFgs were highly convective, producing positively charged anvil cloud tops that propagated northward (as determined from GOES-17 visible satellite imagery). Over the evening hours of 30 June approximately 120,800 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes occurred64, with the CIFFC reporting at least 127 new lightning-ignited wildfires from 30 June to 2 July.</p><p>The high-pressure atmospheric ridge began to breakdown ~30 June. This led to hot, dry, and now windy and unstable conditions, which fanned the flames of wildfires ignited by the CbFg lightning and enabled the rapid growth of these fires. The continued breakdown of the ridge and a cold frontal passage yielded more CbFgs and lightning with little precipitation. This cycle occurred each afternoon during the first week of July and ignited an average of more than 40 new wildfires each day in BC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agricultural yields</emphasis></p><p>The heatwave had pronounced impacts on agriculture in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, notably occurring during crucial growing stages of many crops. BC has the highest diversity of crops in Canada, with major field crops of canola, oats, wheat (particularly spring wheat), and barley, and produces more fruit than any other Canadian province65. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves can severely impact annual yields66, with temperatures exceeding a crop-dependent threshold resulting in substantial yield drops67. Yields in many crops show robust trends over time (often positive) due to a combination of technological and climate changes. Using estimated field, vegetable, and fruit yields from Statistics Canada (see Methods), we calculate linear regressions to estimate historical trends for each crop and to produce a predicted 2021 yield. We also calculate the standard deviation, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis>, of de-trended annual yields to quantify interannual variability. We compare the estimated 2021 yields to our predicted yields and interannual variability: of the 26 field, fruit, and vegetable crops for which data are available, 24 showed decreases relative to the predicted yield in 2021 (see Supplementary Fig. S4). It is, however, extremely difficult to isolate the impacts of one particular event on annual yield data66; we thus also use weekly resolution, satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; see Methods) to analyze the timing of changes in crop greenness relative to the heatwave. Reductions in NDVI indicate reductions in plant greenness, and therefore plant tissue damage, reduced growth, and/or reduced plant density.</p><p>In British Columbia, estimated field crop yields are substantially lower than predicted for many crops, with spring wheat reduced by 31% (1.9\u03c3), barley by 30% (2\u03c3), and canola by 21% (1.6\u03c3). Oat yields saw smaller declines with 2021 yields only 5% (0.4\u03c3) below-predicted yields; this smaller decline is consistent with 95% of the oat crop being grown in Peace River which experienced slightly less extreme temperatures during the heatwave than other regions (see \u2018PR\u2019 crop region in Fig. 1a and in Supplementary Fig. S5, which shows absolute maximum heatwave temperatures), although varying irrigation practices in different regions and for different crops may also play a role. Similar yield declines were seen in Alberta, with many field crop yields the lowest since the widespread drought of 2002, including canola (32% lower than predicted values), spring wheat (31%), barley (32%), and oats (29%). Anomalies for field crop yields in Alberta were all greater than 3\u03c3 (see Supplementary Fig. S4).</p><p>The production of many major fruit crops also faced major declines in 2021; BC\u2019s soft fruit production occurs predominantly in the Thompson-Okanagan (TO) region, which saw particularly extreme heatwave temperatures (see \u2018TO\u2019 in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S5). Decreases relative to predicted yields were greater than 2\u03c3 for sweet cherries, grapes, plums, and raspberries, with declines greater than 1\u03c3 in apples, nectarines, peaches, and pears. Not all fruit crops suffered equally, with, for example, cranberry yields only 2% below predicted, and in fact 10% above the 2011\u20132020 average due to a strongly positive historic trend. Several factors may influence these differences, including: timing of critical growth stages relative to the heatwave (e.g., sweet cherries and raspberries are harvested in July/August, and are thus likely to be in a critical growth stage in late June, whilst cranberries are harvested later); irrigation practices (cranberries have high irrigation coverage relative to many other crops); as well as spatial differences in the local temperatures. Vegetable yields also suffered in 2021 for many crops, with pumpkins, tomatoes, and radishes declining by greater than 2\u03c3, and Brussel sprouts, lettuce, green peas, squash, and zucchini yields reduced by greater than 1\u03c3 (see Supplementary Fig. S4). The livestock sector in BC also experienced significant mortalities during the heatwave, with reportedly at least 651,000 farm animals dying between 24 June to 30 June1.</p><p>Weekly averaged NDVI values for cropland in each of BC\u2019s agricultural regions are shown in Fig. 8, allowing analysis of the timing of changes in crop greenness relative to the heatwave period. In six out of the eight BC agricultural divisions, a noticeable drop in NDVI occurred during the heatwave period, with the strongest within-heatwave declines in the Cariboo, Kootenay, and Thompson-Okanagan regions, which saw some of the highest temperatures during the heatwave (see crop regions C, K, and TO in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S5). The timing of these decreases suggests that the unprecedented heatwave likely played a significant role in the annual yield declines recorded. Regional differences in NDVI decreases are likely a combination of differences in local meteorological conditions during the heatwave, dominant crops and their heat sensitivity/tolerance, and irrigation practices.Fig. 8</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heatwave impacts on crop health.</emphasis></p><p>Weekly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Crop Condition Assessment Program (see Methods), spatially averaged over agricultural divisions in British Columbia, organized alphabetically. 2021 values are shown in the black line, with the 2000\u20132020 climatology in blue and shading showing interannual variability for this 2000\u20132020 period (\u00b11 and 2 standard deviations). The gray highlighted region shows the heatwave period, 20 June\u20143 July; data are reported as weekly averages and so the heatwave is split between weeks 20\u201326 June and 27 June\u20143 July. The locations of the 8 agricultural divisions are shown in Fig. 1a in gray contours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glacier and snow melt</emphasis></p><p>The unprecedented heatwave had a pronounced influence on the region\u2019s cryosphere and hydrology both during the event and for months after. The heatwave-induced streamflow response was spatially variable across BC, in large part due to the variation in snowpack and glacier coverage throughout the province (see Supplementary Fig. S6a).</p><p>The exceptionally warm temperatures and clear sky conditions drove rapid ice and snow melt, leading to substantially increased streamflow in basins that had snow or ice available to melt (Fig. 9a\u2013f). In many cases, daily record high flows were achieved, with some all-time records broken (Supplementary Fig. S7). The rapid increase in streamflow led to flood warnings for several downstream communities and an evacuation order in the Pemberton Valley. In some cases, melt rates and daily streamflow rates decreased during the heatwave due to snowpack depletion, despite continuing extreme temperatures (e.g., Fig. 9d, f). Rainfall on 1\u20132 July in the Rocky Mountains near the BC/Alberta border exacerbated flooding and damages68, leading to substantial damages within BC\u2019s Mount Robson Provincial Park, and the helicopter evacuation of hikers69.Fig. 9</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heatwave impacts on streamflow.</emphasis></p><p>Streamflow observations at nine stream gauge stations in 2021 (black line) relative to the 1979\u20132020 median (blue line) and 1 standard deviation range (shaded). Gauges are organized from top to bottom by basin glacier coverage: highly glaciated basins (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), lightly glaciated basins (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>), and minimally or non-glaciated basins (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>). See Supplementary Fig. S6 for locations of these gauges.</p><p>Glacier melt is an important control of interannual summer streamflow variability70,71. The extensive snow melt during the heatwave exposed darker, lower-albedo glacier ice. Combined with persistent warm conditions through much of July this resulted in large amounts of seasonal glacier melt. While basins without substantial glacier coverage experienced lower than normal flows, the influx of glacier meltwater in glaciated basins resulted in late summer streamflows similar to the historical average (contrast Fig. 9a\u2013c with 9g\u2013i; see also Supplementary Fig. S6b), despite the substantial loss of snowpack during the heatwave. The ability of glaciers to sustain normal flows is notable considering the unprecedented nature of the heatwave, and came at the cost of substantial glacier mass loss72. The ability of glaciers to compensate for such extreme events is expected to diminish in the future with continued climate change73.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Landslides</emphasis></p><p>Wildfires can result in an increased risk of flooding, erosion, and landslides, due to impacts on both vegetation and soil74. Such impacts include a reduction of infiltration rate and water storage capacity, an increase in the susceptibility of the soil to erosion by raindrops, and in some cases increased water repellency of the soil below the surface74,75. These changes increase the susceptibility of slopes to debris flows, with studies showing that post-wildfire debris flows often occur in areas with moderate to high burn severity74,76. Extreme temperatures can also open desiccation cracks in fine-grained (clay and silt-rich) sediments. Those cracks can later allow ingress of rainwater to potential failure planes at depth which may exacerbate landslide hazards well after the heatwaves and wildfires have ended. Processes associated with wildfires in BC during 2021 are twofold. Firstly, the loss of vegetation and hydrophobicity of the soils led to a more pronounced stream runoff response with steeper hydrographs. Secondly, the added sediment charged the receiving rivers with excess sediment, locally aggrading channel beds and encouraging avulsions and bank erosion.</p><p>Hundreds of post-wildfire debris flows were triggered by rainstorms in the summer and fall of 2021 in southwestern BC (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S8). One of the largest wildfires associated with this heatwave was the Lytton Creek Fire, which began south of the village of Lytton and burned ~84,000 hectares77. In addition to the extensive damages to Lytton and Lytton First Nation reserves previously described, post-wildfire debris flows affected railway and highway infrastructure. On 16 August, debris flows impacted two semi-trailers and a car on the TransCanada Highway, with no fatalities reported. Further post-wildfire debris flows that damaged infrastructure but did not impact vehicles occurred on 17 September, and during an extreme atmospheric river event on 14\u201315 November.</p><p>Debris flows following the 16 August rainstorm in the Nicoamen River watershed are shown in Fig. 10. Rainfall rates were not unusually heavy: 4\u201310 mm h\u22121 over ~4 h, corresponding to a &lt;2-year return period event in this region. The fire-related water repellency in the soil caused soil rilling (a form of erosion) and in-channel sediment mobilization, resulting in abundant sediment transport. Further rainfall in the Nicoamen River watershed during the atmospheric river on 14\u201315 November remobilized the debris flow sediment as part of a post-wildfire debris flood that undermined three bridge approaches on the TransCanada Highway and one building foundation, resulting in one bridge collapse and necessitating repairs on another. Outside of the Nicoamen River, post-wildfire debris flows and debris floods in the Lytton Creek Fire perimeter severed railway and highway infrastructure (bridges and embankments) in nine other locations78. This event likely resulted in the most expensive natural disaster in Canada\u2019s history, with millions of dollars worth of damage along southwest BC\u2019s highways and railways with bridges, railways, and highway embankments failing.Fig. 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Example of post-wildfire debris flows following the heatwave.</emphasis></p><p>Post-wildfire debris flows in Nicoamen River watershed triggered by a rainstorm on 16 August 2021.

Diabatic processes (condensational heating, sensible heating, entrainment) both upstream of the high-pressure ridge and within it, played a dominant role in heating the air mass. While accurate forecast information was available in the days leading up to the event, and efforts were made to communicate the severity of the event and reduce heat mortality, hundreds of heat-related deaths still occurred, along with other human and ecological impacts. The unprecedented nature of this event made it difficult to anticipate and mitigate these impacts; understanding these impacts may help communities across the world better prepare for the record-shattering extreme heat events that are predicted to occur with increasing frequency as the climate continues to warm28.</p><p>The impacts of this heatwave highlight the urgency and necessity of improving both warning systems and heatwave preparedness in order to reduce mortality and other human and ecosystem impacts in future extreme heat events. This includes investing in: more research to better quantify and understand how climate change will likely affect extreme events; more research to understand regional impacts of unprecedented heat and how these impacts can be mitigated; improving our early warning systems through both improved forecasts, including on S2S timescales, and increased collaboration and communication between forecast providers and forecast users; and establishing systems and mitigation procedures that can be initiated in response to an early warning. Indeed, among other changes in response to this event, BC has established a new category of warning called an \u201cExtreme Heat Emergency\u201d, producing alerts analogous to similar systems for wildfires and flooding. The intent is to provide an appropriately coordinated and resourced provincial response when the next extreme heat event occurs. As we move into an unrelentingly warmer world due to anthropogenic global warming, extreme heat events across the globe are becoming increasingly common and more intense28,79. The extraordinary nature of this extreme heatwave highlights that all jurisdictions should be working to address the inevitable risk of unprecedented heat; in particular, we urge regions and jurisdictions that have not experienced an extreme heat event in recent decades to act now, before such a disaster occurs.</p><p>Many of the negative effects of this heatwave were disproportionately felt by First Nations communities (e.g., the Lytton fire, as well as numerous effects of ecosystem impacts on communities with close relationships with the land, water, and natural resources), the elderly, and people living in neighborhoods with higher material and social deprivation, highlighting the importance of climate justice in the response to climate change80. Indeed, health vulnerability to heatwaves is known to be distributed unequally81, with higher levels of material and social deprivation a vulnerability factor in previous heatwaves as well82. There is thus an urgent need to provide better protection and resources to our most vulnerable populations so that natural disasters do not continue to amplify existing inequalities and systemic racism.</p><p>The catastrophic impacts of this unprecedented heatwave underscore the importance of understanding extreme weather events and how their frequency or intensity will change with anthropogenic climate change, and, crucially, how to mitigate their impacts. Raju et al. (2022)83 argue that disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability, and that we can, and should, work to reduce both the hazards (through rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to true net-zero, or net-negative) and the vulnerability (through changing social and political systems). This unprecedented heatwave has provided lessons and examples that we can learn from, and provides us with a vivid depiction of why and how climate change can be so devastating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Overview/introduction</emphasis></p><p>To analyze heatwave temperatures, we use daily maximum 2 m temperatures (TX) from weather stations, and from the ERA5 reanalysis84, a gridded dataset that assimilates observations. A previous version of the ECMWF reanalysis, ERA-interim, performs well relative to pure-observation datasets for temperature extremes85 and thus we expect ERA5 to provide an accurate assessment. ERA5 data were downloaded from the C3S datastore86,87 on a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 spatial grid, and daily maximum temperatures were calculated from hourly maximum temperatures. Station data for Lytton, BC, were obtained from the Meteorological Service of Canada; for dates with more than one active Lytton station, averages across stations were taken prior to the calculation of the climatology.</p><p>We calculate TX anomalies relative to daily climatology from 1981\u20132020, and then calculate a 3-day running mean of these anomalies. Figure 1a shows the maximum value of this running mean over the heatwave period 22 June to 3 July 2021. Using temperature anomalies is a useful method of removing spatial differences in absolute temperatures; however, some impacts, such as those on crops or the cryosphere, are often related to absolute temperature thresholds. We therefore also show the maximum 3-day running mean of absolute TX heatwave values in Supplementary Fig. S5.</p><p>To analyze record temperature exceedances (shown in Fig. 2) we calculate the maximum TX (TXX) over the heatwave period from 22 June\u20143 July 2021, and for a historical period from 1 January 1950 through to 1 June 2021. The difference between these is shown in Fig. 2, with the 2003 European heatwave (TXX between 1 July\u201431 August 2003 relative to TXX between 1 January 1950\u20141 June 2003), and the 2010 Russian heatwave (TXX between 1 July 2010\u201431 August 2010 relative to TXX between 1 January 1950\u20141 June 2010).</p><p>In Fig. 2a we include record temperature exceedances for observations (shown in the individual markers) from the Canadian Long-Term Climate Extremes database, created by the Meteorological Service of Canada88. For this dataset \u201cvirtual\u201d climate stations were created by joining together climate data from nearby stations to make long-term records, allowing for longer records than looking at individual stations. We show data only for virtual stations that go back to at least 1949, with the longest record starting in 1874. These data have not been quality controlled to remove artifacts such as discontinuities and non-climate trends; however, the dataset is updated frequently, allowing us to use it for recent events. We expect the \u2018record exceedance\u2019 values from individual stations to be generally slightly lower than for the ERA5 dataset, as many of the records are longer, although the spatial averaging of the ERA5 dataset may counter this effect. The general extent and distribution of the record exceedances are similar (see Fig. 2a), with close agreement over the station of Lytton (shown in the red triangle in Fig. 2a), where the new Canadian daily record maximum temperature was set: the ERA5 gridpoint value has a record exceedance of 5.7 \u00b0C, while the Lytton station record was broken by 5.2 \u00b0C.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Synoptic conditions</emphasis></p><p>The description of the synoptic conditions was produced through analysis of the evolution of geopotential height, wind speed, precipitable water, relative humidity, temperature, and sea-level pressure fields, at various levels in the atmosphere.</p><p>To gain insight into the processes responsible for the low-level temperature anomaly, 4-day backwards trajectories terminating at 500 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis> above ground level (AGL) within the heatwave region (see box in Fig. 1a) at 0100 UTC 28 June (6 pm 27 June local time) were calculated using the NOAA HYSPLIT model using data from GFS 0.25\u00b0 forecast data (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To quantify the roles of diabatic vs adiabatic heating, 63 trajectories are analyzed; in the figures, produced using the online version of HYSPLIT, HYSPLIT-WEB5,89, only nine trajectories are presented for readability. Both potential temperature changes (to quantify diabatic heating/cooling) and changes in pressure (to quantify adiabatic heating/cooling) along the trajectories were examined. To determine likely physical processes responsible for changes in potential temperature and pressure, parcel positions at the time/location of the changes were cross-referenced with maps of the fields mentioned in the above paragraph (e.g., increases in potential temperature while the parcel was ascending within a saturated air mass suggest condensational heating was the dominant diabatic process).</p><p>Changes in potential temperature (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b8</emphasis>) are solely due to diabatic processes, so temperature changes due to diabatic processes can be calculated simply as:1where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote values at the start and end of the backwards trajectories respectively. To calculate adiabatic changes, we use the equation for potential temperature:2where , <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> is pressure, and P<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis> is standard pressure, i.e., 1000 hPa. The change in temperature due to adiabatic processes (i.e. with no change in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b8</emphasis>, such that \u03b82 = \u03b81) is , i.e.:3</p><p>and  were calculated for each of the 63 trajectories, yielding average values of 14.00 K and 3.98 K, respectively, with a total change of 17.98 K. This gives estimated contributions of 78% and 22% for diabatic and adiabatic heating respectively. The relative contributions of diabatic and adiabatic processes can also be seen in the lower panels of Fig. 4 (showing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03b8</emphasis> along the trajectories) and Supplementary Fig. S1, showing atmospheric pressure along the trajectories, giving information on adiabatic changes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forecasts</emphasis></p><p>Over the past decade, \u201censemble\u201d weather forecasting has become prevalent in operational forecast offices, particularly at the medium to long forecast horizons (~4-14 days into the future). A forecast ensemble contains many models, or \u201cmembers,\u201d that typically have varied initial states and/or physics parameters. The benefits of this approach are twofold: (1) the mean or median of the ensemble forecasts, typically taken as the most likely outcome, is usually more accurate than any single model and less subject to false alarms; and (2) the members sample the uncertainty space, thus giving users a sense of the range and probability of various outcomes. Statistical post-processing is typically applied to the raw ensemble output to improve the accuracy of both the mean/median, and the probabilities derived from the distribution of ensemble members.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Subseasonal forecasts</emphasis></p><p>This heatwave was characterized by record-breaking surface temperatures and a slowly propagating blocking high with extreme geopotential anomalies at 500 hPa (z500). Thus, to evaluate the subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts, we focus on probabilistic forecasts of 2 m air temperature (t2m) anomalies and frequency of blocking90 observed over the days between 25 June and 1 July, and compare to those in ERA5 data84. Soil moisture analysis was conducted using ERA5-land data91.</p><p>We use the state-of-the-art ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model, one of 11 models available as part of the S2S prediction project database92. The IFS has 51 forecast ensemble members, with 11 reforecast members implemented over the previous 20 years, and a maximum resolution of 0.5\u00b0. Forecasts and reforecasts are initialized twice a week. Previous evaluations of ECMWF indicate good performance up to lead times of 7\u201310 days for extreme cold events93, up to 11 days for daily precipitation94, up to 15 days for heatwaves95,96, and up to 20 days for soil moisture97.</p><p>To understand the prediction skill of ensemble forecasts for an extreme event we take a probabilistic approach98. We investigate the forecast skill in predicting \u2018an extreme\u2019, rather than necessarily an extreme of the magnitude observed. We show results for an extreme event defined as one exceeding the 95th percentile, but similar results are obtained for the 90th and 99th percentiles. We identify the 95th percentile threshold for the variable of interest (temporally averaged t2m anomalies or number of blocked days) from 25 June to 1 July across all reforecast years (2001\u20132020) and all ensemble members. We then calculate the fraction of forecast ensemble members that predicted t2m anomalies or number of blocked days higher than this threshold for 25 June to 1 July 2021. Comparison to the expected value for a climatological forecast (0.05 for the 95th percentile) gives the increased probability of the event as predicted by the ensemble forecast.</p><p>The model climatology, required to calculate anomalies, was calculated from the reforecast data using the methodology of Owens and Hewson99, averaging data from reforecasts initialized on the same day-of-year as the forecast being analyzed, as well as reforecasts initialized in the days/weeks prior to, and following, the forecast initialization date. This method eliminates systematic biases of the forecasted weather relative to the climatology, and accounts for model drift due to changing lead times. The original methodology has a slight difference in the number of consecutive reforecasts used to calculate the climatology for lead times greater than, or &lt;15 days; for consistency across all lead times considered in this work, we calculate all climatologies using 5 consecutive reforecasts. The climatology is calculated for years 2001\u20132020. For example, for the forecasts initialized on 14 June 2021, the climatology is calculated from reforecasts initialized on 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 June from all years from 2001\u20132020. For consistency between models and reanalysis data, the ERA5 climatology is calculated using years 2001\u20132020 and smoothed using a 5-day running mean.</p><p>Blocking frequency was calculated based on a modified100 version of the algorithm proposed by Dunn-Sigouin et al.101,102, using geopotential height at 500 hPa (z500). For the algorithm to define a block, a persistent, positive z500 anomaly, spanning at least 106 km<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis>, must occur in the same region as a reversal of the meridional absolute z500 gradient. Anomalies must be greater than a given threshold calculated using data from all longitudes and latitudes 30\u201390\u00b0N (data normalized by latitude); we use a threshold of 1 standard deviation100. In the original method the standard deviation is calculated for a 3-month period centered around the given month; to implement this for the forecasts using a methodology that could be operationalised (i.e., not relying on information from the future), we calculate the standard deviation based on all June values from ensemble members with June initializations across all available years. As the number of ensemble members varies between forecast (2021) and reforecast (2001\u20132020) years, standard deviations are calculated separately for each year and then averaged. The persistence requirement is considered to be satisfied if the event lasts for at least 5 days.</p><p>To compare to ERA5 data, in Fig. 5 the location of the heatwave event in ERA5 is shown in gray contours, as determined by temperature anomalies greater than the 90th percentile and 5 \u00b0C, and areas where there is blocking for at least 5 of the 7 days (25 June to 1 July inclusive).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change context</emphasis></p><p>Analysis of the temperature trends was conducted using the Berkeley Earth temperature anomaly dataset103. We calculate annual and JJA (June-August) averages of latitude-weighted monthly mean, and monthly mean daily maximum (TX) temperatures over land for the region 45N\u201352\u00b0N, 119W\u2013123\u00b0W, as highlighted in Fig. 1a; results are relatively insensitive to changes in this region definition. We analyze data over the period 1875\u20132020, the time period for which there was a valid value for every gridbox over the selected region in the Berkeley Earth dataset, and excluding the 2021 heatwave event. We calculate linear fits to approximate the trends, finding a value of 0.10 \u00b0C/decade (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value 0.4E-9) for annual mean temperatures, 0.07 \u00b0C/decade (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value 0.3E-5) for JJA mean temperatures, and 0.04 \u00b0C/decade (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value 0.1) for JJA monthly mean TX.</p><p>The PAMIP simulations analyzed are described in detail in Smith et al.35, and were designed to isolate the impacts of sea-ice loss and sea surface temperature (SST) changes on atmospheric circulation. The experiments we analyze use fixed SSTs and sea-ice concentration (SIC) as boundary conditions for an atmosphere-only general circulation model. To isolate the impact of sea-ice loss alone on atmospheric circulation patterns, we use simulations with present-day SSTs and pre-industrial Arctic SIC (pdSST-piSIC), present-day SSTs and present-day SIC (pdSST-pdSIC), and present-day SSTs with future Arctic SIC (pdSST-futArcSIC). We further contrast the present-day simulations (pdSST-pdSIC) with those with pre-industrial SSTs and SIC (piSST-piSIC) to understand if changes in SST may have increased the probability of amplified atmospheric waves<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p>There are many available metrics of atmospheric \u2018waviness\u2019; to avoid results that may be highly sensitive to the metric selected, we choose two metrics that use different variables on different levels within the atmosphere. The first is the finite-amplitude local wave activity (LWA);104,105 we calculate the LWA using geopotential height at 500 hPa (z500), a formulation which has been shown to be strongly connected to persistent weather systems106, with the anti-cyclonic LWA (a-LWA) associated with blocking107. We analyze differences within the PAMIP simulations in a-LWA. The second metric used is an algorithm to detect recurrent, or quasi-stationary, Rossby waves;108,109 this metric, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>, uses 14-day running mean meridional wind speeds at 250 hPa (v250). When applied to ERA5 reanalysis data84 both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a-LWA</emphasis> show a positive anomaly over the PNW region during the heatwave event relative to the 1979\u20132020 climatology for June/July, demonstrating their suitability as metrics for this type of event.</p><p>We analyze results from two models from the PAMIP project, the IPSL-CM6A-LR, and CanESM5, downloaded using acccmip6110. These models were chosen as the only models with both z500 and v250 at the required daily temporal resolution available on the Earth System Grid at the time of research. These two models cover a wide range of the different model responses of the mid-latitude circulation to sea-ice loss within the PAMIP model ensemble, with the CanESM5 showing a strong reduction in mid-latitude zonal winds, and the IPSL-CM6A-LR a similar, but much weaker response36<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis> We note that imposing sea-ice loss alone misses other aspects of the AA response to anthropogenic warming111, and the response may be sensitive to how or where AA is imposed112,113.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human health impacts</emphasis></p><p>All information in this section has been taken from other published reports or sources. Excess deaths, heat-attributable deaths, and mortality rates, during and after the heatwave were sourced from British Columbia Centre for Disease Control48 and coroners reports for BC49, State or County reports for the states of Washington51 and Oregon114, and local news reporting of preliminary reports for Alberta50. Estimates of heat-related mortality can vary between different reports due to different definitions and reporting methods. For example, \u2018excess deaths\u2019 can differ from \u2018heat-related deaths\u2019, where in the latter, excessive heat has been specifically identified as a contributing factor in the cause of death. Heatwaves can also contribute to deaths that occur in the days or weeks following the event itself, and attributing these deaths to the heatwave can be difficult and time-consuming, and thus estimates for this heatwave may continue to be revised. Non-fatal hospital admission data were from hospitals reporting to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program.

The odor of rotting marine life was still pronounced at this site even 10\u201312 days after the peak of the heatwave. Randomly placed 100 cm2 quadrats (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20) were used to determine the number of live and dead mussels. Because mussels gape very soon after death (see Fig. 6b, c) and this survey was conducted 10 days after the heatwave, we assumed that mussels with closed valves were alive, and categorized empty, gaping shells as dead. The mean mortality across quadrats was 73.6 \u00b1  6.2% (mean \u00b1 s.e.), with an average of 10.0 \u00b1 1.8 dead mussels per 100 cm<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> quadrat (equivalent to 1000 dead mussels per m<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis>). The mussel population at this site occurred primarily in a zone 12-meters wide (cross-shore), suggesting that ~1,200,000 mussels died within the ~100 m alongshore extent of this boulder field. Although mussel shells remain attached to the shore via byssus for many weeks after death, we cannot rule out that our surveys slightly underestimated mortality due to shell loss (there was some evidence for this in some quadrats), or overestimated it by including previously dead animals (although the percentage of standing dead mussels is typically low as evidenced by near 100% live mussel cover at microsites in Porteau Cove and elsewhere spared from the heatwave by seaweed canopy or north-facing topographic orientation).</p><p>Estimates of barnacle deaths were obtained from random quadrat sampling (100 cm<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2</emphasis> quadrats, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 25) of barnacles (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B. glandula</emphasis>) at a gently sloping cobble and boulder shore (1001 Steps Park, 49.0306\u00b0N, \u2212122.8752\u00b0W). Unlike mussels, which gape very soon after death, barnacles can retain their opercular plates for a few weeks after they have died, making mortality more difficult to discern visually. The barnacle mortality surveys reported here were conducted on 25 July 2021, which allowed sufficient time for opercular plates of recently-deceased barnacles to detach and wash away. Barnacles lacking opercular plates were recorded as dead; barnacles with opercular plates held in their natural position were assumed to be alive, which was confirmed by prodding the opercular plates of a subset of these individuals with a pencil to verify the presence of a living animal holding them closed. Sampling revealed 80.6 \u00b1 5.7% mortality (mean \u00b1 s.e.), which far exceeds the pre-heatwave background frequency of standing dead measured at this site (7.9 \u00b1 1.2%). The absolute number of excess dead barnacles per 100 cm2 quadrat was 54.8 \u00b1 9.4 (equivalent to 5480 per m2). Scaling up to the entire barnacle zone at this site (18 m wide in the cross-shore direction) suggests this heatwave killed roughly 10 million barnacles along a single 100 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis> stretch of cobble shoreline. Qualitative surveys of barnacle and mussel mortality at other sites in BC and Washington State suggest that these high rates of mortality were experienced throughout much of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia, with lower but still noticeable mortality further north along the BC Central Coast61.</p><p>Intertidal temperatures during the peak of the heatwave (the afternoon of 28 June 2021 in the vicinity of Vancouver, BC) were recorded with a FLIR E40 camera (Fig. 6a, b).

We analyze yields for the four main food field crops in BC\u2014canola, oats, spring wheat, and barley\u2014and all fruit and vegetables crops in BC for which complete data existed (with no missing years) for the required variables for at least 2007\u20132021.</p><p>For field crops, yields were taken directly from the Statistics Canada data, as total production/area harvested. Fruit yields are not available as a direct variable, and so were calculated from marketed production/cultivated area. We use marketed production instead of total production to increase data availability\u2014total production reporting starts in 2011 and has numerous missing years, compared to marketed production reporting starting in 2002 or 2007 (for different fruit). Similarly, we use cultivated area, not bearing area, to increase the number of years of data available and to include in-field losses, i.e., crops that are not even harvested. Whilst this is not the standard definition of yield (total production/area harvested), repeating the calculations with marketed production/bearing area gives similar conclusions for 2021 anomalies. Vegetable yields are calculated as total production/area planted, and thus, as for fruit, our analysis includes in-field losses. Repeating the analysis using total production/area harvested shows similar conclusions for 2021, although generally, the anomalies are smaller, suggesting larger in-field losses in 2021 relative to other years.</p><p>To look at 2021 yield anomalies, deviations from the long-term average were determined by first calculating linear annual yield growth rates for each crop (1980\u20132020 for field crops; 2002\u20132020 for fruit and vegetables, with the exception of apricots, cranberries, sweet cherries, Brussel sprouts, pumpkins, and squash and zucchini, all of which are 2007\u20132020). By fitting a linear yield trend, we are able to account for long-term trends due to technological changes and low-frequency climate variability and change. We use these trends to predict the yield for 2021, and calculate the 2021 yield anomaly as the difference between the reported yield and this prediction. To provide an estimate of the magnitude of the 2021 yield changes relative to typical interannual variability, for each crop we calculate the standard deviation, \u03c3, of the annual yield values after removing the linear trend. 2021 anomalies in units of \u03c3 are shown for all evaluated crops in Supplementary Fig. S4a. Supplementary Fig. S4b\u2013d shows time series with linear trends and standard deviations for the BC field, fruit, and vegetable crops with the largest 2021 anomalies.</p><p>The NDVI is often used to estimate crop yields123 and NDVI values are made publicly available for the agricultural region of Canada from Statistics Canada\u2019s Crop Condition Assessment Program (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www35.statcan.gc.ca/CCAP/en/index\">https://www35.statcan.gc.ca/CCAP/en/index</url>). The NDVI is calculated during the growing season from 1000 m resolution digital data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of satellites and the 250 m MODIS digital data to monitor the changing vegetation conditions on a 7-day cycle. We download these data for regions designated as \u201ccropland\u201d by the Crop Condition Assessment Program (CCAP), and spatially averaged over the 8 census agricultural regions of British Columbia (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/95-630-x/2017000/pdf/Prov59_CARCD-eng.pdf?st=ENVUsTeF\">https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/95-630-x/2017000/pdf/Prov59_CARCD-eng.pdf?st=ENVUsTeF</url>).

Snow water equivalent data were taken from the ERA5-Land hourly dataset91. Glacier area and location data are from the Randolph Glacier Inventory V6.0125, whilst basin areas and outlines are from the Water Survey of Canada126. Basin glacier coverage is calculated as the summed area of all glaciers125 within a basin126 divided by the basin area124.</p><p>Record streamflow values were identified using the Hydrometric data from Environment Canada (<url normalizedValue=\"https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/mainmenu/real_time_data_index_e.html\">https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/mainmenu/real_time_data_index_e.html</url>). Examples of all-time record flow during this extreme heatwave are shown in Supplementary Fig. S7a\u2013c. Supplementary Fig. S7d shows daily streamflow records broken for consecutive days on the Lillooet River near Pemberton, where an evacuation order was issued, although the all-time record was not broken.</p><p>During the heatwave event, flood watches and warnings along with high streamflow advisories were issued by the BC River Forecast Centre (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm\">http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm</url>) and an evacuation order was issued by the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District.

Vegetation burn severity data were produced by the BC Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development127 using differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and classified according to the United States Forest Service Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) system128. Soil burn severity was also evaluated in the field to verify the classification of low, moderate, and high severity provided by the remotely sensed burn severity data. Field evaluation of burn severity was classified based on the apparent degree of mortality of the vegetative canopy and understory, depth of combusted organic matter in the soil, and presence of water repellency. Shallow (&lt;25 cm) test pits were hand dug to identify the percentage of ground cover burned, ash color and depth, changes to soil structure, depth to unburned roots, and soil water repellency. The test pits were accompanied by observations of the forest type and percentage of tree canopy burned. Soil burn severity corresponded to remotely sensed vegetation burn severity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>Intertidal surveys were conducted on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the Coast Salish peoples.

A new Johns Hopkins University study finds stories to be significantly more motivating than scientific facts at least for some people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After hearing a compelling pollution-related story in which a man died, the average person paid more for green products than after having heard scientific facts about water pollution. But the average person in the study was a Democrat. Republicans paid less after hearing the story rather than the simple facts.</p><p>The findings, published this week in the journal One Earth, suggest message framing makes a real difference in people's actions toward the environment. It also suggests there is no monolithic best way to motivate people and policymakers must work harder to tailor messages for specific audiences.</p><p>\"Our findings suggest the power of storytelling may be more like preaching to the choir,\" said co-author Paul J. Ferraro, an evidence-based environmental policy expert and the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Human Behavior and Public Policy at Johns Hopkins.</p><p>\"For those who are not already leaning toward environmental action, stories might actually make things worse.\"</p><p>Scientists have little scientific evidence to guide them on how best to communicate with the public about environmental threats. Increasingly, scientists have been encouraged to leave their factual comfort zones and tell more stories that connect with people personally and emotionally. But scientists are reluctant to tell such stories because, for example, no one can point to a deadly flood or a forest fire and conclusively say that the deaths were caused by climate change.</p><p>The question researchers hoped to answer with this study: Does storytelling really work to change people's behavior? And if so, for whom does it work best?</p><p>\"We said let's do a horserace between a story and a more typical science-based message and see what actually matters for purchasing behavior,\" Ferraro said.</p><p>Researchers conducted a field experiment involving just over 1,200 people at an agricultural event in Delaware. Everyone surveyed had lawns or gardens and lived in watershed known to be polluted.</p><p>Through a random-price auction, researchers attempted to measure how much participants were willing to pay for products that reduce nutrient pollution. Before people could buy the products, they watched a video with either scientific facts or story about nutrient pollution.</p><p>In the story group, participants viewed a true story about a local man's death that had plausible but tenuous connections to nutrient pollution: he died after eating contaminated shellfish. In the scientific facts group, participants viewed an evidence-based description of the impacts of nutrient pollution on ecosystems and surrounding communities.</p><p>After watching the videos, all participants had a chance to purchase products costing less than $10 that could reduce storm water runoff: fertilizer, soil test kits, biochar and soaker hoses.</p><p>People who heard the story were on average willing to pay more than those who heard the straight science. But the results skewed greatly when broken down by political party. The story made liberals 17 percent more willing to buy the products, while making conservatives want to spend 14 percent less.</p><p>The deep behavioral divide along party lines surprised Ferraro, who typically sees little difference in behavior between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to matters such as energy conservation.</p><p>\"We hope this study stimulates more work about how to communicate the urgency of climate change and other global environmental challenges,\" said lead author Hilary Byerly, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Colorado. \"Should the messages come from scientists? And what is it about this type of story that provokes environmental action from Democrats but turns off Republicans?\"</p><p>Authors included: Tongzhe Li of University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada; Kent D. Messer of University of Delaware; and Collin Weigel of Johns Hopkins.</p><p>This research was supported by contributions from the Penn Foundation, the US Department of Agriculture, The Nature Conservancy, and the National Science Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124417446</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62J1-H5K1-DYTH-G4S6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 26, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Tom Witham/USDA) </p><p><br/>The incoming chairman of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee wants to allow more mining and believes technology \u2014 not limitations on fossil fuel production \u2014 is the best way to address climate change. <br/>As part of their organization of the chamber they now control, U.S. House Republicans selected Arkansas' Bruce Westerman to lead the panel that oversees the U.S. Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service and has a major role in shaping federal energy and environmental policy. <br/>Its power, though, will be severely checked for at least the next two years by a Democratic Senate and president. <br/>In an interview with States Newsroom, Westerman, a forester with a background in engineering, said his direction for the panel would depart from that of Democrats. <br/>He'd rather focus on technology \u2014 including nuclear energy, carbon sequestration and biochar, a 2,500-year-old technique of heating wood, manure and other biomass to create carbon charcoal with multiple uses \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions and atmospheric buildup, than on limiting industry. <br/> Need to get in touch? Have a news tip? <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@idahocapitalsun.com\">info@idahocapitalsun.com</email>  ; <br/>Westerman also said he'd work to open more mining development to gather resources like cobalt, nickel, copper and others needed to build electric vehicles and additional tools of an energy transition, though he added electric vehicles' potential to reduce carbon emissions was overstated. <br/>Congress should have a role in shaping a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, he said, but lawmakers should be mindful that it's a global issue and that developing countries are not trading their own economic growth to limit emissions \u2014 and perhaps the United States shouldn't either. <br/>'We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution,' he said. <br/>The following interview, conducted by phone on Jan. 26, has been condensed and edited for clarity. <br/>States Newsroom: Just to start out, what are your priorities for the committee's work this Congress? <br/>Bruce Westerman: You may or may not be aware of our Commitment to America (House Republicans' proposed agenda heading into the 2022 midterms[1]) that we put out. Part of that is energy security, national security, energy independence. <br/>And that's really a broad subject. It involves not just oil and gas, but also all the mining and critical minerals that are needed for the electrification that's being proposed and ties in with Chinese supply chains. <br/>So there's a lot of things tied up in our Commitment to America that the Natural Resources Committee will have a role in. Energy and mining is a huge one of those. <br/>The United States has been blessed with natural resources. There's been a mentality that we're going to lock those resources up and not use them \u2014 kind of a not-in-my-backyard mentality \u2014 mainly coming from the left. But the fact is that if we're not producing them here, they're being produced somewhere else in the world and they're being produced in a less environmentally friendly way, and less environmental, health and safety regulations on it. <br/>SN: Are you talking about the rare earth metals or other types of mining? Or what in particular? <br/>BW: All of the above. <br/>If you look at China in particular, and their supply, the amount of rare earths and other minerals that they mined and supply to the world, they're almost on a different scale on the charts. And we're very dependent upon products that are made with processed minerals out of China. <br/>We still have a large part of our economy that's based on that. But I think it's pretty low compared to the Chinese economy. We use about $900 billion of processed minerals in the United States a year, and we generate about $3.3 to $3.4 trillion of GDP on that, so it's still a huge part of our economy. <br/>But we're also importing a lot of those processed minerals from China. And we're also buying a lot of products that are manufactured in China, which is essentially exporting our wealth to the Chinese government. <br/>We can look at natural resources as a way to leverage our U.S. economy against the Chinese economy. <br/>We can talk about Russia in that as well, with oil and gas. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1383110573.jpg\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1383110573.jpg</url>U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, speaks at a House Republican news conference on energy policy at the U.S. Capitol on March 8, 2022, in Washington, D.C. The Republicans said they support President Biden's ban on Russian oil imports but urged the administration to increase domestic production to help curb high gas prices. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) <br/>SN: Just to go back for a second. You talked about the mining needed for 'the electrification that's being proposed.' Like, more electric vehicles? Or what did you mean by that? <br/>BW: All of the above. You can't have electric vehicles without having a place to plug them in. And you can't have a place to plug them in without increasing the size of the grid. You've got to be able to generate more electricity. <br/>If you're going to generate it with wind and solar, you're going to have to have a tremendous amount of things manufactured from elements and minerals to generate that electricity, or we're going to be generating it the way we're generating 69% of it right now and that's with fossil fuels. <br/>So it's a very complicated network of interactions there and all of it is dependent upon energy and minerals. <br/>I think the problem with the Democrats' and the Biden administration's approach is that \u2014 what I've been saying is they have two problems. I think they have not defined the problem correctly. Hence, they're trying to go about solving the problem in the wrong way. <br/>I think electric cars are fascinating, but electric cars in the United States are going to do very, very little, if anything, to decrease global carbon emissions. And if all the eggs are in that basket in the U.S., there's going to have to be a tremendous amount of mining for lithium and copper and cobalt, nickel, a lot of ingredients that go into an electric car. <br/>And then at the end of the day, it could have an impact of less than 1% global greenhouse gas reductions, if you were able to convert every passenger car and light-duty truck in America to an electric vehicle overnight. <br/>That's less than 15% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the United States. Twenty-seven percent of that comes from all of transportation[2], then 57% of that comes from light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles. So now you're down to a little over 2%. And then you look at the fact that only 31% of our electricity comes from a non-carbon-emitting source. <br/>So you're below 1% global impact on carbon emissions, and I don't think we're going to get the bang for our buck putting all our eggs in the basket of electric vehicles. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe</url><br/><br/>Plus, if you want carbon-free energy, wind and solar, they're two sources, but they're just a blip on the chart. It's going to have to be something like nuclear power or someday maybe fusion power to generate enough electricity to offset the electricity that's being produced by coal, oil and natural gas and biomass right now. <br/>SN: So if Democrats are not defining the question correctly, how would you define it? <br/>BW: That's a great question, I'm glad you asked. <br/>I think Democrats have defined the problem in the context of: The climate is changing. It's changing because of carbon in the atmosphere. We must stop all carbon from going into the atmosphere. <br/>The part they're leaving out of that is that the quality of life in the world is increasing because of innovation in energy. There's a developing world out there that wants to have the same kinds of energy and the benefits that come from having energy. And the world has an insatiable appetite for more energy. <br/>The Democrats' approach is to remove fossil fuels, which maybe someday we can do that, but we're a long way from getting to that point. <br/>And if you look globally, developing countries are building energy-generating systems which utilize fossil fuels much faster than we're building windmills or solar farms, which have much less energy density. <br/>So, we've got to work on a couple of different fronts, innovation being one of them. What the world wants is reliable and affordable energy, and we've got to be the innovators that figure out how to make that clean. <br/>The technology we've got right now, you go down the logic diagram, and you end up with nuclear power, because, quite frankly, you can't build enough windmills and solar farms to offset the amount of energy that's produced from fossil fuels right now. <br/>But people have a problem with nuclear power. The largest component of green power that we have right now is hydropower. And you have people wanting to tear dams down. So that's going the opposite direction. <br/>SN: Should we be working to reduce carbon emissions? Or is that sort of secondary to having plentiful energy supplies? <br/>BW: We've got to work to reduce carbon emissions, but you've got to do it in the context of reality that there's a world that has an insatiable appetite for energy. <br/>And when China builds a new coal-fired plant every week, which they've been doing for the past several years, it absorbs any carbon reduction benefits that we've created here in the U.S.<br/>There's too much focus on electric cars, and it's like a red herring that you do this, and it's going to fix the problem and it's not. Show me the math that says it's going to fix the problem. It's much larger scale than that. And if we cut our fossil fuel usage, the rest of the world's not going to. <br/>SN: But does that mean it's not worth doing? It seems like if it's a worldwide effort, that the United States could be a leader in that effort worldwide. <br/>BW: We're already a leader. <br/>We're relying on technology that has to be subsidized. India doesn't have money to subsidize wind farms and solar panels. African nations can't do that. <br/>And you just look at the order of magnitude of how much energy you can produce from a windmill and a solar farm, and, again, we're trying to solve the wrong problem. <br/>The other side of that is we got to work on ways to get carbon out of the atmosphere that's already there. That's why I'm a big proponent of natural solutions and why I think forestry and innovative products like biochar can play a huge role in removing carbon from the atmosphere. <br/>You got to look at both sides of the equation. How much are you putting up, and how much are you taking out? <br/>SN: It sounds like you're saying it's less worthwhile to try and artificially limit fossil fuel supply and usage and more about working on research and development to make energy cleaner and on a larger scale. Is that fair? <br/>BW: We've got to work on it every day, making every form of energy we've got cleaner and safer and healthier. <br/>Now, the problem is there has to be a transition time. There may be a day when we can have carbon-free energy, but the reality is it's nowhere close. Not even remotely close. And we can't solve that in the United States by building electric cars. <br/>SN: But do you think Congress should be working toward that transition and that should be an objective? <br/>BW: I think it should, but it has to be in the realm of reality. It has to be with eyes wide open, knowing that somebody in a developing country that doesn't have the quality of life that they see the rest of the world having, they don't really care about how much carbon is in the atmosphere. <br/>I mean, look no further than China and the number of coal-fired plants they're building so they can generate electricity to create jobs, to manufacture stuff to ship to the rest of the world. <br/>So, I just want people to take a realistic approach to it and not just push stuff that I would call eyewash. It's not a valid solution. My background is in engineering, my undergraduate degree's in engineering. And they teach you problem-solving process and the first thing you have to do to solve a problem is to define the problem correctly. <br/>And I think that our current policy in the country has greatly missed what the definition of a problem is and therefore we're working towards solutions that aren't going to solve any kind of a problem anytime soon. <br/>And it's more than reality. It's, it's not realizing that people desire to have energy, they desire to have a better way of life. And they can't afford it. <br/>SN: When you talk about like the developing world and China and India, are you saying that because their carbon emissions we have no control over and they're likely to grow, maybe grow very fast, that then we shouldn't make a tradeoff to limit our own emissions in the United States? Is that sort of what you're getting at? <br/>BW: No. We can't wreck our economy for something that's not going to be a valid solution. <br/>The hope is that America would be the innovators, that we would continually work to make the energy sources we have cleaner and that eventually we'll develop the technology that the rest of the world adopts that is reliable and affordable and that happens to be clean as well. <br/>But the path that we're on is one that would do great harm to our economy and do harm to our ability to actually solve these problems in the future. I wish we were in person; I've got a chart I can show you the global demand for energy global consumption by source. And you just about need a magnifying glass to see where wind, solar, and other renewables fit on the chart. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/donate\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/donate</url><br/><br/>And it's growing at an exponential rate. The world consumption of energy doubled from 1800 to 1900. It doubled again in 1942 and doubled again in the mid-60s, doubled again in the '80s and doubled again in 2021. And by 2035 we're projected to be 50% higher on global consumption of energy than we are now. <br/>And by far the largest source of energy is coal, oil and natural gas. <br/>SN: Obviously, it's a divided government. Republicans have a slim majority in the House. Are there things that you think you can work with Democrats on? <br/>BW: The (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) bill on not selling oil to China[3] has huge bipartisan support[4]. <br/>The president went into it calling it a partisan issue. But I think we see it had huge bipartisan support. <br/>Specifically with the Natural Resources Committee, I think there are a lot of things we can work on. When it comes to forestry and natural climate solutions, that can be bipartisan. I think if we get the facts out there, the impact of using U.S. energy versus foreign energy, we could get bipartisan support to do that. <br/>There was a lot of money put out in the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which I think was misnamed, and there was a lot of money put out in the Inflation Reduction Act, which again I think was misnamed. So there's a lot of money out there to build quote green infrastructure. <br/>But people are finding out the green infrastructure people are having the same problems the other kind of infrastructure folks are having, and it's that they can't get a permit. You can't build anything because you can't get a permit. And our laws have been weaponized. <br/>So I think there could be bipartisan support to go in and fix some of these regulations with common sense so that you can build solar farms and transmission lines and you can build pipelines and you can manage a forest and do things that are part of the big equation on how you address climate. <br/>SN: Sen. Joe Manchin III (a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee) had a proposal on that last year. Is that something you'd be interested in revisiting? Or would you all take a different approach to permitting reform? <br/>BW: He and I are supposed to get together here pretty soon and I'm sure we'll talk about permitting. <br/>We've got ideas here in the House. Garret Graves of Louisiana has something called the BUILDER Act[5] that we think has some common-sense reforms in it. <br/>I just saw a story somebody forwarded to me earlier about the number of whales that we think are being harmed by offshore wind [6]energy, so there's a lot of things that we've got to consider and we've got to get the facts and the data and really make a full-faith effort to do what's right. For the country and for the environment and for the future. <br/>SN: You were a forester before you got into politics and I've heard you talk about forest management, and wildfires is of course a huge issue. How do you think the federal approach to forest management could be improved? <br/>BW: Well actually, I'm still a forester. I renewed my license at the end of the year. I'm still a licensed engineer and a licensed forester. <br/>But this is an area that I really hope to see some progress on. A bill that I'm very excited about is one that we call the Save Our Sequoias Act[7]. Worked very closely with Scott Peters, (Democrat) from California on this bill. <br/>Actually, Speaker (Kevin) McCarthy and Scott Peters were the cosponsors of the bill in the last Congress. Most of the sequoia groves are in McCarthy's (California) district. And we went out to look at what's happening in our sequoia groves and how we had lost 20% of these iconic trees in like two or three years. And when you get out and see what the issues are and academics and Forest Service and Park Service employees pointing out that here's the problem: These trees have grown up without fire for over 100 years in an environment where they used to get fire every three years or so. It creates ladder fuel (vegetation that allows a fire to move from a forest floor to tree canopies). <br/>And the result of that is we got a good bill last Congress that had 25 Democrats, 25 Republicans and was endorsed by Save the Redwoods League, the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund. So, I think it requires doing the hard work and really looking at the facts. I'm excited to get that bill filed again. Hopefully we'll get through committee. We couldn't even get a hearing on it in the last Congress. <br/>SN: And how is your approach different from how things have been done? <br/>BW: On this particular bill, it would declare a congressional emergency for the sequoia groves. And they're unique and they're very well-defined. There's like 70 of them and sequoias don't grow off of those sites. <br/>So we are declaring a congressional emergency for all the sequoia groves and we're giving the Park Service and Forest Service \u2014 there's a little bit of tribal ownership of sequoias and a little bit of state of California ownership of sequoias \u2014 but we're giving them the tools and the resources to go in and restore the forest to how it was like in the early 1800s so that they can reintroduce fire to it without destroying the whole forest. And it's following very rigorous science on forest management. <br/>SN: When you restore the forest to its state in the 1800s, is that through thinning? <br/>BW: It requires mechanical thinning. So, what happened after the gold rush in California, Native Americans quit using controlled burns and then the Forest Service came along early 1900s, 1901 or whatever, and they started putting out every fire. <br/>So, you have what's called shade-tolerant species, like white fir and different kinds of pine, that grow very slowly in the understory of these giant sequoias. And what would happen, for centuries, they averaged about 31 fires per century in the sequoia groves. Then it went to three fires per century. <br/>So, these slow-growing trees were over 100 years old, they're pretty good-sized trees, and they got tall enough that the tops of them are in the lower crown of the sequoia. <br/>Then you get wildfire that comes through that then runs up the tree because they've got ladder fuel and it gets into the crowns of the sequoias. And we saw a whole grove of sequoia trees that were totally destroyed by forest fire. <br/>I mean, these things can live to be 3,000 years old Trees are like a history book. Because of their annual rains and fire scars, you can do amazing research on what happened over time. <br/>The simple solution is, you go in and cut down these white fir trees and pine tree that are growing up into the crown of the sequoias. And then you've got it where you can use controlled burns, and the fire goes through low to the ground and cleans up the fuels. And that's the way the forest had been managed for millennia. <br/>SN: OK, we better wrap it up here. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? <br/>BW: We did talk about biochars in passing, so if you want to research that we can have a very in-depth conversation. <br/>SN: Biochar? C-H-A-R? <br/>BW: Yeah, biochar. The Incans were making it over a thousand years ago. And you can still dig it up. And when we talk about carbon sequestration, this gives us a way to remove overstocked vegetation from the forest, make a product out of it that's almost pure carbon. Put it in the soil, make the soil more productive and make renewable fuel out of it in the process. <br/>So that's the kind of innovation I'm talking about when we talk about the big picture of climate. <br/>The post New U.S. House Natural Resources chair opposes limits on fossil fuel development[8] appeared first on Idaho Capital Sun[9]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-outlines-agenda-bid-control-midterms</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china\">https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-legislation-barring-sales-strategic-reserve-oil-china</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2\">https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202331?Page=2</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf\">https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/builder_act_2021_text.pdf</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462\">https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8168/text?r=1&amp;s=1</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/06/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/06/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com\">https://idahocapitalsun.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/02/06/new-u-s-house-natural-resources-chair-opposes-limits-on-fossil-fuel-development/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009854167568693410425876100066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009854</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GR-H081-F03R-N3TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567747</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3710\"/><timeReceived>12:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The fire threatened the power supply to parts of the capital after damaging the transmission network, officials said, adding that fire crews with more than 700 people were working through the night.</p><p>Greek and European Union officials described the huge fires as a consequence of climate change.</p><p>Fueled by the worst heat wave in decades, the blazes drew closer to a summer palace at Tatoi outside Athens once used by the former Greek royal family, as well as a major archaeological site in southern Greece that was the birthplace of the ancient Olympics.</p><p>Late Thursday, officials said both sites appeared to be in no immediate danger.</p><p>\u201cOur priority is always the protection of human life, followed by the protection of property, the natural environment and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, achieving all these aims at the same time is simply impossible,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in an evening televised address. The wildfires, he said, display \u201cthe reality of climate change.\"</p><p>Earlier, he visited Tatoi as well as Ancient Olympia, where flame lighting ceremonies for the modern summer and winter Olympics are held every two years. Earth movers were being used to create big fire breaks around the ancient site.</p><p>As additional support arrived from Greece\u2019s military and EU countries, water-dropping planes and helicopters swooped over blazes near the capital, in central Greece, on the island of Evia, and near Ancient Olympia to the south.</p><p>Ninety-nine new fires were reported while more than 50 villages and settlements were evacuated, including a beachside campsite and hotels on Evia, where boats were used to transport stranded vacationers to safety.</p><p>A heat wave baking southeast Europe for a second week has also triggered deadly fires in Turkey and Albania and blazes across the region.</p><p>North Macedonia\u2019s government on Thursday declared the country in a state of crisis for the next 30 days due to wildfires.</p><p>The EU Commissioner for the environment, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said the fires and extreme weather globally over the summer were a clear signal for the need to address climate change.</p><p>\u201cWe are fighting some of the worst wildfires we\u2019ve seen in decades. But this summer\u2019s floods, heatwaves and forest fires can become our new normality,\u201d he wrote in a tweet.</p><p>\u201cWe must ask ourselves: Is this the world we want to live in? We need immediate actions for nature before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>The EU bolstered assistance from member states and partners to Greece, sending firefighters, water-dropping planes and helicopters from Cyprus, France, Sweden, Romania and Switzerland. Help from the Netherlands and other EU members was also heading to fire-stricken countries in the region.</p><p>In an emergency measure, public access to Greek forests at risk of fire will be limited through Aug. 9.</p><p>Greece\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said the fire threat across southern Greece would increase further Friday, with windy weather forecast for parts of the country despite an expected slight dip in temperatures that reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) earlier this week. The heat wave was described as Greece\u2019s worst since 1987.</p><p>Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos said the armed forces would expand their role in fire prevention, with ground patrols, drones, and aircraft over areas vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>Outside Athens, a forest fire that broke out on the northern fringes of the capital Tuesday and damaged or destroyed scores of homes rekindled, triggering fresh evacuations, threatening homes and sending thick smoke over the capital.</p><p>The EU Atmosphere Monitoring Service said smoke plumes from the region\u2019s wildfires were clearly visible in satellite images, adding that the estimated intensity of the wildfires in Turkey was at the highest level since records started in 2003.</p><p>The fires in Greece have not caused any deaths or serious injuries. But Greek scientists said the total destruction in just three days this month exceeded 50% of the average area burned in the country in previous years. An Athens Observatory report said an estimated 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) went up in smoke between Sunday and Wednesday, compared to 10,400 hectares in the whole of last year.</p><p>The causes of the Greek wildfires were unclear, but authorities say human error and carelessness are most frequently to blame.</p><p>____</p><p>Becatoros reported from Argostoli, Greece.

The fire threatened the power supply to parts of the capital after damaging the transmission network, officials said, adding that fire crews with more than 700 people were working through the night.</p><p>Greek and European Union officials described the huge fires as a consequence of climate change.</p><p>Fueled by the worst heat wave in decades, the blazes drew closer to a summer palace at Tatoi outside Athens once used by the former Greek royal family, as well as a major archaeological site in southern Greece that was the birthplace of the ancient Olympics.</p><p>Late Thursday, officials said both sites appeared to be in no immediate danger.</p><p>\u201cOur priority is always the protection of human life, followed by the protection of property, the natural environment and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately, under these circumstances, achieving all these aims at the same time is simply impossible,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in an evening televised address. The wildfires, he said, display \u201cthe reality of climate change.\"</p><p>Earlier, he visited Tatoi as well as Ancient Olympia, where flame lighting ceremonies for the modern summer and winter Olympics are held every two years. Earth movers were being used to create big fire breaks around the ancient site.</p><p>As additional support arrived from Greece\u2019s military and EU countries, water-dropping planes and helicopters swooped over blazes near the capital, in central Greece, on the island of Evia, and near Ancient Olympia to the south.</p><p>Ninety-nine new fires were reported while more than 50 villages and settlements were evacuated, including a beachside campsite and hotels on Evia, where boats were used to transport stranded vacationers to safety.</p><p>A heat wave baking southeast Europe for a second week has also triggered deadly fires in Turkey and Albania and blazes across the region.</p><p>North Macedonia\u2019s government on Thursday declared the country in a state of crisis for the next 30 days due to wildfires.</p><p>The EU Commissioner for the environment, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said the fires and extreme weather globally over the summer were a clear signal for the need to address climate change.</p><p>\u201cWe are fighting some of the worst wildfires we\u2019ve seen in decades.

We need immediate actions for nature before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>The EU bolstered assistance from member states and partners to Greece, sending firefighters, water-dropping planes and helicopters from Cyprus, France, Sweden, Romania and Switzerland. Help from the Netherlands and other EU members was also heading to fire-stricken countries in the region.</p><p>In an emergency measure, public access to Greek forests at risk of fire will be limited through Aug. 9.</p><p>Greece\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said the fire threat across southern Greece would increase further Friday, with windy weather forecast for parts of the country despite an expected slight dip in temperatures that reached 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) earlier this week. The heat wave was described as Greece\u2019s worst since 1987.</p><p>Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos said the armed forces would expand their role in fire prevention, with ground patrols, drones, and aircraft over areas vulnerable to wildfires.</p><p>Outside Athens, a forest fire that broke out on the northern fringes of the capital Tuesday and damaged or destroyed scores of homes rekindled, triggering fresh evacuations, threatening homes and sending thick smoke over the capital.</p><p>The EU Atmosphere Monitoring Service said smoke plumes from the region\u2019s wildfires were clearly visible in satellite images, adding that the estimated intensity of the wildfires in Turkey was at the highest level since records started in 2003.</p><p>The fires in Greece have not caused any deaths or serious injuries. But Greek scientists said the total destruction in just three days this month exceeded 50% of the average area burned in the country in previous years. An Athens Observatory report said an estimated 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) went up in smoke between Sunday and Wednesday, compared to 10,400 hectares in the whole of last year.</p><p>The causes of the Greek wildfires were unclear, but authorities say human error and carelessness are most frequently to blame.</p><p>____</p><p>Becatoros reported from Argostoli, Greece.

Nearby, an oak seedling sizzled as a yellow-shirted firefighter hit it with a stream of water. Spurts of smoke rose from blackened ground the size of a hockey rink. A 100-foot Ponderosa pine towered overhead.  <br/>'Third response today,' said Savala, shaking his head. <br/>This hillside in my own backyard in California's northern Sierra Nevada mountains hadn't seen lightning for months and yet it had still burst into flames. All summer long, it had baked in heat that extended into an unseasonably hot autumn. Now, in late October, it was charred by a fire of mysterious origin. A spark from a wandering hiker? An errant ember from a burn pile? Spontaneous combustion? <br/>Savala, a fire-crew boss[4] for the Greenville Rancheria of Maidu Indians, scanned the sky. Cloudless. There had only been three inches of precipitation since July 1\u201415 percent of norma[5]l[6]. And no wonder, since California is in the throes of its fourth dry year. More than 95 percent of the state is now classified[7] as under severe or extreme drought. <br/>Although small and easily contained, this tiny fire in rural Northeastern California was another wake-up call, up close and personal, about an ominous trend. A warming planet and changing land use are fueling a dramatic surge in forest fires worldwide. Terrifying projections[8] forecast a 57 percent increase in extreme fires globally by century's end. The indisputable cause: climate change. <br/>'The heating of the planet is turning landscapes into tinderboxes,' a team of 50 researchers from six continents reported in 'Spreading Like Wildfire[8]: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires,' published this year by the United Nations Environment Program. That document describes what can only be viewed as a future flaming version of planetary collapse that could push humanity perilously close to a precipice of no return. <br/>Like dozens of previous reports from the UN and other international organizations, it describes a situation that, while dire, isn't yet hopeless. Despite those ever stronger, hotter, drier winds that will fan the flames, governments could slow climate change by improving their forest management techniques, planning and preparing far better, and communicating more effectively. To reduce the likelihood of future mega-fires means working with forests where fire is an element as essential to ecosystems as sunshine or rain. It also means working with forest communities, where local knowledge accumulated over generations is too often shunned. And of course, it means honestly confronting our reluctance to ween ourselves from the fossil fuels that power our factories, cars, and those absurdly unnecessary leaf blowers that are backing us toward the cliff.  <br/>Current Issue <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-26-2022-january-2-2023/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-26-2022-january-2-2023/</url><br/>A Fiery Feedback Loop <br/>If my small backyard fire was a personal wake-up call, the 2021 Dixie fire was a four-alarm blaze. On its rampage from the Feather River Canyon through Lassen Volcanic National Park and beyond, it destroyed[9] my adopted town of Greenville, 160 miles northeast of San Francisco. In fact, it torched close to a million acres. Nearly half of them burned so intensely that the once-majestic, now blackened pine and fir forests there may never again support the biologically diverse ecosystems that drew me here so long ago. <br/>The single-largest fire in California's history, Dixie was part of a record-breaking fire year globally. Around the world, fires burned nearly 23 million acres, an area almost the size of Portugal. Dixie contributed to the worldwide loss to fire of more than a third of the tree cover that disappeared in those 12 months, according to a report[10] from the World Resources Institute. And this is only a preview of what's to come. Scientists believe that there may be a 30 percent increase in extreme fires globally by 2050. <br/>Such an acceleration of forest fires will, it seems, spare few parts of the world. Fires, burning longer and hotter, are already flaring in unexpected places, shattering assumptions about what's safe, let alone normal. Even the Arctic, that remote expanse of sea ice, treeless permafrost, and minus-40-degree Celsius temperatures, home to polar bears, lemmings, and snowy owls, is now beginning to burn. After July 2019, the hottest month on record[11] so far, fires erupted across the Arctic Circle in Alaska, Greenland, and Siberia. As temperatures soared to as much as six degrees Celsius above normal, flames spurted across an expanse of tundra larger than England. <br/>Arctic fires are particularly worrisome because of the vast amounts of carbon locked beneath that frozen soil. Much of it, after all, is peatlands, largely formed at the end of the last ice age, 12,000 years ago. Although it covers just 3 percent of Earth's surface, peat sequesters 42 percent of the carbon stored in all other types of vegetation, including the world's forests. Global warming is now drying out that peat, making it ever more susceptible to fire. As it burns, of course, it releases that carbon.  <br/>Nor is such a bio-feedback loop limited to the Arctic. As the world becomes hotter and drier, the carbon we emit from our reliance on fossil fuels is drying out forests everywhere, making them ever more prone to burn, while extending burning seasons globally. Firefighters in California used to don fire-resistant Nomex shirts in May or June, knowing they could shed them by mid-October. Now, there's barely a pause before things heat up again and those shirts go right back on. <br/>As wildfires are transformed into year-round challenges, the carbon they release only further contributes to emissions from other sources, making it that much more difficult to halt rising temperatures. Think of it as a mutually exacerbating feedback loop: Wildfires are worsened by climate change, which, in turn, is intensified by the ever-fiercer wildfires.  <br/>Management for Better\u2014or Worse <br/>Forests around the world evolved with fire, hosting species that came to depend on its cleansing power for renewal and the flushes of nutrients it releases. Indigenous people understood this and learned to live with fire. Over the last century, however, many forests have been fundamentally altered by a misunderstanding of its essential role in forest resilience. While climate change is indeed the primary driver of the global increase in wildfires, forest management has played its own substantive and mostly negative role in that increase by overemphasizing the importance of fire suppression. <br/>Scientists and policymakers are urging fire-fighting agencies to rethink their use of financial and human resources. Instead of focusing primarily on how many crews can be mustered for fire suppression, the emphasis should shift to planning and prevention. Most countries devote less than 0.2 percent of their wildfire expenditures to such planning, according to UN researchers. In the United States, just 40 cents of every dollar spent on managing wildfires goes toward reducing fire risk or helping forest communities like mine recover in ways that could make them more resilient. <br/>'There isn't the right attention to fire from governments,' says Glynis Humphrey, a fire expert at the University of Cape Town and one of those UN researchers. <br/>Whether it's the collapse of forest ecosystems before our eyes or the trauma of entire towns like Greenville burning up in raging infernos, forest managers are slowly starting to respond to the global crisis\u2014with sadly mixed results. <br/>A wave of deadly fires in Portugal in 2017 that killed 117 people and ravaged 1.3 million acres evoked fierce popular condemnation of the government's response, prompting that country to adopt an aggressive 20-year plan[12] to transform its fire management. It aims to use fire as a tool, while increasing understanding of its positive role in such a heavily forested country. Prime Minister Antonio Costa has restricted funding aimed at combatting fires to less than 10 percent of the total spent, while rural communities are to become more involved in protecting their homes and businesses. However, his new plan was barely launched last summer when temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and 40-mile-per-hour winds contributed to yet another series of out-of-control wildfires, forcing evacuations of whole communities and a nationwide state of emergency. <br/>Throughout the Western United States, a century of public policy committed to suppressing all wildfire has left our forests unnaturally crammed with small-diameter trees and brush. Scientists documented[13] as much as a sevenfold increase in tree density in the Sierra mountains between 1911 and 2011. While large old-growth trees have evolved to live with fires, those small trees and shrubs form an unnatural bed of fuel for future infernos. As a result, blazes in the West increased by seven large fires a year from the mid-1980s through 2011, according to a study[14] by scientists at the University of Utah and the University of California, Berkeley. <br/>What needs to be done is clear, says Scott Stephens, a professor of fire science at Berkeley. 'Active stewardship is the only way we'll ever get out of this.' <br/>In California, state and federal officials have committed to reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires by returning fire to the forest ecosystems that evolved with it. They've set a goal of igniting planned fires to burn away such brush and seedlings on one million acres annually. In September 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation allocating $1.5 billion to wildfire mitigation projects, the largest such investment in state history. Last January, the federal government also announced a $600 million program[15] to support California's wildfire recovery efforts. As well-intentioned as such programs may be, however, they have so far fallen well short of their objective. Fire managers hope that, in 2022, they will have set prescribed burns on 200,000 acres, only 20 percent of the goal. Add in logging to thin overcrowded stands of trees and they may reach 300,000 acres. <br/>Amid the frightening statistics on rising temperatures and scorched acres, an 8,800-acre area in California demonstrates the potential for active management[16] to reduce the dangers of destructive wildfires. In 2019, Forest Service crews set intentional fires on the western slopes of the central Sierra Nevada near Caples Lake. Last summer, when the 222,000-acre Caldor fire[17] roared through there en route to South Lake Tahoe, it left a finger of green where prescribed fires had reduced the forest's fuels. While that was only a small island of resilience, consider it an enormous example of possibility. <br/>The Promise of Technology <br/>Some of the government agencies most criticized for their management of wildfires are now turning to technology to help detect them before they turn into infernos. In this, they are not alone globally. Take Australia, where fires in the catastrophic 2019-2020 summer season, the worst in that country's recorded history, killed 34 people directly and another 445 through smoke inhalation. Often sparked by lightning at a time of warmer-than-average temperatures and lower-than-average precipitation, they destroyed about 6,000 buildings and killed an estimated 1.5 billion animals. In response, last year, Australia launched a satellite system[18] connected to ground-based cameras and aerial drones meant to spot any fire within one minute of ignition. <br/>Sonoma County, California, has similarly been testing fire-detecting artificial intelligence technology for two years now. In 2017, that area just north of San Francisco was devastated by the deadly 37,000-acre Tubbs fire. Three other fires followed in 2019 and 2020. In 2021, county officials linked artificial intelligence software[19] to an already existing system of tower-mounted cameras. Called ALERTWildfire[20], it snaps photographs every 10 seconds, exposing smoke and flames. The AI sifts through the camera images in a fashion designed to increase the speed of detecting such blazes and so getting firefighters to them faster. <br/>After the first full season, the results, however, were anything but overwhelming: AI detections beat humans in spotting fires only once out of every 10 times. Now, managers are directing their AI-adapted cameras to look for fires where humans are unlikely to spot them\u2014as Sam Wallis, a community alert and warning manager, put it: the fires 'way out in the middle of nowhere, the ones that really scare us.' He's also optimistic about AI's potential for detecting nighttime fires, which can smolder in the forest duff for significant periods before bursting into uncontrollable flames. Overall, Wallis said, 'the AI is not a silver bullet, but it is a bullet.' <br/>Last year, Pacific Gas and Electric[21] also began adding AI software similar to the kind Australia is testing to its network of cameras. It's a better-late-than-never effort to reduce the number of deadly wildfires sparked all too notoriously by its own faulty equipment. The company has, after all, been implicated[22] in at least five major California wildfires[23] including the Dixie one. <br/>Then there are the 'dragon eggs[24].' The Forest Service is dropping those ping-pong-sized balls from remote-controlled aircraft to start controlled burns designed to return fire to its natural role of keeping forest fuels more balanced. The chemicals in the spheres ignite when they hit the ground. During the Dixie fire, drones dropped such incendiary balls on a mountainside ahead of the advancing flames to start what's known as a backfire and did indeed create a fire-unfriendly zone in its wake. <br/>Such management efforts may prove effective both in returning forest stands to a state of fire resilience and in curbing runaway blazes. They don't, however, relieve officials of what many consider their unconscionable failure to enact the most basic laws to curb the greenhouse gases that are driving such climate-change-induced disasters. Apocalyptic scenes\u2014cities blanketed in smoke, vast landscapes left lifeless\u2014have prompted proposals[25] before the UN to include 'ecocide' as the 5th international crime, alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression. <br/>Sadly, humanity may already have passed the point of simply managing ourselves out of the fiery apocalypse scientists predict we're heading for. Global mean surface temperatures are already up 1.09 degrees Celsius and rising. The precipice looms. <br/>Yes, technology can help and, if the feet of agencies are held to the proverbial flames they're committed to managing more effectively, the oncoming inferno may yet be slowed, if not halted altogether. But if we don't take responsibility for what's happening, all our talk, all that bureaucratic lingo about creating a low-carbon economy and hitting net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 may be little more than what environmental activist Greta Thunberg[26] has called the 'blah blah blah.' <br/>Still, hope is empowering and activity galvanizing. While it's taken far too many destroyed towns to get there, California, at least, is beginning to grasp what's needed to live with fire. Both cultural and monetary support is now strong\u2014and growing\u2014for prescribed burns and fuel-treatment projects. And so, locally, we take chainsaws to the smaller trees overcrowding our woods, using what we remove to heat our homes. We prune the branches from the large fire-resilient trees, chopping them to fit our stoves. We rake the small debris and forest litter into burn piles, wishing we had a way to utilize those forest products, too, instead of adding to the very emissions we're trying to reduce. And we keep on igniting small, safe burns to return resilience to these lands that once enjoyed the benefits of fire. On such a planet in such a time, the question remains: Will any of it be enough to live with the fire next time? <br/>Days after our backyard blaze flared up, it snowed: eight inches of reassurance that this fire, at least, would not smolder and restart. But by the end of November, the Sierra had no additional rain and state officials were at the edge of declaring a fourth year of drought. Somewhere in our future, the inferno still lurks. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com\">http://www.tomdispatch.com</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://eepurl.com/lsFRj\">http://eepurl.com/lsFRj</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue\">https://www.thenation.com/issue</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.grth.org/history\">https://www.grth.org/history</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ggweather.com/seasonal_rain.htm\">https://www.ggweather.com/seasonal_rain.htm</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ggweather.com/seasonal_rain.htm\">https://www.ggweather.com/seasonal_rain.htm</url>.

I hope and believe this book will help people to do that with new-found resolve.\"<br/><br/>Yohannan's previous books include Revolution in World Missions -- which launched a groundbreaking movement of supporting national workers and has more than four million copies in print.<br/><br/>In Never Give Up (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nevergiveupbook.org/\">www.nevergiveupbook.org</url>), 70-year-old Yohannan openly discusses a grueling four-year legal battle and how it drove him to the depths of despair. Yohannan describes how great trials produce perseverance -- and how he emerged from his brokenness inspired to show God's love to a new generation.<br/><br/>The Choice: Not to Give Up<br/>\"The choice not to give up is mine -- and it is also yours,\" says Yohannan in Never Give Up. \"I am certain you, too, have gone through, or are even now going through, your own Gethsemane,\" Yohannan says, referring to the garden where Jesus agonized before his death. \"Please believe me, the sun will rise. Hold on. Let us not forget God's unchanging promise, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you'\" (Hebrews 13:5, NKJV).<br/><br/>Calling Yohannan a leader with \"a pure heart, great passion and vision,\" George Verwer, founder of Operation Mobilization (OM) International, described Never Give Up as a \"history-making\" account that will inspire and help others during troubled times in their lives.<br/><br/>\"Without question, GFA is one of the greatest works of God in our generation,\" said Verwer.<br/><br/>'Brutally Honest'<br/>Calling Never Give Up \"brutally honest and refreshingly candid,\" Skip Heitzig, senior pastor of Calvary Albuquerque, said: \"I've known K.P. Yohannan for three decades. I've seen him in great triumph, and I watched him endure in great pain. His passion for untold millions of people is undeniable, and his passion for honoring Christ is equally so.\"<br/><br/>Like the lion Aslan, a \"Christ figure\" in C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, God shows up to encourage people during their most desperate moments, Yohannan says in Never Give Up.<br/><br/>\"When you walk through grief and pain, you will see the Invisible One, and he will see you through,\" said India-born Yohannan, whose ambitious vision is to bring physical and spiritual hope to 500,000 of Asia's poorest children.<br/><br/>\"One of the most encouraging things the Lord has said to me is: 'At the end of your journey, I am going to be there, and you are going to meet me,'\" Yohannan said.<br/><br/>Published by GFA Books, Never Give Up can be pre-ordered at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nevergiveupbook.org/\">www.nevergiveupbook.org</url>.

Doctor, it`s good to see you again. Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL OSTERHOLM (University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research &amp; Policy Director): Thank you. It`s good to be with you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So, let me ask you about what`s happening there in South Dakota. More than half a million people are expected to attend. What are your concerns?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well, anytime we bring a group of people like that together, they are going to spend time indoors. It`s just a matter of whether in the bars, the tattoo parlors, or the casinos. And as we saw last year with Sturgis, we actually had a substantial number of cases tied to Sturgis, then were brought home to their various states. And then we saw more transmission in those states from the people who came back from Sturgis. So we have every reason to believe that this year is going to be just as bad, if not worse. And on top it, right now, as you know, people are really feeling pretty well done with this virus in many locations of the country. The fact of the matter is, the virus isn`t done with us. We have state fairs that are about to be held that will bring in two million people to various locations. We have lots of festivals that are being held this year. So, this is the month, I think right now, these events that are going to unfortunately occur at the same time that this virus is surging.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Let me ask you about the Biden administration`s plan to prioritize authorizing a booster shot for immunocompromised individuals. People wonder when they`re going to be able to get their shots. How soon do you think this should happen?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well, we have a conflict going on right now that is normal, natural, and unfortunate. And what I mean by that is that just two days ago, the World Health Organization put out a plea for a moratorium on any booster shots around the world, because of the fact countries like ours that have had two doses available for virtually everyone, whereas of the 6.4 billion people living in low and middle-income countries, less than one to two percent have had access to vaccine at all. And so the world is asking us not to do booster shots inside the country. Those of-- for those individuals who are still susceptible because they haven`t had an adequate response to the first two shots are begging for their booster shot. So we`ve got this tension going on. I`m not sure how it will ultimately be decided. Someday, there`s no question in my mind, boosters will be given, and the question is just how soon that that`s going to happen.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Doctor, you said something the other day that got my attention. These are your words: \"This virus will find you, it will infect you eventually.\" It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck, because you said it with such certainty. Can you elaborate a little bit on that and why it`s so really scary for children?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Well, Gayle, as you know, this virus has only continued to become more and more transmissible or more infectious. Over the course of the last eighteen months, we`ve had these mutations occur, and each one of them, unfortunately, related to transmissions, have only made the virus more infectious. Now we have a situation, as you`re seeing, you can go for months in a given location with little activity and then you see these big surges occur. And what happens is people feel like they`re out of the woods. You know, I keep telling people, don`t think you can run out the game clock. It`s not going to happen. Ultimately, this virus will keep circulating until it finds you. And I think the story that you had on just before this one on, the forest fire, is basically one of great similarities. This fire-- fire will find that-- those trees, that forest to burn eventually. That`s what this virus is going to do with us as humans.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That is frightening.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s a visual.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yeah, it is, indeed. Doctor Michael Osterholm. Thank you, Sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM: Thank you very much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBSNEW-2021080603cb410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBSNEW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63B3-40R1-DXH2-63YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 CBS Worldwide Inc.

In Moscow, there's usually a healthy amount of snow already on the ground.</p><p>However, as these seasonal sensations begin to come back into our lives, we must remember that we are still in an ever-changing and odd time in our history, with COVID-19 cases continuing to rise throughout our town, state and country.</p><p>This, on top of our personal lives, work and the upcoming election, has created a stress cocktail that we all want to pour down the drain.</p><p>We are all wanting to get back to our normal way of life, and we have an opportunity to have a taste of it, but only if everyone does their part to ensure we all stay safe.</p><p>Whether you're a kid going stir crazy from staying at home these last few months, a college student missing the college experience or someone else just wanting to get out of the house, do not throw caution to the wind.</p><p>The temptation to go out and live a night of ignorant bliss is appealing, but we must refrain from this because one night of fun is not worth a spike in cases &amp; a large setback to our fight against COVID-19.</p><p>Whether you are taking the kiddos out trick-or-treating or get invited to a Halloween costume party with friends, please keep the safety of both yourself and others in mind.</p><p>If you are going to set out candy for those who trick-or-treat, try individual plastic bags rather than the traditional candy in a bowl, or maybe wait at the door to hand it out yourself.</p><p>If you are looking for some fun with friends, keep it small and to people you know rather than the normal big blowouts.</p><p>Or spend the evening alone or with friends watching scary movies and carving pumpkins to get into the spooky vibe.</p><p>Some Main Street residents said they plan to throw their black cat a birthday party with their family.</p><p>But if you do decide to go out trick-or-treating, get a drink at the bars or have a party, consider what the safest options are. Limit your exposure to new people and high-traffic or close-quarters locations.</p><p>The spread of the virus is like a forest fire. All it takes is a single spark to light a pile of kindling and have it spread out of control.

These transferred climate change mitigation outcomes are a specific type of carbon credit, referred to as Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (\"ITMOs\"). Rules for parties wishing to enter into ITMO transactions are starting to emerge. These rules, along with ITMO transactions that parties are entering into, provide guidance on how countries can work across national borders to achieve greater ambition in reducing their GHG emissions or removing GHGs from the atmosphere. </p><p><br/> Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement <br/> Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement provides a decentralized framework for countries that are parties to the Paris Agreement to enter into bilateral or multilateral arrangements, known as \"cooperative approaches.\"1 These arrangements are intended to facilitate the transfer of one country's GHG emissions reductions or removals to other countries seeking to use those reductions or removals. Countries can use these reductions or removals towards their own contribution to the global response to climate change under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement, referred to as Nationally Determined Contributions (\"NDCs\"), or for other purposes.2 The GHG emission reductions or removals transferred under Article 6.2 are a specific type of carbon credit known as ITMOs.3 <br/><br/>The country procuring ITMOs under Article 6.2 is the \"host country\" in which the project or activity giving rise to the GHG emission reductions or removals is based. For host countries procuring ITMOs, often based in the Global South, ITMOs transactions are an innovative way to channel investments into low-carbon projects that contribute to their sustainable development.4 For the receiving country, ITMOs transactions enable it to take on greater ambition in setting its NDC by allowing it to finance projects or activities in geographic locations where GHG emissions reductions or removals can be achieved in an more cost-effective manner.5 Alternatively, receiving countries may choose not to count the ITMOs towards their NDC, but may instead use them to complement their NDC.6 <br/><br/>In line with the incremental approach of the international climate change regime, the Paris Agreement laid out a high-level framework for engagement in \"cooperative approaches\" under Article 6.2, leaving most of the details as to how this would work in practice to be agreed at each subsequent session of the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") serving as a Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.7 Initial rules on the functioning of Article 6.2 were tabled at the 26th session of the COP (\"COP26\") in 2021,8 and further progress was made at the 27th session of the COP (\"COP27\") in 2022.9 <br/> Key requirements for ITMOs transactions <br/> While Article 6.2 leaves it open for countries to tailor their cooperative approaches to the particular circumstances of each case, the guidelines agreed at COP26 and COP27 (collectively, the \"Article 6 Rulebook\") lay down certain rules which countries must comply with in structuring these arrangements.10 <br/><br/>In particular, the Article 6 Rulebook establishes an accounting framework in respect of Article 6.2 which is designed to avoid double-counting GHG reductions or removals by requiring countries to apply what are known as \"corresponding adjustments\" when transferring ITMOs.11 To prevent double-counting, the project host country is required to deduct the transferred GHG emission reductions or removals from its own inventory upon transferring ITMOs to another country.12 Where the receiving country is authorized to count the ITMOs towards its NDC, it will also apply a corresponding adjustment.13 <br/><br/>In their reporting, countries must also include information on how each cooperative approach meets certain social and environmental standards.14 These include demonstrating that the cooperative approaches do not lead to an increase in global GHG emissions, that conservative baselines are adopted,15 and that the risk of non-permanence16 of mitigation outcomes over the long term is minimized.17 Countries must also report on how cooperative approaches minimize, and where possible avoid, negative environmental, economic and social impacts, and how cooperative approaches are consistent with and contribute to sustainable development.18 <br/><br/>ITMOs must also satisfy requirements that claimed GHG emission reductions or removals are \"real, verified and additional\".19 The principle of \"additionality\" requires that ITMOs should only be transferred in respect of GHG emission reductions or removals that would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives created by the carbon credit revenues.20 <br/> Structuring of ITMOs transactions <br/> Article 6.2 aims to facilitate cooperative approaches between countries, which typically sign bilateral agreements for the transfer of ITMOs.21 Governments can also agree for companies to trade ITMOs within the overarching frameworks established by these agreements, thus creating opportunities for private sector participation in ITMOs transactions.22 In this scenario, ITMOs transactions would have a two-tier structure: <br/><br/> Bilateral governmental agreement. Bilateral governmental agreements, usually referred to as a \"Cooperation Agreements\" or \"Implementing Agreements\", are signed between the project host country in which the activity giving rise to the GHG emission reduction or removals is based, and the country which will receive the ITMOs.23This sets out the framework for cooperation between the two countries, within which transactions for the transfer of ITMOs (including private sector transactions) can be agreed.24The governmental agreement sets out minimum quality criteria which ITMOs transferred under the framework must satisfy in relation to the environment, human rights and contributing to sustainable development.25In addition, the agreement sets out the agreed government procedure for authorizing, verifying and recognizing the transfer of ITMOs, for applying corresponding adjustments, and for reporting on their cooperative approaches.26 Commercial agreements. Within the framework established by the bilateral governmental agreement, third parties may sign commercial agreements for transferring ITMOs in respect of particular projects.27These agreements set out the relevant commercial terms for each ITMOs transaction, including the number of credits to be transferred, the payment structure and pricing.28The transfer of ITMOs under the commercial agreement is conditional on authorization of the proposed activity or project by the countries that are party to the overarching bilateral agreement.29The governments that are party to the bilateral agreement will not generally be parties to the commercial agreement. The exception to this is if the mitigation project is owned or the mitigation outcomes are sold by the project host country government, in which case that government may be a party to the agreement - and may directly sell ITMOs to the relevant private entity.30 <br/><br/>For example, the framework established by the bilateral agreement between Switzerland and Peru expressly recognizes that ITMOs can be used by private entities domiciled in Switzerland or Peru. Pursuant to this framework, the Swiss Foundation for Climate Protection and Carbon Offset (\"KliK Foundation\") entered into a commercial agreement with Microsol S.A.S. (a French company with subsidiaries in Peru) to support the use of energy efficient cook-stoves in Peru.31 Through this arrangement, the KliK Foundation acquires ITMOs on behalf of certain corporations that are required to offset GHG emissions generated by the use of motor fuels under the Swiss CO2 Act.32 The KliK Foundation is involved in similar projects in Georgia, Malawi, Peru and Senegal, among other countries.33 <br/> The procedure for ITMOs transactions <br/> In terms of procedure, ITMOs transactions typically involve the following steps: <br/><br/> Authorization. Authorization of ITMOs is required under Article 6.2.34The entity wishing to issue ITMOs in respect of a particular activity in the host country submits a request for authorization to both countries that are party to the bilateral agreement.35Both countries must then agree to an authorization statement referencing the activity in respect of which the mitigation outcomes originate, the standards and baseline methodologies applied, the crediting period, the maximum amount of mitigation outcomes in respect of which transfer and use is authorized, and, where applicable, the NDC period(s) during which the ITMOs are authorized for use.36Once both countries have agreed the authorization statement, the transfer of mitigation outcomes is authorized.37 Monitoring, verification and examination. The entity developing the mitigation activity in the project host country is responsible for preparing monitoring reports demonstrating that the activity meets various requirements, including in relation to social and sustainable development impacts, which it submits to an independent third-party entity approved by each country to the bilateral agreement for the purposes of verifying the reports.38Once verified, each country must examine the verified monitoring reports to confirm that all relevant requirements are met, including that there are no discrepancies between the monitoring reports and the provisions of the authorization statement.39 Recognition of transfer. In order for the transfer of ITMOs to be carried out, both countries which are party to the bilateral agreement issue domestic units in respect of the mitigation outcomes in their respective registries.40Following this, the project host country cancels the units in its domestic registry system, while simultaneously, the receiving country will re-issue the cancelled units as \"international attestations\" in its registry.41If any third party entities are involved in the purchase of the ITMOs (for example, in the case study mentioned above, the KliK Foundation), they are issued to such third party upon \"recognition\" by both countries that the mitigation outcomes have been added to the receiving country's registry.42 Corresponding adjustment. Once both countries have issued domestic units for tradable or transferred mitigation outcomes, the final step is for both countries to apply the respective corresponding adjustment, which is to be reported by the countries.43This effectively involves the project host country deducting the transferred GHG emission reductions or removals from its own inventory, so that the receiving country can count them in their own GHG inventory.44 <br/><br/>In addition, countries participating in cooperative approaches are required to prepare various reports on their activities under Article 6.2. These include: (i) an initial report, to be submitted no later than authorization of ITMOs or in conjunction with the next biennial transparency report,45 (ii) annual information for recording in the Article 6 database,46 and (iii) other regular information to be included as an annex to biennial transparency reports.47 The information on cooperative approaches set out in these reports is subject to a centralized technical expert review overseen by the UNFCCC to ensure that the information provided by participants meets the requirements set out in the COP guidelines.48 <br/> ITMOs transactions to date <br/> Although still in its infancy, various countries have agreed frameworks to enter into \"cooperative approaches\" under Article 6.2. In particular, Switzerland has committed to purchasing ITMOs from countries including Ghana, Peru, Senegal, Georgia and Vanuatu, among others.49 In addition, Singapore has concluded Article 6.2 agreements with countries including Ghana,50 Peru,51 Papua New Guinea52 and Japan.53 Likewise, Sweden, acting through the Swedish Energy Agency, has agreed to acquire ITMOs from countries including Ghana,54 and is collaborating with the Global Green Growth Institute to transact ITMOs with Nepal55 and Cambodia.56 Other countries, including South Korea and Vietnam, have also entered into bilateral agreements to transfer ITMOs,57 while further countries, such as Gabon and the Kingdom of Bhutan, have set out an intention to do so.58 Japan has launched the \"Article 6 Implementation Partnership\", which aims to support the implementation of Article 6.2 by sharing best practices and know-how.59 <br/><br/>Ghana is at the forefront of host countries seeking to enter into cooperative approaches under Article 6.2,60 having recently announced an Article 6.2 project, which aims to support training rice farmers in sustainable agricultural practices and reduce methane emissions.61 <br/> ITMOs transactions going forward <br/> Despite these recent forays into ITMOs transactions, challenges for expanded implementation exist. <br/><br/>Uncertainties and risks remain for private sector entities involved in ITMOs transactions. In particular, private sector entities which have acquired ITMOs face the risk that the governmental parties to the agreement will not carry out the corresponding adjustments which they are required to under the Article 6.2 rules.62 In such a scenario, it is unclear how the status and value of the credits would be affected by the corresponding adjustments not having been carried out.63 <br/><br/>Another area of uncertainty relates to the fact that, according to the Article 6 guidance, ITMOs cannot be banked between NDC implementation periods.64 This creates a risk that the supply of ITMOs could dry up near the end of the NDC period, causing liquidity issues and presenting challenges for countries or entities wishing to sell ITMOs.65 <br/><br/>There are also uncertainties regarding how, or if, ITMOs can be operationalized within existing mandatory emissions trading schemes, such as the EU's Emissions Trading System. The EU and Switzerland have announced that they intend to enable the transfer of emission allowances between their respective emissions trading systems using the Article 6.2 mechanism,66 but questions remain as to how this will be achieved.67 <br/><br/>In addition, general macroeconomic trends may also hamper the expansion of ITMOs transactions. Borrowing costs have risen, but debt financing remains the dominant form of financing in sustainable finance markets. Climate change mitigation projects must compete for financing with resurgent demand for fossil fuel projects in emerging market and developing economies.68 <br/><br/>Despite these uncertainties and risks, cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 are likely to become increasingly common over the coming years. At COP27, some details were agreed regarding infrastructure needed to support Article 6.2, including registries, an Article 6 database, and a centralized accounting and reporting platform, but some of the necessary infrastructure is still to be created.69 Additional procedural issues, including those related to granting authorization of ITMOs and what process a country should follow to manage changes to how an ITMO is used, will likely be considered at the 58th sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice in June 2023, and at the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in November and December 2023. <br/> Further reading <br/><br/> 1 This is to be contrasted with the more centralized framework for the creation of a global carbon credit market under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement, overseen by a \"Supervisory Body\" that is to be appointed by the Conference of Parties serving at the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (the \"CMA\"). 2Paris Agreement, Articles 4.2 and 6.2, available here[1]; \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, available here[2]. 3 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, available here[2]. 4\"Frequently Asked Questions on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and Internationally Transferred Mitigation Options (ITMOs)\", United Nations Development Programme, available here[3].

See \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, available here[2]. 9 With regard to Article 6.4, guidance was agreed at COP27 in relation to the implementation of registries (including national registries to be set up by countries, and an international registry to be set up by the secretariat), the creation of a centralized accounting and reporting platform and an Article 6 database, as well as guidelines in respect of the Article 6 technical expert review. See \"Matters relating to cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Draft decision -/CMA.4, available here[5]. 10 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, available here[2]. 11 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 6, available here[2]. 12 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraphs 7 - 15, available here[2]. 13 By contrast, where the ITMOs have been authorized other than for NDC use, such as for \"other international mitigation purposes\" (including CORSIA-use) or for \"other purposes\" (such as use in the voluntary carbon markets), the receiving country is not required to apply a corresponding adjustment. The selling country, on the other hand, must apply a corresponding adjustment in all circumstances. See \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 1 and Section III.B, available here[2]. 14 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 22, available here[2]. 15 The \"baseline\" calculation represents what the GHG emissions would have been if the activity giving rise to the mitigation outcome had not been implemented. For example, if carbon credits are issued in respect of a carbon capture, utilization and storage project, the baseline analysis calculates the GHG emissions which would have been released but for the implementation of the project. 16 Non-permanence refers to the risk of GHG emission reductions or removals achieved by an activity being reversed, for example if there is a forest fire or other unforeseen circumstance. In addition, it refers more broadly to situations where GHG emissions in respect of a particular activity rise above the level that was projected in the baseline scenario analysis, meaning that the estimated GHG emission reductions or removals are overstated. 17 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 22(b), available here[2]. 18 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 22(f) and (h), available here[2]. 19 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 1(a), available here[2]. 20 Although the term \"additional\" is not defined in the Article 6.2 guidance, the definition of additionality in the guidance on Article 6.4 is likely to be authoritative.

The project is being developed in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (\"UNDP\"), which channels payments to private sector project proponents investing in low-carbon solutions using a \"payment-for-result\" mechanism. This mechanism incentivizes private sector investments by creating additional revenue for ITMOs and reducing risk. UNDP estimates that for projects under this mechanism, private sector investments will be equivalent to up to four times the carbon payments generated by ITMOs. Thus the additional funding from UNDP serves to make these investments bankable. 62 As explained above, the transfer of ITMOs to private sector entities occurs upon 'recognition' by both countries that the ITMOs have been added to the receiving countries registry, rather than upon the countries carrying out corresponding adjustments. See \"Article 6 Transaction Structures\", World Bank et al., 21 April 2022, section 3.1.2, pp.6-7, available here[6]. 63 \"Article 6 Transaction Structures\", World Bank et al., 21 April 2022, section 3.1.2, p.7, available here[6]. 64 \"Guidance on cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement\", Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraphs 8 - 9, available here[2]. 65 The underlying rationale for this rule is to incentivize countries to work towards the achievement of their NDC through direct GHG emission reductions or removals in their own jurisdictions, rather than relying on the carbon markets. However, certain policy makers have called on the UNFCCC to consider changing the rules under Article 6 so as to allow the banking of ITMOs between NDC implementation periods, on the basis that this would greatly facilitate the use of the Article 6 trading mechanism.

We've seen the smoke that has come all the way to us from California from those wildfires burning there.\"</p><p>The agency conducts computer modeling to gauge how the fires will burn and where the smoke will drift, with on eye on avoiding population centers, she said. The agency manages prescribed fires in compliance with state air quality regulations, Overton said.</p><p>Those who are smoke-sensitive or have heart and lung ailments should take health precautions during a prescribed burn, she said.</p><p>One example of a prime resource that faces high fire danger is the Santa Fe watershed, which encompasses the McClure and Nichols reservoirs and supplies a high portion of the area's water.</p><p>A 350-acre burn is proposed for the watershed.</p><p>\"We completely support the prescribed fires that the national forests are conducting,\" said Anne Bradley, forest program director for Nature Conservancy's New Mexico chapter. \"We think it's a great way for our forests to be more healthy, resilient and reduce the risk of damaging wildfires.\" She noted previous prescribed burns helped keep last year's Medio Fire from spreading to the ski basin.</p><p>A wildfire is not only destructive while it burns but leads to erosion, flooding and debris flows on scorched, denuded hillsides, she said. Officials are concerned about what the impacts would be on the municipal watershed, Bradley said.</p><p>\"They're really concerned about debris coming into the reservoir - and the debris filling up the reservoir,\" she said, noting that scenario would reduce water storage.</p><p>Krasilovsky said well-managed, low-intensity fire is one of the best ways to enable the forests to better withstand drought and a changing climate.</p><p>\"It raises the importance of maintaining these efforts so we can be ready as we can be for the hotter, drier future,\" he said.</p><p> More Information</p><p>Here are the proposed prescribed burns for the Santa Fe National Forest.

Welcome to CNN THIS MORNING. It is Sunday, April 16th. I'm Victor Blackwell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Amarillo walker. Thank you so much for spending a part of your Sunday with us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is what we are watching for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congress returns from recess this week with a laundry list of to do items. Among them, coming up with a plan to fund the government, to look at other major priorities for both parties in the coming days.</p><p>BLACKWELL: At least 56 people are dead in Sudan. There were explosions throughout the night clashes between the military and armed group they're escalating now. What we know about how this started and the response from the U.S. and other countries.</p><p>WALKER: Hundreds of Atlanta area inmates are being moved as a jail deals with an outbreak of infectious illnesses. The measures being taken to address the problems, plus how one man's family says those conditions contributed to his death.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Boston marathon's tomorrow, with this year's race marking 10 years since the deadly bombing. We're joined by a survivor who's turned that trauma into a cause to help others.</p><p>We're starting in Washington. The debt ceiling deadline just one of the major issues facing Congress when members return this week. President Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they are locked in a standoff over raising the debt limit, and Biden's message to McCarthy is: show me your budget, McCarthy is holding a conference call with House Republicans today ahead of a speech tomorrow at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>CNN reporter Alayna Treene has more on the week ahead for McCarthy and Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Good morning, Victor and Amara. The first big priority for Congress is the debt ceiling. Current estimates put the deadline for when the treasury department will exhaust the extraordinary measures that uses to pay the government's bills at some point early this summer. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have yet to hold substantial negotiations on this something that has become a key point of anxiety for many members on Capitol Hill.</p><p>House Republican leaders I'm told have begun informally putting together a debt limit package that they intend to socialize with their rank and file members next week. McCarthy is also slated to deliver a speech on this at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.</p><p>Another key priority on the Hill will be around receiving classified briefings. The Pentagon is scheduled to give an all senators briefing on Wednesday as they continue to investigate the massive leak of classified defense documents.</p><p>The Gang of Eight, which includes the top four congressional leaders, as well as the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees started receiving some of the classified documents found at the homes and offices of former President Donald Trump, President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence in recent weeks. They're eager to review these documents more closely in a classified setting on the Hill.</p><p>Another key focus for Congress is on the recent abortion ruling in Texas. There's little that Congress can do following the court's decision to suspend the use of medication, abortion drugs, but Democrats in particular are eager to weigh in on this in person and see what legislation including messaging bills they can put forward to force Republicans on the record.</p><p>And lastly, House investigations are continuing to heat up. We're seeing more Republican chairman begin to issue subpoenas as they enter into the fourth month of being in the majority. On Monday, the house judiciary committee will hold a field hearing in New York city as they continue to escalate their investigation into Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLACKWELL: Alayna Treene, thank you so much for the reporting.</p><p>Let's get now. Some insight from Nicholas Wu, congressional reporter for \"Politico\".</p><p>Nicholas, good morning to you.</p><p>I want to read just a line here from the letter that the chair of Republican Study Committee sent out to his colleagues at the Republicans in the House: Passage of a strong debt limit bill before the end of the April legislative session, must be the chamber's top priority. We must work night and day to get it passed to show the American people that we can be trusted. Are the Republicans any closer to coalescing around a list of substantial cuts that they need to see in order to vote for debt limit increase?</p><p>NICHOLAS WU, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Well, as my colleagues have reported, the devil is really in the details there for what exactly Republicans want to get together as they figure out everything they want to try to extract in exchange for raising the debt limit.</p><p>But the problem for Republicans is that you have a number of members who helped them make the majority who are from districts that are more blue, were won by President Biden in 2022 -- is in 2020 rather and are not necessarily the kinds of places that look favorably upon big spending cuts or potential cuts to the Pentagon as some Republicans have proposed, or even stricter work requirements for things like food stamps and other thing that conservatives have floated.</p><p>So, but -- you know, the Republicans are trying to move very quickly on this, but the same time getting something together that all of them can call us or not is going to be very hard.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Yeah, this is legislation that must pass. I think everyone agrees that defaulting on the debt would be catastrophic. When that happens is hard to nail down, some say as early as June, Moody's said maybe about August, most people agreed during the summer.</p><p>[08:05:00]</p><p>As this drags on, how much does that I guess, undermine, or maybe make the ability of McCarthy to hold on to leadership difficult? How much is this -- the fate of this fight tied to his ability to lead?</p><p>WU: His stewardship of the debt limit fight is going to be a very large test of his leadership. Remember that during the fight to make him speaker in the first place, and the rules were changed so that any one member of Congress can initiate a process that could result in him being removed as the speaker. And so this is looming over him this whole time as he tries to negotiate these competing demands of the hard line conservatives who want these big spending cuts, you know, the moderates who don't know so they want those kinds of cuts, and the institutionalist in the Republican Party to who do want a definite raise.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Let's turn to the Senate now and now, public calls for Senator Dianne Feinstein to resign. We heard from Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna and Dean Phillips. She is recovering from shingles for two months now, 89 years old, no timeline on when she could return. While she's out, the president's judicial nominees, they are held up.</p><p>She's now asked to be temporarily replaced on Senate judiciary that needs a Republican support.</p><p>Are there more calls for her potentially to resign? And is this replacement going anywhere. If you need Republican support, they know they're getting someone else on that committee would mean that they would get some of those Biden nominees through.</p><p>WU: At least inside the building. Most of the calls for her to go stopped after the end of last week, especially after former Speaker Nancy Pelosi came out and said that she opposed it. So it looks like for now, publicly anyway, it's only limited to those two congressmen you mentioned Dean Phillips and Ro Khanna.</p><p>At the same time now, you know, the Democrats I talked to last week were very, very concerned whether she would even return to the Senate at all because of this illness, in part because her office had been relatively mum on her condition and one of her top aides recently departed her office. And so, the question for Democrats now is going to be how exactly they move on with so many questions about the senator's future in the chamber, even though you know she still has some time left in her term.</p><p>So to your question about how exactly we she would be replaced on the Judiciary Committee, that's also going to be a tall order for the Senate, since that's something that's going to take Republican support in order to do and Republicans are signaling they might try to come up that process somehow, if he did just as a protest vote.</p><p>BLACKWELL: All right. Last one here, former President Trump, his campaign in the joint fundraising committee, $18.8 million in donations jointly, they reported. According to his campaign, these are the interesting numbers here, for the entire first quarter, January 1st to the end of March. Trump received about 542,000 donations average of $34. In the two weeks since the indictment, the filing of those charges 312,000 or so donations average $49.</p><p>Now there are other investigations, potentially other shoes to drop. But what do these numbers mean to Republicans who are noncommittal on pro or anti-Trump for the nomination in 2024? Is this enough yet to say, well, maybe he's stronger than we think, and we should get back on the bandwagon?</p><p>WU: I think it goes to show that regardless of his legal troubles, the president -- the former president's standing within the Republican Party has really not been diminished. I mean, you know, it shows how he's pulling out most of his old playbook, playing the victim card using this, you know, get this aggressive campaign against his political enemies.</p><p>And it also shows how much of the, you know, small dollar fundraising force this could be. I mean, my phone has been deluge with emails from the Trump campaign, you know, railing against the investigations and asking for contributions. And so for now, anyway, and this has been a fairly potent line of attack for the former president, and it's not really something that his rivals have stepped up to attack him on either.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Nicholas Wu with \"Politico\", thanks so much.</p><p>For the latest from the political landscape, be sure to tune in to \"STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER AND DANA BASH\" this morning. Joining them today are Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, that's coming up next hour, right here on CNN.</p><p>WALKER: The African Union's Peace and Security Council says it will hold an emergency meeting later today to address the ongoing violence in Sudan as the country's army and paramilitary groups fight for control.</p><p>[08:10:02]</p><p>The push for diplomacy comes as the death toll in the conflict rises to 56 people dead, hundreds more injured. The majority of fighting is happening in the capital of Khartoum. But eyewitnesses tell CNN there have been escalating clashes further east in Sudan's main ports city along the Red Sea.</p><p>CNN's Larry Madowo has been following this story for us.</p><p>Larry, I know it's been a very fluid situation. What's the latest?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amara, the latest is that we're still hearing reports of fighting in parts of Sudan, even parts of Khartoum and the situation does not appear to be deescalating, even though every single international voice that's talked about this has asked the two parties to go back to the negotiating table to protect Sudanese civilians and to give peace a chance.</p><p>The African Union's Peace and Security Council is currently meeting. It's an emergency station. It's an emergency session to try and figure out a way out of this crisis. The regional body, the intergovernmental authority on development, has also convened. The emergency summit that will happen soon, and so far, all the leaders around the region here trying to talk to General Burhan, who leads the country, and his number two, General Hemitte, to abandon this violent streak that they have at least of the country this past two days and go back to the negotiating table.</p><p>Right now, the two countries that are immediate neighbors of Sudan, Egypt to the North and South Sudan to the south are both offering to immediate yesterday. The president of Kenya, William Ruto, also offered immediate.</p><p>Why is all this happening? Here is the background.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MADOWO (voice-over): Sudan's hopes for democracy once again shattered by the sounds of gunfire in Khartoum. Civilians have been told to take cover, while two of the country's main military factions, the army and a powerful paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, fight for supremacy.</p><p>Fighter jets launched by the army, led by General Abdel Fattah al- Burhan, fly low over the Sudanese capital with fighting reported in key sites like the presidential palace and Khartoum International Airport.</p><p>This video shows the chaos inside the terminal, with some people fearing for their lives as battles flared outside.</p><p>And the gunshots in some parts of cartoons so loud, they could be heard during a live television broadcast. Clashes also erupting in other parts of the country, with RSF fighters in the northern city of Meroe claiming to control a military airbase there. It's unclear which side started the fighting.</p><p>General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemitte, heads the RSF, which analysts say is 100,000 strong and grew out of the country's bloody conflict in Darfur. Hemitte says the army instigated the battle, calling al-Burhan a criminal.</p><p>The army accused the RSF of traitorous plotting and says there will be no dialogue until the group is dissolved. Tensions between the two factions have been festering since negotiations restarted to return to Sudan's civilian rule.</p><p>Part of the deal requires the RSF to merge with the army, but there were strong disagreements over how long that should take and who would ultimately have more power.</p><p>Both al-Burhan and Hemitte have worked together in the past when their interests aligned. The army and the RSF taking part in the coup four years ago to overthrow a longtime Sudanese leader, Omar al Bashir. And both were involved in another coup two years later, when the military seized control over transitional power sharing government, which is meant to lead to civilian rule.</p><p>The country's former prime minister, now appealing for both sides to stop the fighting.</p><p>ABDALLA HAMDOK, FORMER SUDANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The exchange of fire must stop immediately, and the voice of reason must rule. Everyone will lose and there is no victory when it is atop the bodies of our people.</p><p>MADOWO: There have been widespread calls for calm by the United Nations, the African Union and the United States. But it's the infighting once again in Sudan that is threatening its chances of a democratic future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MADOWO (on camera): The U.S. is a key diplomatic player in that transition back to civilian rule in Sudan and new statement from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the only way forward is to return to negotiations that support the Sudanese people's democratic aspirations. We continue to remain in close touch with our embassy in cartoon and we have full accountability of our personnel. We also have been communicating with American citizens who may be in the region about safety measures and other precautions.</p><p>But there is still no chance that these two men will come back to the negotiating table, guys.</p><p>WALKER: All right. Well, thanks for staying on top of this, Larry Madowo.</p><p>Still ahead, New Mexico police shot and killed a man after they went to the wrong house while responding to a domestic violence call. The bodycam video showing how all of this unfolded.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Plus, hundreds of inmates in Atlanta are being moved to separate jails after an outbreak of bedbugs and infectious illnesses.</p><p>[08:15:01]</p><p>What's being done to address the problem, that's coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALKER: Police in New Mexico have released body camera footage showing officers shooting a dead man after responding to a -- shooting a man dead, I should say, after responding to the wrong address.</p><p>BLACKWELL: The police chief is calling it a mistake and unbelievably tragic.</p><p>Here's CNN's Camila Bernal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Amara and Victor, this new video shows just how quickly everything happens. This incident started on April 6th at around 11:30 p.m. when three of the Farmington police officers respond to a domestic violence call. Once they get to the wrong house, they knock on the door. No one appears to be answering the door. At some point, they begin to back away from the house.</p><p>And moments later, you see Robert Dotson opening the door, and he does have a handgun. Now in one of these videos released by police, you can hear one of these officers saying that he heard a gun that was racked.</p><p>[08:20:04]</p><p>So that appears to be the explanation from that police officer.</p><p>Now the police chief, also saying that you do have to slow down the video to see exactly what happens. He says this was all a mistake. But here is how he describes that moment when Dotson opens the door.</p><p>CHIEF STEVE HEBBE, FARMINGTON, NEW MEXICO POLICE: When you show the slowdown version, you see him opening the door with his left hand, in his right hand is the gun. And as he pushes the door open, and then he comes together and both hands appeared to grip the weapon and pointed at one of the officers.</p><p>BERNAL: And Dotson's wife also opens fire at police officers. It is also very disturbing to hear the 911 call because it is their teenage daughter, who is talking to dispatch and saying that she doesn't know what's going on with her dad, and she doesn't know if her mom is also injured. She is at times crying, just really scared of what's going on at her own home.</p><p>Again, police saying this was all a mistake. This is now an investigation in the hands of the New Mexico state police and we'll have to wait to see what they say. But as of now, Farmington police just saying this was a mistake -- Amara, Victor.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLACKWELL: Camilla Bernal, thank you for the report.</p><p>In Georgia, more than 600 inmates will be transferred out of the Fulton County jail as the facility deals with an outbreak of bedbugs, vermin and overcrowding.</p><p>WALKER: According to the lawyer of one inmate's family, these are the conditions he was living in at that facility before he died there. They believe, unsanitary conditions and complications from insect bites contributed to his death. And they're calling for a criminal investigation.</p><p>CNN's Isabel Rosales has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And we did over the past week hear a little bit more from the family of LaShawn Thompson and from their family attorney, Michael Harper, who says that Thompson was in jail in custody for just three months before his death, held there in custody on misdemeanor assault charges.</p><p>They are blaming -- the family's blaming unsanitary conditions at the jail and also complications from insect bites for Thompson's death.</p><p>Now, they are demanding three things at large, and those things are for a criminal investigation to be place and done into Thompson's death, also for the current jail, Fulton County jail, Atlanta is in Fulton County, for that jail to be closed and for a new one to be built in its place.</p><p>Hear what the family had to say.</p><p>MICHAEL HARPER, ATTORNEY FOR THE FAMILY OF LASHAWN THOMPSON: It's an inexcusable death. It is an outrage, and we call them all the citizens of Fulton County to demand better and to demand a new jail.</p><p>BRAD MCCRAE, THOMPSON'S BROTHER: It was heartbreaking because nobody should be seen like that. Nobody should see that. But the first thing that entered my mind was Emmett Till, I thought about Emmett Till. Comparing those photos, it was heartbreaking.</p><p>ROSALES: We did reach out to the Fulton County sheriff's office and received a statement from them where they mentioned that they cannot speak because of the law about Thompson's health or what decisions he made regarding his right to accept or refuse medical care. But they did acknowledge the, quote, dilapidated and rapidly eroding conditions at the jail, saying in part in the statement: Without making any explicit statements about Mr. Thompson's health, it is fair to say that this is one of many cases that illustrate the desperate need for expanded and better mental health services.</p><p>That is precisely why Sheriff Patrick Labat continues to call for building a new Fulton County jail and criminal justice complex.</p><p>Now it is also important to note that we did review documents from the Fulton County medical examiner's office that listed Thompson's cause and manner of death as undetermined.</p><p>Isabel Rosales, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALKER: All right. Still ahead, we will take a deeper look at the rising tensions between China and Taiwan.</p><p>The friction, prompting people in Taiwan to prepare for the worst case scenario. Will Ripley joining me now -- next from Taipei to discuss.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:28:00]</p><p>WALKER: Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for an increase in combat training while visiting military forces. The announcement follows China's third day of drills and a show of force around Taiwan's coast. And for the first time, those exercises included the Chinese navy simulating strikes by aircraft carrier based warplanes.</p><p>In response, Taiwan's foreign minister told CNN China is ready to launch a war against Taiwan.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley joining us now, who knows the region very well.</p><p>You've been stationed in the Asia Pacific for about a decade now. And if you look at all the recent developments will in the Pacific in the South China Sea, the military war drills led by the us and the separately by China, of course, the announcement before parliament recently by Xi Jinping that he is preparing the country for war. And the U.S. Air Force general several months ago predicting war with China by 2025.</p><p>From all your reporting in the region, and also as you've been there in Taipei, do you sense it's really not a matter of if, but when?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, the series of events that are leading us up to this moment are really troubling, Amara. I don't say that war is inevitable. War can always be deterred if the United States and Taiwan and Western democracies convinced China that it was far too costly, far too risky to wage war on Taiwan. But, frankly, those leaked intel documents reported by \"The Washington Post\" is signaling the Taiwan might be more vulnerable than it projects are not a positive sign for Xi Jinping, who is emboldened, frankly, because he has more power than any Chinese leaders since Mao and he has the most powerful military that China arguably has ever commanded in modern history, the biggest military build up to the world has seen in 100 years, Amara.</p><p>[08:29:40]</p><p>WALKER: And I know you've done a lot of reports for the past few years on China's provocations in the South China Sea and the subsequent growing opposition over China's aggressiveness in Hong Kong. I know you were stationed there as well and Taiwan.</p><p>But there seems to be more urgency now over China's ambitions to reunite self-ruled Taiwan with the mainland.</p><p>So let's talk about the timing. And why now? I mean, do you think Trump's presidency with his isolationist policies, this new world order that China is trying to lead and, of course, the war in Ukraine. Is that all factoring into this?</p><p>RIPLEY: Well, certainly there are two ideologies that are gearing up really for this -- for this clash, this global clash if you will.</p><p>You have the authoritarian ideology of China and Russia. And then you have democracies led by the United States. And Xi Jinping, along with his ally Vladimir Putin, believe that now is the time for the world order to change. And part of changing that world order from China's view is to is to revive this -- this -- this -- this great Chinese revival, which would include, according to every communist leader for the last 70 plus years retaking this island of Taiwan because at the end of China's civil war, the losing side came here and after a period of decades they formed this young and vibrant democracy, which is now closely allied with the United States.</p><p>That's a big problem for China, for their communist rulers, for their legitimacy because they believe that in order to -- for China to truly fulfill its potential, they need to retake control of Taiwan, which is strategically located in the middle of the first island chain and just a very short distance from Japan and of course, the United States beyond that.</p><p>So Taiwan is crucial in the communist party's plan and no leader has ever had more determination to do this than Xi Jinping. And he's made it very clear he wants to do it while he's in power.</p><p>So whether it were to happen now, five years from now, 10 years from now, Xi Jinping has basically told us what he wants to do. He just hasn't indicated exactly when he wants to do it.</p><p>WALKER: And if we can show some video of this you did a really remarkable report. You got an exclusive look inside one of the U.S. Navy's nuclear powered submarines, the USS Mississippi and America's readiness for a potential invasion. Just curious what stood out to you in that report and just being on that submarine?</p><p>RIPLEY: Well, there are Americans right now, you know, operating for months at a time, you know, deep underneath the ocean. And these nuclear submarines, the United States naval fleet, they are perhaps the biggest deterrent right now that would prevent China from making a move on Taiwan because no other country has the underwater power of the United States.</p><p>These submarines are virtually impossible to detect. Some of them carry nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, others carry missiles that could take out ships, targets on land and essentially can strike without being able to be detected.</p><p>And so this would be a huge problem for China Even though they have the world's largest naval fleet. They don't come anywhere close to the U.S. when it comes to submarines and when it comes to the kind of technology that the U.S. has under the ocean.</p><p>And this, particularly with the new office partnership that will put U.S. submarines in regular rotation in Australia, you know, bringing them into this part of the world with more frequency is certainly a major problem for Xi Jinping and his plans to take Taiwan because he knows that if the United States were to intervene and to start using its submarine fleet, along with its aircraft carrier strike groups, it could devastate a huge part of China's naval fleet.</p><p>Unfortunately for the United States, U.S. involvement would also likely mean according to war games simulations, huge casualties on the U.S. side as well. You're talking about the potential for aircraft carriers to be sunk, and it would be the kind of catastrophic war in which there really would be no winners, despite whatever the outcome would be, which is why I would say again, it's crucial for the United States to work together with other democracies.</p><p>And a lot of a lot of diplomats, a lot of experts have told me this to send a signal to China that taking Taiwan would be far more dangerous and costly than Xi Jinping should be willing to risk.</p><p>But there are many people and we're not convinced that that message is being relayed strongly enough, at least not right now.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Will Ripley really appreciate this in depth look at the tensions there. Thank you so much.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Still ahead, another problem for the Boeing 737 max. The company acknowledges a manufacturing issue but there is no need to be worried about your safety.</p><p>[08:34:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLACKWELL: Here's a look at some of the other stories we're following.</p><p>The U.S. Coast Guard and Mexican navy crews are looking for three missing American sailors. They were last heard from on April 4th near Mazatlan, Mexico. Now they were headed to San Diego on a 44-foot boat. They were supposed to make a stop in Cabo San Lucas on April 6th, but they never made it.</p><p>The family members said that the three have decades of experience sailing between them. But the commander in charge of the search said that they started this voyage in rough weather.</p><p>WALKER: This morning a forest fire is under control in central Maine after being sparked by yet another train derailment. Three engines and six railcars went off the tracks near the small village of Rockwood. The cars that derailed were carrying lumber and electrical wiring. Officials say there was never a threat to public safety.</p><p>And there are more headaches for Boeing. The company says it found an issue with parts made by one of its suppliers for its 737 Max airplane.</p><p>BLACKWELL: The news has unnerved some investors. Shares are down more than 5 percent but the company says its planes are still safe to fly.</p><p>Our Pete Muntean has the latest on the story. Pete give us some details.</p><p>PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: Victor, Amara -- this is another bad look for Boeing as it struggles to deal with quality control and to rebuild the reputation of the 737 Max. Those failures at Boeing and with the systems inside each plane led to those two crashes abroad in 2018 and 2019, 350 people killed.</p><p>[08:39:51]</p><p>MUNTEAN: This new issue is different though. Boeing is coming clean about a defect in the manufacturing of the jet itself. The issue, Boeing says, is with a fitting in the rear part of the fuselage of some Maxes. It's manufactured by a third party.</p><p>Boeing has not said exactly how many Maxes are defective, though there are about a thousand flying worldwide and more than 300 in the U.S. In a statement, Boeing says this is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in service fleet can continue operating safely.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, which came down hard on Boeing after investigations into those two crashes, says it has validated what Boeing says is true and is monitoring next steps.</p><p>The contractor responsible for building these parts is a company called Spirit AeroSystems. It said on Friday it was still working on an inspection and repair for affected airplanes.</p><p>But for now, this is not impacting travelers simply airlines waiting on new airplanes, and they are waiting for a fix.</p><p>Victor, Amara.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Pete, thank you very much. Finding purpose from trauma. Coming up, hear the incredible story of one Boston Marathon bombing survivor and how he is now offering a network of support to victims of terrorism and hate crimes around the world.</p><p>[08:41:07]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALKER: Tomorrow is the Boston Marathon, and this year marks 10 years since two bombs went off near the finish line, killing three people, injuring hundreds more.</p><p>Yesterday the city of Boston came together to remember the victims and honor the survivors and to celebrate the resiliency and strength demonstrated in response to the tragedy.</p><p>BLACKWELL: 10 years ago, Dave Fortier was nearing the finish line when the first bomb went off. He walked away with shrapnel wounds in his right foot and hearing loss.</p><p>He joins us now. Dave, thank you for being with us. I am -- I'm reluctant to ask people to take us back to the day, which sometimes is the worst day of their -- of their lives.</p><p>But how does that day inform your life? How do you -- what's the context in which you see that day 10 years ago?</p><p>DAVE FORTIER, SURVIVOR OF BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING: Actually the -- it's changed for me dramatically. It's a 1e80 from where I was. I worked in wireless telecommunications. And I'm doing something very different today.</p><p>But I was there on a beautiful day. It was a great day to go out for a run. And at the very end when everything happened I don't remember several seconds of it. I don't actually remember being hit by the shrapnel. I just remember the sound and the heat and being pushed sideways.</p><p>I didn't even know that I had finished the marathon. You know, I don't remember crossing the finish line.</p><p>WALKER: Your resiliency is remarkable and the way that you've channeled the trauma and the pain to help others is more than notable as well. I do want to ask you though about tomorrow. And I mean I'm so impressed to hear that this is going to be your 11th Boston Marathon.</p><p>Is there -- what goes through your mind? Because you -- that means you've run a marathon almost every year since that bombing occurred. What is it like for you to run the marathon year after year?</p><p>FORTIER: It's -- it really is incredible. I was I was going to be one and done when finishing that day. I was running for a dear friend that was dealing with cancer at the time.</p><p>And after everything that happened after the bombing several of us were in rehab and some people were still in hospitals.</p><p>And many of us were visited by veterans of an organization called the Simplifying America's Fund. And these veterans came to Boston on their own to visit with us in a peer to peer way. That allowed us to connect with others that have been through something similar.</p><p>And coming from a process background seeing that happen and seeing the relationships that formed after those visits -- during those visits was really amazing, and it led to us forming a foundation several years later in 2018 that works with survivors here in this country, survivors in other countries, people that have been impacted in terrorist extremists and mass casualty events globally.</p><p>And it's that peer to peer relationship and that healing process that can be such a difference for many people. And that's what we do now.</p><p>BLACKWELL: This is the One World Strong Foundation you're speaking about and tell us more about those relationships. Are these just, you know, here's a number to call for someone who has lived through what you're living through now? What do you do?</p><p>FORTIER: Well there is -- there are ways to reach us. There's contact @OneWorldStrong.org. That's one way to reach us. Our phone numbers are easy to find. But we also reach out after events happen, just as an example and the relationships that we have here in Boston with first responders that helped all of us that day.</p><p>I'll give you the example of Pittsburgh a few years ago. There was a synagogue shooting and I'm sure you're all familiar with it. I'm sure you've covered it.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>FORTIER: And we reached out to Billy Evans here in Boston, former police commissioner and we worked with Billy to connect us with his counterpart in Pittsburgh. We don't just show up somewhere. We work with the community to be a part of that community after something happens.</p><p>And it's those relationships that form both with first responders, with families that have lost loved ones, with survivors in an event.</p><p>[08:49:52]</p><p>FORTIER: It really does build from the community, and I think that's the big thing about Boston is Boston had that community. The city really came together, to work together and 10 years later, if you saw some of the events from yesterday, everybody is still very much together.</p><p>WALKER: It's beautiful how you bring so many people around the world together. And really, is these human connections that really help -- seem to help the healing process.</p><p>Dave Fortier, thank you for what you do. And thanks for joining us.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Good luck tomorrow.</p><p>WALKER: Oh yes.</p><p>FORTIER: Thank you very much.</p><p>WALKER: Good luck.</p><p>FORTIER: Thank you. Take care guys.</p><p>WALKER: Take care, yourself.</p><p>For more information on how you can help survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing, Give Back, go to CNN.com/Impact.</p><p>Back with us.</p><p>[08:50:30]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLACKWELL: On tonight's episode of \"EVA LONGORIA: SEARCHING FOR MEXICO\", Eva is in Nuevo Leon in northeast Mexico experiencing the food of her childhood.</p><p>We say experiencing food, she's eating right?</p><p>WALKER: It's an experience.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Ok.</p><p>WALKER: It's a life experience.</p><p>BLACKWELL: Here's a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EVA LONGORIA, ACTRESS/ACTIVIST: Arturo is preparing his famous charro beans.</p><p>It smells so good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not traditional frijoles charros because my dad has a little secret.</p><p>LONGORIA: He has a secret.</p><p>I grew up with this.

The Warriors trying to win back to back to back titles in their fifth and nine years.</p><p>WALKER: Yes. Coy Wire joining us now.</p><p>Coy, things did not get off to a great start for those defending champions.</p><p>COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I was experiencing some beverages watching these games yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WIRE: The Golden State they're the defending champs. Look this season, they lost 30 of their 41 away games and here they were in this battle of northern California against Sacramento just an hour and 40 minute drive against the Kings, and they still couldn't get right in the playoffs.</p><p>The Kings fans, they came out in droves to the arena there in Sacramento, getting their first playoff appearances 16 years that was the longest postseason drought in NBA history.</p><p>Their star De'Aaron Fox outdueling Steph Curry, and this one is three right there put Sacramento ahead with about three minutes to go. 29 of his 38 points came in the second half.</p><p>Curry still finished with 30 points. Here's that step back three there to give Golden State within two. The Warriors though took 50 3-point shots. They only made 16.</p><p>And Andrew Wiggins there missed that wide open one with seconds to go. It would have tied it. Fox's college teammate Malik Monk became the second player ever to drop 30 plus points in a playoff debut. He had 32 of them. Kings win 126 - 123.</p><p>Now Cleveland they hadn't made the playoffs without Lebron there in a quarter century, but Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs they are back. A game high of 38, an all out hustle and defense for Mitchell diving on the floor to make plays like this in the final minutes, kept his team in it.</p><p>They had the lead with about two minutes to go. But New York's Jalen Brunson was cooking in Cleveland in the second half, scoring 21 of his 27 points. Brunson and the Knicks hold off the late charge by the Cavs stealing an away game win in game 1, 101-97.</p><p>The Celtics and 76ers, they each cruise to wins in their playoff openers, and we have four more games today, starting with Lebron and the Lakers, followed by a triple header on our sister network, TNT.</p><p>Now it was a perfect 10 ending at the national gymnastics championships. Florida's Trinity Thomas flawless. Look at this sticking a 1.5 Yurchenko on the final vault of her career. It's her 28th perfect 10, tying the all time career record. She's one of the greatest college gymnasts of all time.</p><p>We also witnessed one of the greatest teams of all time. Oklahoma and sophomore star Danae Fletcher (ph) less than two years after a wrist surgery saved her career, she stomped it out there on the floor to secure a second straight national title for the Sooners.</p><p>They've now won six of their last nine national championships, and it's more than just about what we see at these moments. It's like Danae Fletcher, like her mother, you know, they grew up in Philly, she was having to work multiple jobs to help get her daughter the training that she needed. You know, 7-9 years old driving her two hours every day to practice then would go back and work. Then would go pick her daughter up. That's love, you know.</p><p>[08:59:53]</p><p>WIRE: So it's a -- it's a congratulations to the whole family and stories like that. That makes it --</p><p>BLACKWELL: It all pays off. It all pays off.</p><p>WIRE: Yes. Big moment.</p><p>BLACKWELL: All right. Coy, thank you.</p><p>WIRE: You got it.

If the gas crisis is a candle flame and lumber prices are a campfire, then growing inflation is a forest fire that has ignited and may eventually burn through our entire economy,  Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) tweeted earlier this month. Officials within the Biden Administration and the central bank have repeatedly emphasized that a short-term spike in prices is to be expected as the economy recovers and will fade over time.\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0What To Watch For</emphasis></h><p>The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and investors will be watching closely for any clues that the central bank plans to tighten policy and begin withdrawing some of its support for the economy. Many experts expect the Fed to continue to hold the line on interest rates, which have been at near-zero levels since the onset of the pandemic.  Even though inflation metrics are high, the pressure is starting to come off and that leaves investors to say,  Gee, the Fed is right, the Fed knows what it s doing, and we don t have to worry about the Fed hiking rates too quickly or an inflation problem in this economy,   Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>told Bloomberg</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contra</emphasis></h><p>It s not all smooth sailing ahead.  Transitory inflation is occurring in parts of the market, particularly commodities, as prices for corn, copper and lumber are well off their highs, but housing inflation is a thornier issue for the Federal Reserve,  says Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist of Dallas-based Quill Intelligence. That s because the housing sector accounts for a much larger slice of the economy than commodities. DiMartino Booth says rental prices are likely to be the  next inflationary victim  and expects them to surge as large cities reopen.\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Critic</emphasis></h><p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>said Monday</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>that if the Fed does not act soon to address signs of rising inflation (consumer prices rose 5% in May),  It s just a green light to bet heavily on every inflation trade.

And the latest turn in a shocking rejection of the rule of law in Texas with the governor wants to pardon the convicted murderer at the behest of cable news host.</p><p>When ALL IN starts right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES (on camera): Good evening from New York. I`m Chris Hayes. The more details that emerge about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas` relationship with billionaire conservative activist Harlan Crow, the more this looks like the biggest scandal the court has seen in generations. It may even be the biggest since 1969 when Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas was forced to resign after his financial dealings with a wealthy donor came to light. So, let`s just run through what we know about Clarence Thomas and his friend Harlan Crow so far because just the details themselves are damning.</p><p>So, last week, ProPublica incredible reporting broke the story about the lavish gifts Thomas has received from his billionaire buddy. For 20 years, Thomas has been joining Crow on vacations worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. He has flown on Crow`s private plane, cruised around the globe on his 162-foot super yacht, and made annual trips to his private resort in the Adirondack Mountains.</p><p>Crow even commissioned this just breathtakingly beautiful painting memorializing their time at the resort smoking cigars alongside conservative lawyers. There`s Leonard Leo right there, the guy that runs the Federal Society, and that`s Crow on the far right seated next to Thomas. Now, crucially, and this is really, really key, Thomas never reported any of this at all on his financial disclosure forms. That appears to be a clear violation of a law passed after the Watergate scandal that requires justices to disclose most gifts.</p><p>Now, in the wake of that bombshell ProPublica report Justice Thomas released a damningly weak and weasley statement claiming that early in his tenure on the court, \"he was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends who did not have business before the court was not reportable.</p><p>Now, I think that excuse really doesn`t pass muster. First of all, as the LA Times reported nearly two decades ago, Thomas used to disclose gifts from Harlan Crow. For example, on his 2001 disclosure, he reported that Crow gave him a 19,000 Bible that once belonged to Frederick Douglass. That is a very cool gift by the way. But after that story ran, mysteriously, Thomas stopped disclosing gifts from Crow. So, it sure seems like maybe he didn`t want people to know that he was receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts from a billionaire conservative activist.</p><p>The other key point, and I truly, truly cannot emphasize this enough is that Clarence Thomas` whole job is to use his judgment to make judgment calls while judging. He sits on the highest court in the land where he judges others and he makes rulings on what the best thing to do is when the text or the law is unclear, ambiguous, or even absent. It is an unbelievable confession of complete judicial bankruptcy to say well, you know, I ask a few people, I didn`t think I need to let anyone know I was island hopping with a billionaire.</p><p>Now, we have seen calls from Democratic lawmakers and ethics groups for Clarence Thomas to be investigated or even to resign, or in some cases to be impeached. And you know, even if those set of revelations about Harlan Crow`s lavish generosity towards the justice unreported, if that was the end of it, if it stopped there, that would be bad enough. But now, there`s this new development in the story, and it makes it all even worse.</p><p>ProPublica has discovered that Harlan Crow purchased property from Clarence Thomas and his family and Thomas never disclosed that transaction. In 2014, Crow purchased three properties in Savannah, Georgia, a two-bedroom home and two vacant lots. The total purchase price was over $133,000. The sellers were Justice Clarence Thomas, his elderly mother, and the family of his late brother. Now, the Justice signed the paperwork himself. That is his signature on the warranty deed. So, this was not done through some proxy. That`s Clarence Thomas`s signing the deed.</p><p>[20:05:34]</p><p>After the sale, Crow hired a renowned architecture firm to carry out tens of thousands of dollars` worth of improvements on that single-story home. They added a carport, a new fence, and gates, repaired the roof. Justice Thomas` mother Leola Williams is now 94 years old and she`s still living in that home today which is, to her great benefit, and I`m glad for her, a much-improved house. Harlan Crow claims that he purchased the house where Thomas lived as a child and said he could \"one day create a public museum telling the story of our nation`s second Black Supreme Court Justice.\"</p><p>Now, he didn`t explain why he also purchased the two vacant lots down the street but revealed they were later sold to a vetted builder who is committed to improving the quality of the neighborhood and preserving its historical integrity which, OK, I mean, if you want to do that with your money. Again, all this sounds like nice enough if you`re on the receiving end of it, and maybe it`s motivated entirely notably by Harlan Crow. I don`t know. I can`t read his mind. But let`s just walk through all the ways that this is completely ethically unacceptable.</p><p>First of all, it`s not clear if Harlan Crow paid fair market value for these properties. In his financial disclosures as late as 2009, Clarence Thomas valued his one-third stake in the properties at just $15,000, which would put the total value of those properties times three at $45,000. $45,000 is quite a bit less than the $133,000 that Crow paid five years later. Maybe that real estate in Savannah went up a ton during those five years. I don`t know. But obviously, overpaying for a piece of property is a notorious tried and true way of disguising a bribe or a corrupt gift.</p><p>Now, I`m not saying that`s what happened here. But the point is the possibility of using a real estate transaction for that kind of disguise bribe is precisely the reason that you must report real estate sales on financial disclosures.</p><p>Now, another question. We don`t know -- I mean I suspect she is but I don`t know if Clarence Thomas` mother is paying rent. And God, you don`t really want to drag this 94-year-old woman into this but Harlan Crow already kind of did that. But Harlan Crow is her landlord, so does she pay him rent every month? And if she is, let`s be clear about what exactly happened here, the billionaire patron of Justice Clarence Thomas purchased his elderly mother`s house which is a really important place I would imagine in the Thomas`s life, right? Taking over all the upkeep and the maintenance and the property taxes and the carrying costs and invested tens of thousands of dollars in making it nicer, improving it.</p><p>Now, again, that`s great for Clarence Thomas`s mom, but it is plainly and obviously an enormous gift to Clarence Thomas and his family, obviously. Everyone knows that. Justice Thomas knows that. He`s even indicated in public that his relationship with Harlan Crow is valuable. I want you to listen to this really, really telling moment from an interview with Torture Memo author John Yoo last year.</p><p>JOHN YOO, AUTHOR, TORTURE MEMO: I want to thank you for joining us this evening. And I think -- I`m sure you and all of us want to join uh Harlan - - thank Harlan Crow and his family for making this wonderful facilities. I know Harlan hates that. So, I knew we had --</p><p>THOMAS: No, he don`t. That`s why I wouldn`t say it.</p><p>YOO: I knew we had to do it.</p><p>THOMAS: I like to keep that friendship.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: I`m sure he would like to keep that friendship. And again, Harlan Crow is not just some disinterested friend, though by all accounts, the two men are genuine friends, right? They`re buddies. Fine, yes, absolutely, stipulated. But this is a man who has oriented much of his public life and his fortune around the project of remaking the country along his conservative ideology.</p><p>I mean, just imagine an imaginary version of this on the other side. Let`s say we found out this week that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor spent weeks island hopping on liberal billionaire George Soros`s yacht. Imagine Sonia Sotomayor spent every summer hanging out at a property owned by Soros or if Soros bought a house owned by Sotomayor`s elderly relative and fix it up, if George Soros was Sotomayor`s mom`s landlord. Would anyone?</p><p>I mean, first of all, the right would lose its mind. But would anyone even left, right, whatever, suggests oh that`s fine, nothing to see here. They didn`t report it. Of course not. The situation is unacceptable on its face. Now, we`re left with two big questions. What if any consequences will Clarence Thomas face? And do we actually know the whole story here about his relationship with Harlan Crow or could there be even more shoes to drop?</p><p>[20:10:22]</p><p>Jesse Eisinger is a senior editor ProPublica which broke both of these stories about Clarence Thomas. Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Now, that group just followed a civil and criminal complaint against Thomas, calling on the Department of Justice and the Supreme Court to investigate the justice.</p><p>Jesse, let me just start with you on what to me is a really notable point here which is that after this story -- the first story being published, Thomas issues a statement. It`s rare that he does that, but he does, as is Harlan Crow. After the second story is published, Harlan Crow issues a statement saying this was all my plan to build this museum which again, maybe that`s true. I don`t know.</p><p>Thomas has said nothing so far. Am I right about that or have I missed some sort of response?</p><p>JESSE EISINGER, SENIOR EDITOR, PROPUBLICA: No, that`s uh absolutely right. Thanks for having me on again. I`m happy to be here. The -- it`s really remarkable that Thomas first, that he responded to the story. Now, he didn`t respond to the first story when we reached out for comment. And let me be clear that when we reach out for comment, we run everything by the subject of the story an extensive list of questions that my reporters produced because we`re in no surprises journalism outfit. So, everything that we`re going to write about a subject, we try to seek comments extensive and give them fair and adequate time to respond to.</p><p>No response to the first story but then he was pressured by the response to that story to issue the statement that you referred to. In the second time, we did the exact same thing. We went to them we gave them adequate notice. We went to Crow. Crow asked for a little bit more time. We gave them more time to go through the records. Then Crow responded and it was absolute silence from Thomas himself, which is really stunning that he doesn`t feel like he owes the public any response at all to this.</p><p>HAYES: Noah, let`s say that all of this at the level of the gifts and the financial transactions is kosher and not corrupting. I`m a little skeptical that being the case, but let`s say. On the matter of the law and disclosure, what does the law say about whether you have to tell people that your billionaire buddy has bought your mom`s house?</p><p>NOAH BOOKBINDER, PRESIDENT, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND ETHICS IN WASHINGTON: The law is absolutely clear on this. There is a -- these financial disclosure forms. They`re not actually that long and complicated. I was a federal employee for a lot of years. I filled out a lot of them. And you know, there is a place where you need to list if you have engaged in real estate transactions. And you don`t have to report about uh buying and selling your own house because it`s sort of assumed that everybody`s going to going to do that.</p><p>But what`s interesting is Clarence Thomas declared these properties repeatedly on his financial disclosures as rental properties that he was making income for. So, he knew these were rental properties -- rental properties. It`s crystal clear that you got to -- that you got to declare, you know, ownership of properties that are not your house. If you sell that, you get money in, you have to declare that. Those properties kind of magically just disappear from his financial disclosures without any mention of this money he got from this person who lo and behold happens to be the same person who is paying for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of lavish vacations for him.</p><p>It is -- with the vacation, that`s we think pretty clear that he had an obligation to disclose there too. It`s quite clear. But there are sort of arguments you could kind of make around the margins. There are no arguments on the -- on the real estate transactions and it`s just impossible to comprehend.</p><p>HAYES: Jesse, are you -- again, this is a weird question but like, is his mother paying rent to Harlan Crow? It just seems like such a weird situation.</p><p>EISINGER: I agree. And we don`t know the answer to that. We asked both of them and they didn`t respond. We`re continuing to report, of course. And just to underscore what Noah said, there are two other things. One of the things is that you are required to say who you sold the property to and Thomas left it blank. The second thing is that there was a footnote in it that said that the properties are no longer producing rent for Thomas as the reason why it was not disclosed which is a really cute way of saying that you`ve actually sold them.</p><p>[20:15:07]</p><p>HAYES: Yes, you`ve actually sold them.</p><p>EISINGER: And it goes to a question that we don`t know the full answer to and the full contours to, but what was the intent here and how much he understood about the disclosure forms. He is a Supreme Court justice. You`d think that he would understand the rules and obligations and ethical responsibilities. But the question is, you know, intent here. Was there an obfuscatory attempt here? And that`s really suggestive of it.</p><p>HAYES: Noah, tell me what your -- what complaints your organization filed today and what they mean?</p><p>BOOKBINDER: So, we wrote today to Chief Justice Roberts of the Supreme Court and to Attorney General Merrick Garland of the Department of Justice asking both of them to investigate, to see if Clarence Thomas violated ethical rules and if he violated the law which can be violations of particularly the disclosure law can be civil, they can also be criminal.</p><p>One of the things about the Supreme Court is that essentially nobody oversees the Supreme Court but the justices themselves. Usually, when there are questions say about whether a justice needs to step aside from a case because they may have a conflict, it`s kind of up to that justice to evaluate their own case and we`re supposed to have enough faith in them to trust them to do the right thing about themselves.</p><p>Clearly, in Clarence Thomas`s case, you know, that`s not working. This is not the first ethics incident even in recent years with Clarence Thomas. And so, somebody needs to be looking at this. We -- you know, Chief Justice Roberts has been kind of looking the other way on very significant ethics issues in the Supreme Court and in the Judiciary as public opinion of the judiciary craters. And it`s time for him to get involved. And it may be if the court is not going to take care of itself, it may be time for the Justice Department to get involved also because there has to be some accountability. There should be a code of conduct in the court. There should be somebody who can look at them.</p><p>HAYES: Yes. At a minimum, I like to hear a statement from Clarence times explaining what`s going on just like that`ll be like first pass of this. Jesse Eisinger and Noah Bookbinder, thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, the Supreme Court`s moment intervention in the abortion pill ruling. And outrage in Florida where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law effectively banning abortions in that state.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:20:00]</p><p>HAYES: The Supreme Court today put a temporary hold on parts of that Texas abortion pill ruling that came from the Appellate Court at least until Wednesday. While the full court considers the Biden administration`s emergency request to stay the order altogether, which is to say to allow Mifepristone to be sold across the country. And at least for now until Wednesday, Mifepristone will remain available across the country to those who need it.</p><p>Bans on such medications are seriously unpopular. A Reuters-Ipsos poll found 73 percent of Democrats and 51 percent of Republicans oppose state- level restrictions on access to abortion pills. On top of that, 43 percent of Republicans said they were less likely to vote for a candidate who wants to limit abortion access.</p><p>Limiting abortion access, cutting it off completely, is politically toxic, which is one of the reasons why the leader of the Republican Party, a man who weirdly does have a decent nose for politics, is warning his base they are \"getting killed on abortion.\"</p><p>Rolling Stone reports on inside meetings Donald Trump held with right-wing religious figures, \"the ex-President has warned leaders in off the record conversations. Republicans risk losing big in Trump`s words unless they follow his lead. He has warned the leaders to shift their own messaging, telling them to emphasize exceptions to abortion bans and has stressed that in his 2024 plan saying it`s necessary to prevent Democrats from painting him as an extremist.\"</p><p>Now, Trump`s instincts on this are right. He`s onto something here. But the man who single-handedly destroyed Roe and paved the way for women to hemorrhage blood at home because doctors aren`t legally allowed to terminate non-viable fetuses probably isn`t going to work as the moderate messenger.</p><p>That said, this problem isn`t just a Trump problem, it encompasses the whole party. Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis headed back to his home state briefly yesterday amidst his nationwide book tour to sign a near-total ban on abortions in the State of Florida under the cover of darkness. This was the fanfare and media event that DeSantis created one year ago today when he signed Florida`s 15-week abortion ban. We would show you the governor signing the new bill and proudly showing off like he does there, smiling. But what a difference a year makes.</p><p>This new ban which begins at six weeks, functionally the very beginning of a recognized pregnancy was signed quietly just before 11:00 p.m. last night. Rather than giving a speech, the governor caught a flight back out of the state and back to his book tour and didn`t mention it at a speech at liberty the next day.</p><p>[20:25:23]</p><p>Michele Goodwin is a professor of law at University of California, Irvine. She`s author of Policing The Womb: Invisible Women In The Criminalization Of Motherhood. She`s written extensively on the right to a need for abortion care. And she joins me now.</p><p>Michele, I just want to start with a technical point about a six-week ban. And I`ve struggled with how to describe that if it`s distinct in any way from a \"total ban.\" But effectively, what does a six-week ban mean for pregnant folks and women in the State of Florida who need abortion care?</p><p>MICHELE GOODWIN, LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE: It means - - and thank you very much for inviting me on -- it means chaos and cruelty quite specifically. At six weeks of pregnancy, most people would know that they actually happen to be pregnant, which basically means the clock starts ticking right away. And Texas is already had a six weeks ban with the SB8 ruling that also law that also provided for people to bounty hunt those who aid and abet a person terminating a pregnancy.</p><p>We`ve seen the chaos there just last week or a couple weeks ago. We have five women in that state suing because their lives were placed at risk. And they`re also concerned about their doctors. Just as you mentioned in the state of Texas, and what we`ll end up seeing in Florida, is that the risks will be really high.</p><p>In Texas we have doctors that risk losing medical licenses to practice up to 99 years incarceration, and also $100,000 in fines and fees. In Florida which had been a bit of a mecca for people who were in abortion deserts, meaning in states where abortion has been totally banned, at least they could come to Florida. Now, that`s off the table.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, this is the map we should show. I mean, this really is seismic for the entire South and all the neighboring border states where Florida had the 15-week ban but a more permissive regime than what was in other places. That`s now gone throughout the entire South.</p><p>I want to ask you about something that I`m finding particularly despicable actually in the discourse here, which is very clear that Republican politicos realize that they`re getting killed on the exceptions thing. People hate it. You got to throw some exceptions in there. And so, in Florida, there are \"exceptions\" for incest and rape. But in order to make that substantively operable in any way, it`s essentially impossible. You have to show proof to get an exception to get an abortion.</p><p>GOODWIN: Absolutely.</p><p>HAYES: What does this mean these exceptions on the actual ground as someone who`s studied this?</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, you know, for the people that are pushing for them, they`re using -- they`re looking to use it as a means to gain votes because otherwise everyone understands the cruelty behind these kinds of legislation. But it is really difficult to actually on the ground utilize these exceptions.</p><p>So, let`s think about it this way. A 9-year-old girl who`s been serially raped or a 10-year-old such as after Dobbs with a girl who had to leave Ohio to get to Indiana. How is she going to make her way to the local police station to file the report? And when she files that report and possibly is taken away from her home, then where is she going to be placed? Sometimes children are placed in religiously affiliated foster homes. Will the people in that religiously affiliated foster home provide the care that this child needs when she wants to be able to terminate a pregnancy? How will a 10-year-old even know by six weeks that she is pregnant?</p><p>I mean all of these kinds of things can create inordinate obstacles and hurdles which makes it more illusory than real that people can actually use the exceptions.</p><p>HAYES: What is your read on the landscape right now in terms of how quickly this is moved and the map which now looks very fixed and whether we`re going to see that map expand or stay where it is?</p><p>GOODWIN: Chris, this is like a forest fire. This is like what we see in the state of California once the kindling gets started and you have to pull all hands on deck in order to try to put out the fire. It`s going fast and it`s rapid. And we are really beginning to see something that is like a map from slavery. And that`s not hyperbole. Understanding as well that the people who are most hurt by these laws happen to be Black and Brown too.</p><p>And we really have free states and we have non-free states. I mean, we literally have places where people`s bodily autonomy, their dignity will be respected and other states where that just simply doesn`t matter.</p><p>HAYES: HAYES: Michelle Goodwin who is an incredible scholar on this topic, thank you very much for your time. I really appreciate it.</p><p>GOODWIN: Thank you, Chris.</p><p>HAYES: Still ahead, new polling shows Americans like the MAGA Republican platform less and less. So, why are Republicans full speed ahead with one terrible plan after another? Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:30:00]</p><p>HAYES: We are 100 days into the new Congress and the polling is clear, the more that voters learn about the MAGA Republican House, the more they dislike it.</p><p>One poll conducted last week shows that voters disapprove of House Republicans virtually all top issues including abortion, were 56 percent, oppose their anti-abortion stance and only a little over a third approve.</p><p>[20:35:09]</p><p>That view is on full display during a couple of focus groups of swing voters in Pennsylvania, conducted by Axios and its partners. The 14 Pennsylvanians and the focus groups voted for Donald Trump in 2016. And switched to Joe Biden in 2020, half registered Republicans, the rest of mix of Democrats and independents.</p><p>Now, half of them identified as pro-life. They still oppose decision by a federal judge in Texas that would make the abortion pill mifepristone unavailable nationwide.</p><p>One pro-life Republican equated abortion to murder but still said she`s against outlawing the abortion pill. It`s between them and their God, said Donna B., I don`t get gleeful about somebody who can`t kill a baby.</p><p>Stuart Stevens is a senior adviser to Lincoln Project, author of the book, It Was All a Lie: How The Republican Party Became Donald Trump.</p><p>And I want to start on this abortion question as someone who worked in Republican politics for decades. And I have noticed Republican politicians now that the dog having caught the car, and actual bans, actual people, actually hemorrhaging blood while they wait for their pregnancy to terminate or to get so in such dire straits and you to go to the hospital.</p><p>Republicans love the term pro-life because it pulls well and it sounds good. But I think everyone`s discovering that that was a little bit detached from what people actually meant by that term, as displayed by that woman in the focus group who`s sort of a perfect example.</p><p>STUART STEVENS, SENIOR ADVISER, THE LINCOLN PROJECT: You know, I mean, first, any abortion ban is really an abortion ban just on poor people. People I grew up in Mississippi, a state now that has an abortion ban, and when it had an abortion ban, and I knew girls who got pregnant and had abortions, because their parents had the means to take them out of state. That same pattern is going to continue now.</p><p>What I find most interesting about this polling, Chris, is the intensity level. So, if you look at these polling numbers, about 65 percent don`t approve of the Dobb`s decision.</p><p>But the intensity here, which is really what you want to look at in politics, to very favorable and very unfavorable of women, 47 percent are very unfavorable to it. And only 21 percent are very favorable.</p><p>And that`s when you start getting down to who`s going to actually make their voting decision based on this. And I think that`s what`s really killing Republicans here, that the intensity of this issue is overwhelmingly on the other side.</p><p>HAYES: I want to ask your read on DeSantis in the last 24 hours, it`s fascinating to me. So, he in -- he signed a 15-week ban. In the gubernatorial election, he would not commit what he was going to do. About a six-week ban, even though everyone knew it was coming, didn`t want to talk about it, gets reelected, signs it at night. Talks at Liberty University, dozens -- at Liberty University doesn`t mention it.</p><p>The next day, the House, the GOP, the Republican GOP puts out a newsletter in Florida about like what they did the previous day, not on the newsletter. What does that say to you?</p><p>STEVENS: Yes, well, it`s pretty obvious.</p><p>Look, DeSantis is finding out to getting elected governor and running for president or it`s just a jump. I mean, it`s not even from college to the NFL. It`s more from like junior high school to NFL.</p><p>And I think that he has this problem that the Republican Party has, he doesn`t really have any policy. So, he`s out there talking about stuff like most of these Republicans that people ultimately just don`t care that much about.</p><p>You know, and I call it sort of a bathrooms and bedrooms tour, and you`re not going to get elected president of the United States. And so, you start talking about something that`s really important to more people than not, and that`s not what he`s doing.</p><p>HAYES: Well, that`s interesting you say it, because I really think this is one of the defining features of the Republican Party right now, is just sort of -- the sort of questions of high salience, low salience issues, what are people talking about.</p><p>And the degree to which a lot of them really do seem kind of trapped in their own bubble, about what people care about, that does seem increasingly detached from again, the kind of voters in that, you know, that focus group who are gettable voters, these are persuadable voters, these are not doctrinaire liberals. These are not people that are like never going to take a look at a Republican candidate. But you got to kind of talk to what they`re worried about.</p><p>STEVENS: What`s happening in the Republican Party is what happens in all extremist movements. It becomes a purity test and the purity test that you passed and you showed up perfectly when he signed the 15-week ban.</p><p>The purity tests that you passed last year isn`t good enough now with extremist, and this is what happens. I mean, this is the same path of the Red Guard, the Khmer Rouge, you know, it`s why they`re against education.</p><p>And until there`s an intervening force, which I believe in the Republican Party is only going to be crushing defeat after crushing defeat after crushing defeat. Will the party began to change?</p><p>[20:40:07]</p><p>Because there`s -- we`ve proven that there`s nothing inside the party, there are no leaders, there are no principles that are going to be -- principles they can cross or leaders that will stand up and say enough, this is what the party is for.</p><p>So, you just have this vacuum. And the most extreme are the people who are filling the space.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, the only -- I think -- I think you`re right, that multiple defeats, I thought that there might be some course correction where it was at least possible with multiple defeats.</p><p>I think luckily, we`re very long way from the Red Guard. But let`s hopefully keep it that way, the Khmer Rouge.</p><p>Stuart Stevens, thank you very much.</p><p>STEVENS: Thank you.</p><p>HAYES: Still to come, for someone who positions himself as a \"law and order politician\", Texas Governor Greg Abbott sure seems eager to pardon a convicted killer.

At issue is the move by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu currently indicted on corruption charges and facing trial, the attempts by his right-wing government to eliminate the independence of the Israeli judiciary to basically get rid of what is now the only substantial institutional check on the power of the government.</p><p>It`s led to hundreds of thousands of protesters flooding the streets, military reservists refusing to serve. The National Labor Federation calling for a strike.</p><p>Now, in response to the extraordinary outcry, Netanyahu backed off a bit, suspending the implementation of the plan until the parliament meets again, a little over two weeks from today.</p><p>The country appears to be on a kind of precipice, amidst yet another round of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>To sort through this, I talked to Edo Konrad, the editor-in-chief of an English language online publication about Israel and Palestine, called +972 Magazine on my podcast, why is this happening? I asked him about his perspective on these protests as a member of the Israeli left.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDO KONRAD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, +972 MAGAZINE: The Israeli public has woken up to what it means to have far right -- the far right run its country. And they`ve started to wake up to realize, OK, these people have been kind of waiting in the wings, building their power for decades.</p><p>If I can make an analogy to the -- to the United States and to the conservatives into the Republican Party, the attempt to enshrine minoritarian rule, right, like this attempt to like in the United States to take over state legislatures and to ensure that next time there`s an election to make sure that the Republicans are able to basically stop the count or reverse the count or, you know, make sure that that a Democratic candidate is not elected.</p><p>It`s different in the Israeli system. But the logic is the same, to ensure far-right minoritarian rule forever in the court, I think is one of the things that really stops the far-right from achieving that goal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: You can scan the Q.R. code on your screen right now to listen that full episode and find Why Is This Happening wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[20:52:21]</p><p>HAYES: One week ago, a Texas man named Daniel Perry was convicted of murder. He hasn`t been sentenced yet. But Texas Governor Greg Abbott already says he wants to pardon him.</p><p>And to be clear, this is not a case of someone being wrongfully convicted. No one is disputing that in 2020 Perry drove his car into a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters in Austin, Texas, before shooting and killing a man named Garrett Foster.</p><p>Perry`s legal defense rested on Texas`s standard ground laws, which allow residents to kill someone in an act of self-defense.</p><p>Perry`s lawyers noted that Garrett Foster was carrying a rifle that time, something he was legally allowed to do in the state of Texas, which has some of the loosest gun laws in the nation.</p><p>But crucially, witnesses say Foster never raised the gun. And jurors just didn`t buy the self-defense argument, they convicted him.</p><p>It`s in part because Perry sent messages to friends that read \"might go to Dallas to shoot looters\" and, \"might have to kill a few people on my way to work, they are rioting outside my apartment complex\".</p><p>Yesterday, a newly unsealed court filing revealed Perry conducted online searches for terms like protests tonight, protesters in Seattle getting shot and riot shootouts, as well as social media posts where Perry compared BLM protesters to monkeys, zoo animals declared himself a racist, expressed a desire to hunt Muslims.</p><p>Now, some of that information was not made available to the jury which convicted Perry regardless, this information is publicly available.</p><p>The idea that Greg Abbott is unaware of these messages and searches really stretches credulity. In fact, they could be one reason why folks like Tucker Carlson are pushing so hard for Abbott to pardon Perry. Something Tucker Carlson did before Abbott announced his intentions to do so.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: So, this is a legal atrocity. It`s so obviously unjust, that (INAUDIBLE) extended the invitation to the sitting governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, to come on this show on Monday.</p><p>And we wanted to ask if he was considering a pardon for Daniel Perry. But for some reason, Governor Greg Abbott`s office told us he just can`t make it and that we should talk to the Attorney General of Texas, Ken Paxton, instead. So, that is Greg Abbott`s position.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Less than 24 hours after that aired on Fox, Governor Abbott announced his intentions to pursue a pardon for Daniel Perry. This is just the latest example of a really really chilling trend among the political right to excuse or embrace deadly right-wing vigilantism.</p><p>There`s a real argument among some conservatives, they should, first of all, be able to hoard guns, and then crucially use those guns to shoot protesters? Shoot liberals and that should be legal to do so? The theory Greg Abbott is appears to be effectively endorsing now.</p><p>[20:55:08]</p><p>Sarah Jones is a senior writer at New York Magazine. Her latest piece on this frightening trend is titled The United States of vigilantes and she joins me now.</p><p>Sarah, I`m always a big fan of your writing. I thought what you have to say here was really good. How did this case become this sort of cause celeb?</p><p>SARAH JONES, SENIOR WRITER, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: I think because there were so many parallels to the case of Kyle Rittenhouse from several years ago who also became something of a hero to the right after he shot three protesters and killed two in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p><p>So, the president was already there. It was already established and I think everything kind of fell into place after Perry`s conviction.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, and I should show you that they made this parallel quite clear. Here is Tucker Carlson interviewing Kyle Rittenhouse precisely to draw this connection. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I wanted to speak to one of the few people who knows tonight with Daniel Perry is going through, sitting behind bars for defending himself. Kyle Rittenhouse with that experience.</p><p>How do you think Daniel Perry feels tonight sitting in jail?</p><p>KYLE RITTENHOUSE: I can only imagine he`s probably sitting there wondering what happened. He defended himself, he knows what he did was right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAYES: Of course, that argument was presented to the jury, which convicted him none the less. What is the implication? And what does it mean to see this now become something of a trend that these figures are held up not just as they shouldn`t be convicted, but as actual heroes, right? People to look up to and to emulate?</p><p>JONES: Right, the implication of what Carlson and Rittenhouse are saying is that Perry was morally justified in what he did. And that`s what I find most disturbing about all of this.</p><p>It casts any sort of dissent or criticism of the right and the conservative project as being illegitimate.</p><p>HAYES: Say more about that.</p><p>JONES: I see in these attempts to pardon Perry, a bigger attempt to eradicate dissent, to crack down on it to intimidate people and scare them away from protesting in the streets.</p><p>I think when that happens, we have to ask ourselves, you know, about the health of our democracy at large, and whether the right really has the best interest of our democracy at heart.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, this sort of -- there`s two things happening here, right? There`s a sort of fetishization of the gun and the vigilante figure, but they`re also this really, really obsessive, almost neurotic obsession with the protesters and particularly protests in 2020.</p><p>And one of the things we saw, you know, after 2020, where all these laws being passed in states that would make it more -- you would have a defense if you ran protesters over, that, like, the protests themselves represent this kind of existential threat and disorder that has to be crushed, and that view seems like a mainstream view on the right.</p><p>JONES: It absolutely does. And I think it`s become more and more apparent over time, we saw it particularly pronounced in 2020, where I note in my article, there were over 70 incidents of cars ramming into crowds of Black Lives Matter protests within a very short period of time in 2020 alone.</p><p>So, not only is this view becoming mainstream, but people are acting on it, and people will be injured more and people will be killed.</p><p>HAYES: There`s also in the details of the Perry case to me, you know, the Rittenhouse case, I think I was skeptical of whether the jury reached the right conclusion there. I didn`t think they did.</p><p>But in the Perry case, the record itself and the facts, I mean, this is someone who literally was like, I`m going to go shoot some protesters (INAUDIBLE) protesters, like the factual record here and the record that`s now been made released public, Abbott going along with a party in that context is pretty appalling.</p><p>JONES: It is, and I think it shows the degree to which the contemporary GOP has been captured by extremist elements within the party, where somebody like Tucker Carlson can have such an outsized role and influence the decisions of the sitting politician like Greg Abbott.</p><p>It really seems like its figures like Tucker Carlson that are steering the party where it`s going to be going for the next few years. And that`s really concerning.</p><p>HAYES: Yes, it does seem to me there`s also political space here for a battle over this. This is -- Texas is a place that has a somewhat attenuated pardon process on like other states, it`s not the unilateral power of the governor, he`s going to depend on a recommendation from a pardon board.</p><p>So, it does seem like there`s political space for people in Texas, particularly to make their voices heard about whether they think this is an appropriate use of that power.</p><p>JONES: I think that space exist, and it`s incredibly important to defend that space for as long as it exists.</p><p>I think those protesters are now contending with a governor who`s tried to chill whatever they might do in the future to influence him or to influence other members of his party. And that`s one of the things I found about his decision to preemptively announce his decision to pardon Perry.</p><p>[21:00:10]</p><p>HAYES: All right, Sarah Jones, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.</p><p>That is ALL IN for this week. \"ALEX WAGNER TONIGHT\" starts right now. Good evening, Alex.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

By 2022, Chengdu Institute is expected to gather more than 2,000 people, and it will drive the entrepreneurship and employment of more than 50,000 scientific and technological talents.</p><p>The \"miracle\" of Chengdu Institute is that, in less than two years since its establishment, it has used AI and 5G technologies to provide solutions in many fields such as education, medical care, agriculture, drones, poverty alleviation, and emergency response.</p><p>The 5G ambulance of Chengdu Institute can realize admission on board. Through the 5G signal provided on the ambulance, the patient's examination data can be transmitted to the hospital in real time, so that diagnosis and treatment can be started as long as the patient gets on board. In the rescue of the Changning earthquake in Yibin, the 5G ambulance allowed medical experts to conduct remote consultations on the two wounded far from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital in Chengdu. This is the first time that 5G technology has been used for disaster relief in the world. The 5G ambulance had also successfully provided emergency support for the military parade held to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of People's Republic of China and the 2nd China International Import Expo.</p><p>5G networked drones are also used in emergency rescue, high-rise fire protection, forest fire prevention, disaster assessment and other scenarios. Recently, wildfires broke out suddenly in some areas of Xichang in Liangshan and Mianyang. Chengdu Institute assisted in the rescue, provided bases for decision-making for the local emergency command, and participated in the fire extinguishment successfully. As of April 28, 35 sorties had been flown, effectively extinguishing the fire at five large smoke spots.</p><p>Gioneco National Headquarters Base: A deep integration of AI and rail transit\u00a0</p><p>Gioneco National Headquarters Base is located in the AI International Hub. Gioneco has been focusing on smart transportation for ten years. By integrating the world's leading AI technology with rail transit in depth, Gioneco has comprehensively promoted the construction of new urban rail transit infrastructure, and built up a \"5G + AI-based\" holographic dynamic perception ecosystem for smart transportation management and passenger service in the public transport fields such as subway, creating a safer and more convenient travel scenario and a happier life for people.</p><p>In 2019, Gioneco became the first company to launch the face-recognition pass technology at Zhengzhou subways stations. On July 1, 2020, Gioneco first launched the face-recognition pass technology with the mask and put it into use on the entire network in Harbin. People do not need to take off their masks when entering or leaving the subway. The verification can be completed in 0.2 seconds facing the PAD. This technology can also be applied to high-speed trains, airports, communities and other scenarios, which will greatly reduce passengers' waiting time in public places, reduce the risk of cross-infection during COVID-19, and effectively protect citizens' travel safety.</p><p>At present, Gioneco's businesses have covered nearly 50% of the cities with subways in China, and diversified mobile payment methods have been applied to more than 500 subway stations nationwide, creating multiple \"groundbreaking achievements in the industry of rail transit\". In addition to the QR scanning/face-recognition passage technologies that are intuitively visual to passengers, the urban traffic data brain and smart security inspection and protection facilities developed by Gioneco have also changed the lives of more people in a quiet manner.</p><p>SinoVision China R&amp;D Center: an AI-based security decision-making platform\u00a0</p><p>In the AI International Hub, the Singapore Innovation Center was established to promote exchanges and cooperation between China and Singapore, and it has settled many Singapore projects in Chengdu, including SinoVision Technology Pte. Ltd., an AI company from Singapore.</p><p>Relying the AI International Hub as the base of its R&amp;D center, SinoVision independently developed the \"Ultimo\" AI-based security decision-making platform, which can provide users with one-stop AI solutions.</p><p>This AI product has been used in the headquarters of Singapore's second largest bank, United Overseas Bank (UOB), and a number of its commercial real estates. Now a visitor can enter the UOB Building without using an ID card or a traditional pass card, but by face recognition directly.</p><p>While obtaining the access permission, the face information of the visitor will also be recorded by the Ultimo system. If the visitor violates the safety rules in the building, such as trying to enter the restricted area or staying in the building for long, the system will quickly capture the violation behavior and transmit the location information through the surveillance cameras in the building, and notify the security guards to take corresponding measures, which is more intelligent compared with traditional security means.</p><p>Building an \"AI + 5G\" Industry Cluster with \"Magical\" Institutes\u00a0</p><p>In addition to Chengdu Institute, SinoVision China R &amp; D Center, and ZONE National Headquarters Base, the AI International Hub has also introduced H3C Chengdu Research Institute, Amazon AWS Cloud Innovation Center, NSFOCUS's No. 2 Headquarters Base and other enterprises and R&amp;D centers since its official opening in 2019.</p><p>In 2020, Chengdu was approved to build a national-level AI industrial innovation demonstration zone. The construction of new infrastructure will also bring a new trend of AI and 5G promotion. As the first \"AI + 5G\" concept-based industrial park in Western China, the AI International Hub and the enterprises and institutes in it will effectively play their \"magical\" technology advantages to promote the regional economic development.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CN67678&amp;sd=2020-07-22\"/> View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-visit-to-the-ai-international-hub-of-china-reveals-how-the-magical-institutes-are-changing-peoples-lives-301096579.html</p><p>SOURCE Chengdu Tianfu Software Park</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN67678&amp;Transmission_Id=202007222230PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN67678&amp;DateId=20200722\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Lijuan Wang, +86-18982108031</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-CN6767820200722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-JW71-JB72-12HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1187\"/><timeReceived>10:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the past two weeks, one out of every 100 county residents has tested positive. The true number of infections is likely 10 times that number. Local hospitals are overwhelmed, as our most other hospitals in the State. If you need emergency care for COVID or anything else, access to that care is no longer assured.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How did this happen and what can we do about it?</p><p>The current surge in COVID-19 cases is a self-inflicted wound. We had the vaccine supply and delivery system in place to immunize 85 percent of residents 12 and older by mid-July. This effort faltered because of a toxic mix of disinformation and distrust. To make matters worse, activity restrictions and masking requirements were prematurely ended in late Spring just as the highly infectious Delta Variant spread through the State.</p><p>Ongoing requirements that unvaccinated individuals continue to mask indoors were routinely ignored. People returned to their pre-pandemic lives. And Delta began to burn through the community, like a mindless, raging fire in a bone-dry forest.</p><p>We are now encircled by the blazing fire. Public health agencies are called upon to contain this fire, to coordinate a community response, and to protect the vulnerable \u2014 children, the frail elderly, and the many people who have chosen to remain unvaccinated. And while many have mobilized to address this common threat, something else, both dangerous and perverse is going on.</p><p>As the fire rages, voices on social media decry the fire as a hoax. Others try to wrestle the firehoses out of the hands of the fire fighters. Still others insist on their constitutional right to start fires, pour gasoline on existing blazes, and rush into burning buildings.</p><p>This analogy tragically describes our current pandemic response. Some political leaders call for a ban on mask mandates, citizens loudly defend their right to infect others in the name of personal choice, and people absurdly equate vaccination requirements for some occupations to the worst horrors of the World War II holocaust.</p><p>COVID lessons</p><p>This is no way to end a pandemic. There is another way. We start with what we have learned so far:</p><p>1) COVID is caused by an airborne virus, mostly spread by unvaccinated people in indoor spaces before they know they are infected.</p><p>2) The Delta Variant is highly transmissible. Things that people have been able to do without getting infected earlier in the pandemic are now resulting in infection. When one member of a household gets it, everyone else in the family is usually infected.</p><p>3) Vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death. They are incredibly safe \u2013 among the safest vaccines ever developed. They are less effective at preventing all forms of illness. They do not work for everyone \u2014 some vaccinated individuals have no protection at all. Their effectiveness may diminish over time.</p><p>4) COVID-19 is not like influenza. After invading our bodies through the respiratory tract, it attacks our circulatory system causing kidney, heart, and brain damage in addition to the life-threatening complication of COVID pneumonia. Survivors have a 10- to 30-percent chance of lingering symptoms, some disabling.</p><p>5) The amount of virus we are exposed to makes a difference, both in terms of getting infected and how severe that infection is. Masks, distancing, improved ventilation, and moving social gatherings outdoors all reduce the exposure risk. None offer 100 percent protection but do dilute the virus concentration enough to prevent serious infection, even in the unvaccinated.</p><p>'Future is unwritten'</p><p>Embrace these facts and you can safely navigate the remaining months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Ignore them and it is just a matter of time before you become infected and likely spread that infection to friends and family. And the worst time to get infected is at the peak of a pandemic surge when medical systems are overwhelmed. Treatment for COVID has improved dramatically but may not be available if our hospitals are overwhelmed with cases.</p><p>No forest fire burns forever and so too all pandemics eventually come to an end. Globally COVID-19 will burn for years. In the U.S. we have the technological capability to contain this pandemic in a matter of months.</p><p>The unanswered question is do we have the wisdom, compassion and political will to do it. Right now, the answer seems to be no. But the future is unwritten. Vaccination levels are starting to rise. We are learning more about the virus every day.</p><p>\"Personal choice\" does not include the right to spread infection recklessly. It does involve the responsibility to make wise and responsible choices. We need to support the brave firefighters who battle the COVID blaze.</p><p>The majority of Clallam County residents are sane, responsible and community-minded. They need to reject the misguided obstructionism of those who aren't.</p><p>Dr. Locke served as health officer for Clallam County from 1987-2015 and for Jefferson County from 1996-2021. He is board certified in preventive medicine and public health and has 45 years of experience as a practicing physician.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Sequim Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEQGAZ-news20210908PYC4209841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEQGAZ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JR-0FP1-F0HF-810V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"862\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.
