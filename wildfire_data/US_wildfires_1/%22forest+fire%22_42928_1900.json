Since our founding, our civic responsibilities have been a fundamental part of education, however in recent decades we have strayed from these basic education requirements. Foundational civic education in our high schools will aid our students with a better understanding of our government institutions and their critical role in American society.</p><p>\"Additionally, I'm thrilled Utah State University is taking the lead to pilot a redesign of general education through the new center for civics excellence. This center will be tasked with building out a general education curriculum focused on viewpoint diversity, civil discourse and helping our students develop the analytical skills necessary to contribute in the public square. This curriculum will be a model for all our public institutions in Utah and nationally.\"</p><p>Gov. Cox issued a veto of S.B. 37, Minimum Basic Tax Rate Amendments.

He explained some of the science behind fire behavior, the role of landscape, and the challenges posed by urban areas to fire management. He also shared his insights related to preventative measures communities can take, including the use of prescribed burning.</p><p>Takeaways</p><p>Wildfires in California are influenced by unique climatic conditions, specifically previous seasons of above average rainfall leading to increased vegetation and the current season having low relative humidity, dry conditions, and high winds.</p><p>Fire behavior can be greatly affected by fuel type, weather, and topography as well as urban and suburban environments, which often enhance the fire's intensity and rate of spread. While some of these factors can help predict a fire's behavior, when combined, they can create unpredictable scenarios.</p><p>Community resilience in fire-prone areas can include homeowners creating defensible spaces around their properties, the use of fire-resistant materials when building, and prescribed fires, which can decrease fuels while also promoting ecosystem health.</p><p>About Coates</p><p>Coates is an associate professor of wildland fire ecology and management in the Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation for Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment. Coates' research focuses on the impacts of wildland fire on ecosystem processes and properties. That focus intersects with topics such as restoration ecology, fuels, fire behavior, silviculture, soils, wildlife habitat, and water quality.</p><p>Learn more</p><p>Expert shares factors increasing forest fire ignitions</p><p>Wildfire season heats up; expert offers advice for community preparedness</p><p>Burning Issues - Virginia Tech Magazine</p><p>About the podcast</p><p>\"Curious Conversations\" is a series of free-flowing conversations with Virginia Tech researchers that take place at the intersection of world-class research and everyday life. Produced and hosted by Travis Williams, assistant director of marketing and communications for the Office of Research and Innovation, university researchers share their expertise and motivations as well as the practical applications of their work in a format that more closely resembles chats at a cookout than classroom lectures.

He explained some of the science behind fire behavior, the role of landscape, and the challenges posed by urban areas to fire management. He also shared his insights related to preventative measures communities can take, including the use of prescribed burning.</p><p>Takeaways</p><p>Wildfires in California are influenced by unique climatic conditions, specifically previous seasons of above average rainfall leading to increased vegetation and the current season having low relative humidity, dry conditions, and high winds.</p><p>Fire behavior can be greatly affected by fuel type, weather, and topography as well as urban and suburban environments, which often enhance the fire's intensity and rate of spread. While some of these factors can help predict a fire's behavior, when combined, they can create unpredictable scenarios.</p><p>Community resilience in fire-prone areas can include homeowners creating defensible spaces around their properties, the use of fire-resistant materials when building, and prescribed fires, which can decrease fuels while also promoting ecosystem health.</p><p>About Coates</p><p>Coates is an associate professor of wildland fire ecology and management in the Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation for Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment. Coates' research focuses on the impacts of wildland fire on ecosystem processes and properties. That focus intersects with topics such as restoration ecology, fuels, fire behavior, silviculture, soils, wildlife habitat, and water quality.</p><p>Learn more</p><p>Expert shares factors increasing forest fire ignitions</p><p>Wildfire season heats up; expert offers advice for community preparedness</p><p>Burning Issues Virginia Tech Magazine</p><p>About the podcast</p><p>\"Curious Conversations\" is a series of free-flowing conversations with Virginia Tech researchers that take place at the intersection of world-class research and everyday life. Produced and hosted by Travis Williams, assistant director of marketing and communications for the Office of Research and Innovation, university researchers share their expertise and motivations as well as the practical applications of their work in a format that more closely resembles chats at a cookout than classroom lectures.

As part of that plan, a new online information portal is designed to help the public understand and reduce fire risk, Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette announced today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following a very active wildfire year in 2023, the Forest Fire Service is introducing the New Jersey Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (NJWRAP) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://newjerseywildfirerisk.com/\">https://newjerseywildfirerisk.com/</url>), which compiles data and resources to assist residents, community leaders and fire professionals in taking actions to mitigate the threat of wildfire risk. Data in the new portal will also assist the Forest Fire Service to identify areas where prescribed burning may help mitigate wildfire risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Prescribed fire not only fosters resilience and diversity in the landscape, but also helps to safeguard our communities,\" Commissioner LaTourette said. \"By executing planned prescribed fires throughout New Jersey's wooded areas, we are limiting the risk of a catastrophic release of carbon during a wildfire.\"</p><p>Locations where prescribed burns are taking place can be viewed on the Prescribed Fire Notifications (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/rxb.html\">https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/rxb.html</url>) map at njwildfire.org. Additionally, daily notifications are posted on the DEP Forest Fire Service's Facebook (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService\">https://www.facebook.com/NJForestFireService</url>) and X (formerly Twitter) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/njdepforestfire\">https://twitter.com/njdepforestfire</url>) accounts. Text or email notifications of prescribed burns are also available by signing up via this link (<url normalizedValue=\"https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/NJDEP/subscriber/new\">https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/NJDEP/subscriber/new</url>).</p><p>In 2024, the Forest Fire Service intends to treat 25,000 acres of forests, grasslands and marsh with prescribed fire. Meeting the targeted acreage will depend on favorable weather conditions from October through April, when most prescribed burning takes place in New Jersey.</p><p>Coming off an abnormally active fire year in 2023, with 1,194 wildfires burning in excess of 18,000 acres, makes the need for prescribed fire more important than ever.</p><p>\"In 2023 we saw the busiest wildfire year in over 20 years with 14 major wildfires burning across New Jersey threatening over 200 homes, forcing evacuations and closing roads,\" said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests &amp; Historic Sites. \"The Forest Fire Service is ever vigilant in their efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires, especially through the use of prescribed burning.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>About Prescribed Burning</p><p>Prescribed burning is the practice of setting fires in forests or grasslands under well-defined and strategically planned conditions to achieve land management objectives. In addition to reducing the presence of wildland fire fuels, prescribed burning improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>Most of the Forest Fire Service's burns in 2024 will occur on state-owned property such as state forests, parks and wildlife management areas, but the Forest Fire Service also assists private landowners, nonprofit organizations, as well as county and municipal governments to meet their management objectives through prescribed burning. Landowners interested in the Forest Fire Service's assistance in conducting a prescribed burn on their property may contact their local Forest Fire Service office (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/about/contact.html\">https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/about/contact.html</url>).</p><p>Last year, the Forest Fire Service completed prescribed burns on 21,407 acres -- 14,004 acres of state-owned lands and 7,403 acres of privately owned property.</p><p>Several climatological and environmental conditions, all of which influence a fire's intensity and severity, are considered when conducting prescribed burns to accomplish various resource and ecological objectives, such as reducing hazard fuels and managing habitats. The Forest Fire Service and DEP's Air Quality Regulation and Planning office work together to assess current and predicted air quality to determine the best days to conduct prescribed burning, to minimize air quality impacts. Other factors considered include the density and arrangement of the vegetation being burned. Current air quality information can be found here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://dep.nj.gov/airplanning/aqi-today/\">https://dep.nj.gov/airplanning/aqi-today/</url>).</p><p>While most prescribed burning takes place during the spring, a prescribed burn may be implemented in the summer or fall depending on the management objective for a particular area. The Prescribed Burn Act authorized the Forest Fire Service to use prescribed burning as a tool to meet a wider range of management objectives designed to improve forest health and conditions for plants and animals. For example, prescribed burning can be effective in managing the spread of nonnative invasive species or managing grasslands for threatened or endangered bird species.</p><p>Most prescribed burning takes place throughout the New Jersey Pinelands, an ecosystem which needs fire to thrive. Pitch pine, the dominant species of pine in New Jersey, have serotinous cones, which means they remain closed until exposed to high heat from fire, at which point they release their seeds. Additionally, pitch pine trees can sprout new growth from their roots or stump, allowing them to quickly recover and colonize a burned area.</p><p>Motorists are reminded to use caution when approaching areas where prescribed burns are taking place, pay attention to reduced speed limits and be alert to the presence of Forest Fire Service vehicles, equipment and personnel that may be working alongside roadways.</p><p>New Jerseyans are reminded that peak wildfire season often directly follows prescribed burn season. When in doubt about the source of smoke or whether a fire is part of a prescribed burning operation, call 1-877-WARN-DEP (1-877-927-6337) or 911.</p><p>* * *</p><p>About the Portal</p><p>Residents, community leaders and fire professionals may use NJWRAP to access resources regarding wildfire threats to homes and business and find out how to mitigate risk.</p><p>The concept of wildfire hazard and risk information provided in NJWRAP are not new, but the innovative tools in the portal are more advanced, precise and easier to navigate than what was previously available. Data and preparedness resources presented in the portal were developed by the nation's wildfire experts with Forest Fire Service personnel providing practical and local information.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service will update the portal's tools and data based on user need and on-the-ground changes to the landscape. NJWRAP was made possible through partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>\"The Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal is a powerful tool for residents, community leaders and fire professionals to learn about risk from wildfire, and the steps they can take to protect family and community,\" said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator for Forests &amp; Natural Lands. \"Nearly a quarter of all homes in New Jersey are built in an area known as the wildland-urban interface, also known as the area where development is intertwined with forested land.\"</p><p>In addition to the portal, the Forest Fire Service has several other useful tools on its website to keep New Jersey residents informed, including the Fire Danger Dashboard (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/conditions-restrictions.html\">https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/conditions-restrictions.html</url>) and the Prescribed Fire Notifications Map (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/rxb.html\">https://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/infotools/rxb.html</url>).</p><p>New Jerseyans are reminded that peak wildfire season often directly follows prescribed burn season.

French In the wake of California's devastating wildfires, New Jersey's governor is worried neighboring New York is unprepared to fight fires along their shared border. Gov. Phil Murphy used a Thursday press conference on wildfire readiness to say New York's lack of a state fire service is \"beyond belief.\" The comments come just three months after firefighters from both states struggled to contain a 5,000-acre blaze along their forested border in the northern part of New Jersey. </p><p>The November fire, which started near the state border , burned for two weeks before it was contained. Murphy, a Democrat, called his state's own 60-person statewide Forest Fire Service a \"gem\" and lambasted New York for not having a similar agency. \"We were battling some serious fires on the New York state border and it was, fair to say, incredibly challenging because they don't have what we have,\" he said. \"You think that's crazy? New York's got almost 20 million people - they don't have a state forest fire service and that made that really hard and I would argue it took longer to get that under control because of that than it otherwise should have.\" The border fire, known as the Jennings Creek Fire, was the largest in New York since 2008, prompted evacuations and killed one New York state park employee battling it. In New York, the state Department of Environmental Conservation coordinates wildfire responses on state lands but largely relies on assistance from local fire departments to fight the fires. All of the state's roughly 150 forest rangers are trained to respond to wildfires, but they have many other responsibilities - from rescuing hikers to patrolling state lands - over 6 million acres. Murphy's comments were remarkably pointed given the usual emphasis states have on cooperation during emergencies. He and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat, have a generally good relationship, but it's been fractured by interstate squabbles over policing their shared waterfront and new tolls on New Jersey drivers. On Thursday afternoon, spokespeople for both governors tried to keep the wildfire remarks from becoming a major spat, with both offices praising the other state's firefighters' partnership and coordination. \"From the start of the fire, our administration launched a coordinated response with every available resource to help our first responders contain the fire, and this could not be possible without working in close coordination with our partners in New Jersey,\" said Paul DeMichele, spokesperson for Hochul. \"We are thankful for our partnership with New Jersey and we will always work together whenever a fire or other natural disaster threatens communities in our states.\" Murphy spokesperson Stella Porter said the governor \"is grateful for the partnership and communication between New Jersey and New York when a fire threatens communities in both states, as we saw during the Jennings Creek Wildfire.\" The exact cause of that fire is still under investigation - including which side of the border it started on, according to New York DEC. The Empire State is far larger than New Jersey, noted New York Democratic state Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents Westchester County. While a state fire service might make sense in a small geographic area with different topography, Harckham said it might not be the best approach in New York. Still, the lawmaker said New York should study what's needed to respond to a growing risk of wildfires driven by climate change. \"I usually don't pay any attention to what Phil Murphy says,\" Harckham said. \"It's not like we don't have capabilities and protocols in place - the fire services do. The question is, given climate change, do we have enough? And I think the answer is no.\" California - which is about three times larger than New York - has a state fire service. \"We just don't in one budget say we're going to stand up a statewide fire service,\" Harckham said. \"We need to really have a statewide strategy to respond to the new landscape.\" The union representing DEC's forest rangers and law enforcement officers has been critical of low staffing levels to gain the experience necessary to respond to fires in New York, a union official said months before the Jennings Creek Fire. \"We have members that are wildfire qualified that could go but were denied because of short staffing,\" said Matt Krug, an environmental conservation officer and union representative. In addition to more than 150 forest ranger personnel trained to fight wildfires, more than 100 other DEC staff have that training, according to the department. Forest rangers also do prescribed burns to reduce the risk of fires on public lands. The department also enforces burn restrictions and runs education efforts. On large wildfires, multiple New York agencies assist in the response led by forest rangers and the state can request assistance via multistate and federal agreements. Mayor Michele Dale of West Milford, a New Jersey town near the border fire, said it was very difficult for firefighters to work together at first \"because the way they fight fires is not the way New Jersey approaches a wildfire.\" During a call as the fire raged, Dale urged Murphy to work something out so New Jersey could help New York. \"I said, 'Look, we kind of need to take control of this because we cannot keep waiting for New York resources,'\" Dale recalled in an interview. Murphy's appearance at a roundtable in Burlington County to talk about wildfires might seem unusual given major winter storms that have just swept through the state and other things going on in the world. But the governor said two things were on his mind: last year was the driest fall on record in the state and the Los Angeles fires. \"You can't answer something with nothing,\" he said. Murphy's focus on New York represents something of a shift in Garden State officials' wildfire worries. Fires are more common in the state's more rural south. But the border fire last fall was in the north, closer to major population centers. While New Jersey's most famous borders with New York are waterways - New York Harbor and the Hudson River - the states also share a 50-mile land border, much of which is forested. It's part of that area that burned last fall.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000019504ffd573a3bf55ffefc80000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB9-B443-RRSV-000C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 14, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Jharkhand, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The escalating global threat of forest fires, driven by global warming, requires the development of effective prediction systems to mitigate damages. This research focuses on Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in central India, where forest fire risk has become particularly pronounced.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Birla Institute of Technology (BIT, Mesra, Ranchi). <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Birla Institute of Technology, \"The primary objectives of the study are to quantify and map the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fires over the period 2001 to 2020, and to predict future fire risks using satellite derived datasets and machine learning techniques. Through a long-term analysis, the study revealed an alarming increase in the number of forest fire incidents in MP and CG. From an average of 1200 and 1000 during 2001 to 2005, the incidents increased to 2800 and 2100 during 2016 to 2020, in MP and CG respectively. To predict forest fire risk, Random Forest machine learning algorithm was adopted utilizing various satellite derived climatic, topographical, and ecological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, NDVI, soil moisture, litter availability, evapotranspiration and terrain parameters (at monthly scale for 20 years). While forecasting fire probability for 2018-2020, the model achieves high accuracy rate of 86.46 % in MP and 93.78 % in CG. The results highlight significant forest fire likelihood regions in the central MP and the Southern CG, identifying areas requiring enhanced fire management strategies. This study has revealed that NDVI and rainfall have played a positive role in restricting the forest fire, and their negative anomaly amplified the fire risk.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The study would help forest planners and administrators to characterise vulnerable areas and prioritise their conservation provisions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Using Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm To Predict Forest Fire Occurrence Probability In Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, India.

According to news reporting originating from Hangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest is an important resource for human survival, and forest fires are a serious threat to forest protection. Therefore, the early detection of fire and smoke is particularly important.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Innovation And Entrepreneurship Training Program; Industry-university-research Innovation Fund of Chinese Colleges. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Zhejiang University of Science and Technology: \"Based on the manually set feature extraction method, the detection accuracy of the machine learning forest fire detection method is limited, and it is unable to deal with complex scenes. Meanwhile, most deep learning methods are difficult to deploy due to high computational costs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight forest fire detection model based on YOLOv8 (FFYOLO). Firstly, in order to better extract the features of fire and smoke, a channel prior dilatation attention module (CPDA) is proposed. Secondly, the mixed-classification detection head (MCDH), a new detection head, is designed. Furthermore, MPDIoU is introduced to enhance the regression and classification accuracy of the model. Then, in the Neck section, a lightweight GSConv module is applied to reduce parameters while maintaining model accuracy.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Finally, the knowledge distillation strategy is used during training stage to enhance the generalization ability of the model and reduce the false detection. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that, in comparison to the original model, FFYOLO realizes an mAP [ [0.5] ] of 88.8% on a custom forest fire dataset, which is 3.4% better than the original model, with 25.3% lower parameters and 9.3% higher frames per second (FPS).\" <br/> For more information on this research see: FFYOLO: A Lightweight Forest Fire Detection Model Based on YOLOv8.

According to news reporting from North Bay, Canada, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Understanding past fire regimes requires reliable proxy data that record fire conditions and preserve them over time.\" </p><p><br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Nipissing University: \"The objective of this study was to determine if the oxygen isotope composition of charred bark samples (pyrogenic organic matter) could be used as proxy data to differentiate wildfires based on burn intensity. We collected charred and uncharred bark samples from three fire sites in northern Ontario, Canada that represented a gradient of fire intensity as depicted by Fire Weather Index (FWI) data. We hypothesized that the mean D18Obark-char (the difference between d18O of uncharred bark and a charred sample) would be greater for fires with higher intensities. Analysis of variance of D18Obark-char indicated a significant effect of fire event (F=73.6, p&lt;0.001), which explained 57.0 % of the variance.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"A prescribed surface fire treatment (mean FWI = 9.5) had significantly lower D18Obark-char than two natural crown fires (FWI = 21 and 27). These results demonstrate that D18Obark-char differentiated moderate from high intensity fires in a similar manner to the FWI data.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Differences in the intensity of past forest fire events inferred from stable oxygen isotope analysis of charred bark.

According to news originating from Kathmandu, Nepal, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The Chure region, among the world's youngest mountains, stands out as highly susceptible to natural calamities, particularly forest fires. The region has consistently experienced forest fire incidents, resulting in the degradation of valuable natural and anthropogenic resources.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tribhuvan University: \"Despite its vulnerability, there have been limited studies to understand the relationship of various causative factors for the recurring fire problem. Hence, to comprehend the influencing factors for the recurring forest fire problem and its extent, we utilized generalized linear modeling under binary logistic regression to combine the dependent variable of satellite detected fire points and various independent variables. We conducted a variance inflation factor (VIF) test and correlation matrix to identify the 14 suitable variables for the study. The analysis revealed that forest fires occurred mostly during the three pre-monsoon periods and had a significant positive relation with the area under forest, rangeland, bare-grounds, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (P &lt; 0.05). Consequently, our model showed that the probability of fire incidents decreases with elevation, precipitation, and population density (P &lt; 0.05). Among the significant variables, the forest areas emerges as the most influencing factor, followed by precipitation, elevation, area of rangeland, population density, NDVI, and the area of bare ground.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The validation of the model was done through the area under the curve (AUC = 0.92) and accuracy (ACC = 0.89) assessments, which showed the model performed excellently in terms of predictive capabilities. The modeling result and the forest fire susceptible map provide valuable insights into the forest fire vulnerability in the region, offering baseline information about forest fires that will be helpful for line agencies to prepare management strategies to further prevent the deterioration of the region.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest fire vulnerability in Nepal's chure region: Investigating the influencing factors using generalized linear model.

Siberia, a major Arctic wildfire hotspot, is shaped by both local weather and distant climate influences. Here we use climate reanalysis data and numerical model experiments to show that summer wildfires in Siberia are strongly influenced by rainfall patterns over the Tibetan Plateau, one of the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s largest summer heat sources. A dipole in Tibetan Plateau rainfall\u2014wetter in the west, drier in the east\u2014coincides with more fires in central Siberia and fewer in the east. This pattern alters high-altitude winds, shifting the jet stream northward and generating air flow changes that create favorable fire conditions across Siberia. Model experiments support a causal link. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions can match annual emissions from all Nordic countries. These findings highlight an overlooked driver of Arctic wildfires and improve our understanding of their role in the global carbon cycle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildfires intensify in central but weaken in eastern Siberia when midsummer precipitation is above normal in western Tibet and below normal in the east, leading to a northward shift of the jet stream, based on climate reanalysis data and numerical model experiments</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The geographic range of wildfires has continuously expanded towards higher latitudes in recent years, burning permafrost and tundra environments in the Arctic1,2. Arctic wildfires have devastating impacts on natural ecosystems, destroying habitats that many endangered species depend on for survival3. Wildfires rapidly deplete carbon stored in vegetation and soil, causing vegetation degradation, and release large amounts of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere, fueling a vicious cycle that exacerbates climate change4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\u201310. Arctic wildfires are primarily concentrated in Sakha region of Siberia, Russia7,9,11. Previous studies have indicated that, compared with the period 2000\u20132010, the frequency of wildfires in the Sakha tripled between 2010 and 2020 with the total area burned more than doubling, especially in western and central Siberia (CSB)12,13.</p><p>Climate change has intensified compound extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts, resulting in hotter, drier, and longer wildfire seasons11,14,15. Arctic warming has also led to an increase in lightning frequency, further raising the likelihood of natural fires16,17. In addition, Arctic warming weakens the meridional temperature gradient and enhances atmospheric blocking, which fosters warm and dry weather conditions conducive to wildfires18. In the coming years, rising temperatures, increasing lightning frequency, and intensifying heatwaves are likely to continue and escalate, potentially leading to more Arctic wildfires19. It is estimated that the number of Arctic and global wildfires could increase by a third by 205010,20. In addition to local factors, the crucial role of large-scale teleconnection wave trains in regulating Arctic-boreal fires on an interannual scale has been highlighted in recent studies21,22. As a critical conduit for the propagation of teleconnection waves, the dynamic processes associated with jet streams have been identified as key drivers of Siberian wildfires23. However, existing research has given limited attention to the potential impact of signals from regions beyond high latitudes on Siberian wildfires.</p><p>As one of the largest summer heat sources in the Northern Hemisphere during the wildfire season, the intense latent heat released by abundant precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) can disturb the atmosphere and influence remote regions24, 25\u201326. Specifically, the dynamic linkage between TP precipitation and the East Asian subtropical jet stream is widely recognized27, 28, 29\u201330. Compared to the substantial internal atmospheric variability and uncertainty of the jet stream, TP precipitation offers far greater predictability31, 32\u201333. Confirming a causal link between plateau precipitation and Arctic wildfires could significantly enhance our ability to anticipate changes in wildfire activity and assess their impacts.</p><p>Taking advantage of the robust connection between TP precipitation and the East Asian subtropical jet stream, we examine the relationship between TP precipitation and Siberian wildfire patterns using both observational analysis and numerical simulations and identify the associated underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that carbon emissions from Arctic wildfires driven by TP precipitation will increase by ~89.9 million tons per year during the top 5 years with the pronounced TP precipitation dipole pattern; this equates to 2.7 times the total annual emissions of Sweden in 2020. This study provides new insights into understanding the causes of Arctic wildfires and improving the ability to forecast them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>The summer heat source over the TP markedly influences global climate34. Specifically, the latent heat released by precipitation in July and August contributes to this heat source; this differs from the climatic effect observed in June35. Here, we used the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to obtain the dominant spatiotemporal variations in mid-summer (July\u2013August) precipitation over the TP, following the method in previous study35. Figure 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1 display the spatial distributions of the first leading mode (EOF1) of two different precipitation datasets and their associated time series. This mode explained approximately one-third of the total variance of each of the two datasets (34% in GPCP and 30% in CRU), and overall, the two datasets showed similar spatial patterns and temporal variations. Spatially, precipitation varied inversely between southeastern Tibet and Nepal, which lies to the southwest of Tibet. Temporally, both datasets showed similar variations with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (the black line in Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Combining the spatial distributions and associated time series, precipitation increased in southwestern Tibet and decreased in Nepal in years where the time series exhibited positive values. Over the past two decades, almost all extreme floods in Pakistan have occurred in years when the associated time series was positive (e.g., 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022, as shown in Fig. 1f). As an interacting system, this portion of precipitation suppresses moisture transport into the southeastern part of the TP, jointly contributing to the formation of a dipole pattern36, 37\u201338. The immense latent heat released by these extreme precipitation patterns can bring abnormal weather to downstream regions through the propagation of the circum-global wave train33,37; meanwhile, the released heat interaction with the jet stream also suggests that it may markedly influence extreme weather in high-latitude regions39. As shown in Fig. 1d, there is a statistically significant correlation between the seemingly unrelated TP precipitation and Arctic wildfires.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mid-summer Tibetan Plateau (TP) precipitation and its relationship with Siberian wildfires.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Leading empirical orthogonal function mode (EOF1) of TP precipitation in mid-summer from 2001 to 2023 for the CRU dataset. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Annually averaged Active wildfire frequency (AFF, in unit of ignition point numbers) over East Asia in mid-summer from 2001 to 2023. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Percentage of AFF in mid-summer compared with the annual AFF. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Linear regression of mid-summer AFF onto the first principal component (PC1) of TP precipitation.

Black boxes denote the CSB and ESB domains respectively.</p><p>Arctic wildfires mainly occur during mid-summer in the Siberian region, particularly in eastern Siberia (ESB). Here, each 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 grid recorded an average of over 80 ignition points annually (Fig. 1b), with a maximum of up to 900 incidents, accounting for &gt;80% of total annual wildfire occurrences across nearly all analyzed regions at latitudes of 55\u201270\u00b0N. The highest wildfire frequency was observed at ~65\u00b0N, 130\u00b0E. Statistically, wildfire frequency in the Siberian region showed a strong correlation with PC1 of TP precipitation (Fig. 1f). In years with higher PC1 values, wildfires were more active in CSB (55\u201370\u00b0N, 75\u2013115\u00b0E), while the frequency of wildfires in ESB (55\u201370\u00b0N, 115\u2013155\u00b0E) decreased. We defined the difference in wildfire frequency between CSB and ESB as the active fire frequency difference index (AFDI) to characterize the spatial patterns of Siberian wildfires. This index has a correlation coefficient of 0.45 with PC1 of TP precipitation, which is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The circulation anomalies in response to PC1 can effectively explain this statistical correlation. The zonal dipole pattern in TP precipitation, characterized by positive anomalies in the west, induces a substantial anticyclonic anomaly in the upper troposphere to the northeast of the TP (Fig. 2a). This response can be explained by the steady barotropic vorticity equation for large scales and the circum-global wave train propagation mechanism24,29. The large-scale latent heat anomaly associated with the dipole precipitation pattern extends into the upper troposphere, exciting a stationary Rossby wave response40,41. Further supporting this, simulations of TP heat source forcing using the Linear Baroclinic Model33, along with dynamical diagnostics of Rossby wave sources and wave activity flux propagation (Supplementary Fig. 2), confirm the response of anticyclonic anomalies and the jet stream to TP precipitation forcing. This anticyclonic anomaly results in stronger westerlies to its north, causing the East Asian subtropical westerly jet stream to shift further north compared to its usual climatological position (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3), with a correlation coefficient of 0.46 between PC1 and the northern edge of the jet stream (JSNE). Here, we analyzed several key characteristics of the East Asian subtropical jet stream, including its intensity, width, displacement, and northern edge, and examined their relationships with PC1 of TP precipitation (Fig. 2b\u2013e). The leading mode of TP precipitation exhibited an insignificant relationship with the intensity of the jet stream but showed a close association with the position of the jet stream, particularly the latitude of JSNE. Therefore, the subtropical East Asian jet stream may be a crucial link between mid-summer TP precipitation and Siberian wildfires.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Circulation anomalies related to Tibetan Plateau (TP) precipitation and relationships between the East Asia jet stream and Arctic wildfires.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Linear regression of mid-summer horizontal winds (vectors, unit: m s\u22121) and geopotential height (shading, unit: gpm) at 200 hPa onto the first principal component (PC1) of TP precipitation.

This cyclonic anomaly leads to a decrease in surface air temperature (Supplementary Fig. 4a) by increasing cloud cover and reducing solar radiation in the affected region (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c), resulting in a lower fire weather index (FWI) in ESB (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the southerly wind anomalies to the east of the cyclonic anomaly enhance precipitation in ESB, suppressing fire activity from the perspectives of both initial spread and buildup conditions (van Wagner, 1987). Together, these factors contribute to the suppression of wildfires in ESB. Conversely, the reduced cloud cover and increased solar radiation in CSB lead to decreased precipitation, creating more favorable conditions for wildfire occurrences. The meridional circulation formed between the northeastern TP and CSB further promotes the occurrence of wildfires in CSB through an enhanced adiabatic sinking motion, while the anomalous updraft in ESB increases the potential for precipitation (Supplementary Fig. 5). Our quantitative results showed that the FWI in CSB during years with high PC1 values increased by ~27.1%, while in ESB, it decreased by approximately 14.0% compared with years having normal PC1 values (see Supplementary Table 1); this was driven changes in surface temperature, cloud cover, and precipitation. Such FWI anomalies led to a 59.9% increase in annual average wildfire frequency in the CSB compared with years having normal PC1 values, while the wildfire frequency in ESB has experienced a 64.9% decrease. Sensitivity experiments based on CAM5.3 further validated the crucial role of the subtropical jet stream in linking TP precipitation patterns with Arctic wildfires (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 6). The position of the JSNE exhibited a strong northward movement response to the latent heat released by observed TP precipitation when comparing the sensitivity experiments (~45.2\u00b0N) with the control experiments (~42.7\u00b0N). Consequently, there was a substantial difference in precipitation and cloud cover between CSB and ESB (Fig. 4b, d). The sensitivity simulations revealed a slightly higher difference in Tas between CSB and ESB compared with the control experiments (Fig. 4c), but this difference was &lt;0.5 standard deviations. The FWI derived from the simulation data also exhibits a significant response to TP precipitation anomalies (Fig. 4e). Compared to the control experiment, the sensitivity experiment shows a notable increase in the difference in FWI between the CSB and ESB regions, supporting the mechanism proposed in the observational analysis. These simulation results were highly consistent with observational data in terms of both key metrics (Fig. 5) and spatial distribution (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). These numerical simulation results verify the physical mechanism of the response of Siberian wildfire weather conditions to TP precipitation proposed based on observational analysis.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire weather conditions related to the East Asia jet stream.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a\u2012d</emphasis> Linear regression of mid-summer jet stream northern edge (JSNE) index onto <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> vorticity (unit: 10\u22125 s\u22121), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> total layer water vapor flux (vectors, unit: kg m\u22121 s\u22121) and its divergence (shading, unit: 10\u22125 kg m\u22122 s-1), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> fire weather index (FWI), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> precipitation (unit: mm).

The triangle (circular) marks indicate the multi-year average (annual average) of the variable within each year group.</p><p>The robust causal relationship between TP precipitation and Siberian wildfire patterns enhances our confidence in estimating related carbon emissions (Fig. 5). Owing to the limited temporal coverage of the emission dataset, we used 0.5 times the standard deviation of the normalized PC1 of TP precipitation as a threshold to categorize the 19 years from 2002 to 2022 into three groups: five high PC1 years (PC1 &gt; 0.5: 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019), seven low PC1 years (PC1 &lt; \u22120.5: 2002, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015, and 2017), and seven normal PC1 years (0.5 &gt; PC1 &gt; \u22120.5: 2003, 2005, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, and 2020). In high PC1 years, the burned area (14.9 million km2) and emissions (C: 42.5 million tons; CO2: 139.1 million tons; CH4: 441.8 thousand tons) in the CSB region were substantially higher than those in other years (Fig. 5a). The burned area and carbon-related emissions were 3.8 and 5.8 times higher, respectively, compared with those in low PC1 years. This quantity of CO2 emissions was equivalent to the total anthropogenic and natural CO2 emissions of the five Nordic countries combined in 2020 (Crippa et al.42). In normal PC1 years, the burned area and carbon-related emissions generally fell between the values recorded in high PC1 and low PC1 years. Similarly, the burned area and carbon-related emissions in ESB across the three groups of years were also analyzed (Fig. 5b). In high PC1 years, the burned area and carbon-related emissions in ESB decreased compared to other years, although the differences were much smaller than those observed in CSB across the three groups of years. Overall, in high PC1 years, the total burned area from wildfires across Siberia was 5.3 million km2 greater than that in low PC1 years, and CO2 emissions were 89.9 million tons higher, the latter being equivalent to 2.7 times the total CO2 emissions of Sweden in 202043. From the spatial distribution results, we found that the impact of TP precipitation on wildfires in CSB was much greater than its impact on wildfires in ESB (Supplementary Fig. 8). In summary, our results highlight the substantial contribution of interannual climate variability to global carbon emissions and emphasize the need to carefully account for the impact of non-local climate signals when assessing Arctic wildfire risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>The Arctic was warming at a rate far exceeding the global average, leading to a marked increase in extreme weather events, particularly wildfires. These fires not only release large amounts of greenhouse gases directly through forest combustion but also increase the risk of carbon release from permafrost and tundra2,4,9.</p><p>Our analysis reveals that, beyond local meteorological conditions, climate signals from mid-low latitudes could also be strongly linked to Arctic wildfires. A mid-summer precipitation dipole anomaly over the TP was strongly associated with increased wildfire activity in CSB and decreased activity in ESB (Fig. 6). Evidence for this relationship comes from both observational analyses and numerical simulations. Our study also highlighted the important contribution of this connection to the annual variability in carbon emissions from Arctic wildfires. Given the predictability of summer precipitation over the TP31, it may serve as a potentially effective indicator of Siberian wildfires.Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Physical mechanisms of the mid-summer dipole TP precipitation pattern affecting the wildfires in Siberia.</emphasis></p><p>The large-scale latent heating released by the mid-summer dipole pattern in TP precipitation triggers anticyclonic anomalies in the upper-level troposphere to the northeast of the TP, leading to a northward shift of the subtropical jet stream. The vorticity forcing on the northern flank of the jet induces cyclonic anomalies, creating atmospheric conditions favorable for wildfires in Central Siberia (CSB), while suppressing wildfire occurrence in Eastern Siberia (ESB). The results were derived from composing the differences between cases with high and low PC1 of TP precipitation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that wildfires were influenced by both current climate conditions and pre-fire-season factors such as soil moisture, snowmelt, and vegetation cover23,44,45. Therefore, the combined effects of these pre-existing conditions and TP precipitation require further investigation. Additionally, although TP precipitation was closely related to the East Asian subtropical jet stream, the interaction between TP precipitation and the jet stream was complex and cannot be simply characterized as one-way31,35). As a key component of internal atmospheric variability, changes in the jet stream itself may simultaneously impact precipitation over the TP and boreal wildfires. Therefore, a large number of ensemble simulations will need to be performed in the future to quantify the relative contribution of TP precipitation further.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data</emphasis></p><p>The observed active fire data were derived from the Fire Information for Resource Management System; this distributes near real-time active fire data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite aboard S-NPP, NOAA 20, and NOAA 21. The original data records the location (in latitude and longitude coordinates) and date of each active fire. To facilitate spatiotemporal analysis from a climatic perspective, we counted the frequency of daily active fires with a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0. Therefore, the daily AFF is measured as the frequency of fires (number of ignition points) occurring within each grid cell per day. This method can, to some extent, reflect the fire area and intensity within the grid cell.</p><p>The GPCC and CRU precipitation data were available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Physical Sciences Laboratory and the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis Archive, respectively.</p><p>The ERA5 reanalysis products were available from the Climate Data Store. The dataset contains geopotential heights (Z), zonal and meridional winds (U and V), relative humidity at different levels, and surface air temperature (Tas). The FWI used in this study is based on the Canadian FWI system46, which has been widely recognized and applied in global fire weather research. The FWI can be calculated using ERA-5 reanalysis (including daily total precipitation, surface air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity), incorporating both the initial spread index and the build-up index; this provides a numerical rating of potential frontal fire intensity46. The calculation of observed and simulated FWI can be implemented through the following code storage (<url normalizedValue=\"https://github.com/steidani/FireDanger\">https://github.com/steidani/FireDanger</url>).</p><p>The fifth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED5) was also used to determine wildfire emissions caused by Tibetan Plateau (TP) precipitation anomalies. The monthly gridded estimates of burned area and emissions including C, CO2, and CH4, from 2002 to 2022 with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0.</p><p>Due to data limitations, the results related to wildfire emissions are based on 2002\u20132022, while all other results are based on 2001\u20132023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leading mode of TP precipitation and East Asian jet stream index</emphasis></p><p>In this study, \u201cTP precipitation\u201d refers to precipitation within the broader extent of the TP, consistent with the commonly used definition in previous studies. The leading mode of mid-summer (July\u2012August) TP precipitation was obtained via EOF analysis. The results of the EOF analysis were not sensitive to the choice of domain35.</p><p>A jet stream was traditionally defined as a high-speed wind belt in the upper troposphere with wind speeds &gt;30 m s\u22121. However, owing to the relatively lower intensity of jet streams in summer, a threshold of 25 m s\u22121 was commonly used for detection47,48.</p><p>Previous studies have typically used the regional average wind speed in a fixed region to describe the intensity or other features of jet streams, while some have employed EOF to capture the intensity and displacement variations of jet streams49,50. However, both approaches have limitations: the former fails to adequately describe jet stream characteristics in years with substantial shifts in jet stream position, while the latter was overly dependent on the available dataset. To address these limitations, we here used self-adaptive jet stream indices to describe the key characteristics of the East Asia jet stream51. These indices include key features such as intensity, displacement, and width, where the width was calculated as the difference between the northern and southern edges of the jet stream.</p><p>To identify the northern (JSNE) and southern edges of the jet stream at each longitude in 70\u2012 130\u00b0E, the average latitude at point  was defined as the south (north) edge if the wind speed  \u2265 25 m s\u22121 (&lt;25 m s\u22121) and &lt; 25 m s\u22121 (\u226525 m s\u22121). The meridional displacement of the jet stream was defined as the average latitude of the points corresponding to the maximum wind speed along each longitude line from 70\u00b0E to 130\u00b0E. The jet stream intensity was calculated from the average wind speed between its northern and southern edges. The horizontal jet stream core was identified as a grid point where the wind speed was &gt;25 m s\u22121 and greater than the surrounding eight grid points.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Numerical simulations</emphasis></p><p>Control and sensitivity experiments based on the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3) were conducted to verify the physical mechanism by which mid-summer TP precipitation affects Siberian wildfire patterns. CAM5.3 is the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2 and was widely used to verify the response of the atmosphere to heat source variations on the TP18,52,53. We use the finite-volume dynamic core configured with a horizontal resolution of 1.9\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 longitude (f19_g16 scheme) and 30 vertical hybrid levels. For more details of this model, see the official tutorial54.</p><p>Following the experimental scheme designed by previous studies53,55, we first performed a series of control experiments (global sea ice and sea surface temperature are maintained at the climatological levels of 1979\u20132023 interpolated from Hadley Centre HadISST dataset to match the model resolution; emissions and radiation levels are fixed at the levels of the year 2000) under the default settings to derive different initial fields. The model was spun up for 5 years and then integrated forward for 20 years. Simulations of the 1st January of the last 20 years were used as the initial field for sensitivity ensemble simulation, and the sensitivity experiments with 20 members were integrated from the beginning of January to the end of August. A 20-member sensitivity ensemble experiment was sufficiently robust and reliable to eliminate uncertainties brought about by differences in the initial conditions56. In mid-summer, latent heat released from precipitation was the dominant contributor to the total diabatic heating over the TP (Duan and Wu, 2005), which can be calculated as follows:1where  is the specific heat capacity at a constant pressure of dry air,  denotes the air temperature,  represents vertical velocity,  is the static stability, and  is the horizontal wind. Therefore, we simulated the effects of precipitation variations by modifying the 3-dimensional  profile within the model. In the sensitivity simulations, a value of 1.5 times the observed July\u2012August  anomaly in the TP region (22\u201342\u00b0N, 65\u2013105\u00b0E) in the abnormal TP precipitation years (2006, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022; selected based on a threshold of 0.5 times the standard deviation) between 2001 and 2023 was added to the model. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the Q1 difference between the sensitivity experiment and the control experiment is consistent with that in Supplementary Fig. 9c, with the values amplified by a factor of 1.5. The purpose of magnifying anomalies is to highlight the results driven by specified forcings. The total atmospheric apparent heat source during high PC1 years, and normal years, as well as their differences, were displayed in Supplementary Fig. 8. The only difference between the sensitivity simulations and the control simulations lies in the non-adiabatic heating profile over the key region of the TP precipitation. Therefore, the ensemble difference between the sensitivity and control experiments was taken as the simulation result, which indicates the atmospheric circulation response to the identified precipitation pattern.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This research is supported by Tsinghua University (100008001), Swedish Research Council (2021-02163 and 2022-06011), and the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT: CH2020-8767).

According to news originating from Hubei, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The application of triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generators (TEHGs) for wind energy harvesting has become a focal area of research. Such systems typically lack the ability to dynamically allocate power based on the optimal operating conditions of the TENG and EMG, limiting overall efficiency and performance.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Beijing Natural Science Foundation, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), National Key R &amp; D Project from Minister of Science and Technology, High-Performance Computing Center of Wuhan University of Science and Technology. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Wuhan University, \"This study proposes a bionic-blade speed matched triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator (BSM-TEHG) to address this challenge. The BSM-TEHG uses a wind-speed matching mechanism to optimize the performance of different power generation units, while the bionic blade, inspired by humpback whale fins, enhances wind energy capture. The bionic blade increased output power by 210 % compared to a conventional turbine, as demonstrated through computational fluid dynamics analysis and experimental optimization. Electrical output of TENG and EMG were tested across varying speeds, and a dynamic coupling unit optimally matched each mode to specific wind speeds, maximizing energy conversion. The BSM-TEHG achieved peak power increases of 510 % and 480 % compared to TENG-only and EMG-only modes, respectively, with a power density of 37.26 W m- 3 at 10 m s-1.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, the BSM-TEHG successfully powered multiple sensors, establishing a self-powered forest fire warning system, providing an efficient solution for wind energy conversion and a foundation for smart forestry applications.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Enhanced Wind Energy Harvesting Performance of Triboelectric-electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Via Whale Fin Blades and Speed Matching.

According to news originating from Lanzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires present a significant challenge to ecosystems, particularly due to factors like tree cover that complicate fire detection tasks.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese National College Students Innovation And Entrepreneurship Training Program. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Lanzhou University of Technology: \"While fire detection technologies, like YOLO, are widely used in forest protection, capturing diverse and complex flame features remains challenging. Therefore, we propose an enhanced YOLOv8 multiscale forest fire detection method. This involves adjusting the network structure and integrating Deformable Convolution and SCConv modules to better adapt to forest fire complexities. Additionally, we introduce the Coordinate Attention mechanism in the Detection module to more effectively capture feature information and enhance model accuracy. We adopt the WIoU v3 loss function and implement a dynamically non-monotonic mechanism to optimize gradient allocation strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a mAP of 90.02%, approximately 5.9% higher than the baseline YOLOv8 network.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This method significantly improves forest fire detection accuracy, reduces False Positive rates, and demonstrates excellent applicability in real forest fire scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Precision-Boosted Forest Fire Target Detection via Enhanced YOLOv8 Model.

According to news originating from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fire is a very common natural or human-made disaster, which not only burns precious forest resources, but also further alters the forest ecosystem structure and functions as well as global climate. Accordingly, effective information extraction, data management, and modeling of historical fire events are imperative for forecasting and mitigating the onset and progression of forest fires.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Ministry of Science And Technology of The People's Republic of China; Foundation For Innovative Research Groups of The National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"Traditional remote sensing-based forest fire detection and risk prediction operate at the pixel scale, overlooking the integrity of fire behaviour. Moreover, fire cause records typically stem from ground reports, not fully leveraging the advantages of high temporal resolution thermal infrared remote sensing products. We proposed a framework to identify the causes of forest fire events, experimenting with fire incidents from 2001 to 2020 in the Daxing'anling region of Northeast China. Initially, the Jenk-DBSCAN model was employed to acquire fire footprints representative of forest fire events from MODIS MCD64A1 product, and footprint-based fire event attribute information such as ignition locations and timings. Fire footprints matching ground surveys were subsequently filtered, and corresponding environmental variable datasets (including meteorological, topographical, fuel, and human activity factors) were derived in consideration of the spatio-temporal differences of footprint origin and center points. Finally, the optimal variable combinations of the two datasets were fed to three binary classification models including Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) respectively to identify natural fires or human-induced fires, followed by assessing the accuracy of the fire cause identification models. Results revealed that there was a high spatio-temporal consistency of those matched fire footprints between the model-extracted and the ground-recorded fire events, evidenced by an overall R2 of 0.87 derived from their area validation. The ignition dates extracted from fire footprints often preceded those reported by local agencies. Among all the selected variable combinations for fire cause identification, the meteorological variables dominated, with daily mean dew point (DEWP) and daily mean visibility (VISIB) being preferentially selected by most models. Across the six models, the model training AUC values were almost greater than 0.8, with the LR model demonstrating superior validation accuracy over RF and SVM. Notably, the accuracy of the LR model using the origin point based dataset surpassed that of the center point-based dataset. The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 90.48%, with the user's accuracies for human-made fire and natural fire being at 92.86% and 85.71%, respectively.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The proposed framework offers a reliable method for enriching attribute information in forest fire management databases. The resulting fire footprints and origin points can assist in better characterizing the progression of forest fire events. Such endeavours help devise targeted forest fire prevention regulations, fostering sustainable forest management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A novel framework for identifying causes of forest fire events using environmental and temporal characteristics of the ignition point in fire footprint.

Wood and charcoal fires are prohibited, as are kerosene and gas torches. The ban is in place for all 564 municipalities.</p><p>That means campers at the state's parks must do without fires.</p><p>Current conditions?</p><p>Officials say the next few days are of extra concern because winds are expected to gust 20 mph or more with very low humidity. No rain is in the forecast for at least the next week, and most days are expected to be sunny.</p><p>\"When conditions become this dry, the simplest things can start a wildfire,\" said Bill Donnelly, chief of the state Forest Fire Service. \"In my 30-year career with the Forest Fire Service, I can't recall a time when we faced such a prolonged period of dry weather with no relief in sight.\"</p><p>Larry Hajna, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that the current fire restrictions \"are not common.\"</p><p>John Cecil, assistant commissioner for State Parks, Forests &amp; Historic Sites, said that similar weather conditions in the late 1800s prompted the state to create the Forest Fire Service.</p><p>Gov. Phil Murphy declared a statewide drought watch last week and urged residents and businesses to voluntarily conserve water. The goal of the watch is make the public aware of the dry conditions and that water levels in streams, reservoirs, and groundwater are low. Groundwater is found underground in aquifers, which are cracks in spaces of soil, sand, and rock that collect and store water. If conditions don't improve, the state could declare a drought warning or drought emergency, possibly leading to mandatory restrictions.</p><p>Southern New Jersey has fared worse than the rest of the state. Many areas are running 6.4 to 7.6 inches below normal for rainfall over the past 90 days.</p><p>The drought index, used by the state Forest Fire Service, is at 725, which is near the top level of 800. The index, which gauges forest fire potential, takes into account the dryness of soil, as well as that of leaves, pine needles, branches, and twigs on the forest floor. State officials said in a statement that the current level is \"near top level drought conditions and a condition rarely observed over decades of observations.\"</p><p>They are asking people not to toss cigarettes, matches, or smoking materials on the ground and to use indoor wood stoves and fireplaces carefully.</p><p>How about Pa.?</p><p>So far, Pennsylvania officials have not made any drought declarations nor related restrictions. However, the U.S. Drought Monitor map, produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture, shows much of the southeastern part of the state is experiencing severe drought conditions.</p><p>The state's Department of Environmental Protection uses various indicators including stream flow, groundwater level, precipitation, and soil moisture. The DEP would make a drought declaration only after monitoring departures from normal ranges over a period of 3 to 12 months. It also considers information from public water suppliers.</p><p>Regardless of any declaration, the National Weather Service issued a statement that there is an increased risk of fire for the region, including Philadelphia, given the low humidity and wind gusts.</p><p>\"These conditions will support the spread of any fires that ignite, which could quickly become difficult to control,\" the statement said. \"Outdoor burning is strongly discouraged.\"</p><p>Keeping an eye on the salt line</p><p>Kate Schmidt, a spokesperson for the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), a multistate agency that manages water use in the Delaware River, said officials are watching conditions closely.</p><p>The DRBC said it is unusually dry throughout the Delaware River Basin. One of its goals during drought conditions is to ensure there is enough water in reservoirs to repel salt water from creeping up the Delaware River Estuary to Philadelphia, which draws its drinking water from the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. Drinking water intakes on the Delaware River are 10 miles upstream of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.</p><p>As of Thursday, storage was 47.3 billion gallons above drought watch, and releases from upper reservoirs near New York have been made to keep water flowing.</p><p>But Schmidt said no releases have yet been needed from the Blue Marsh and Beltzville reservoirs, which are located in the Schuylkill and Lehigh River watershed.</p><p>Freshwater releases, if needed, keep salty or brackish water from advancing up from the Delaware Bay during low-flow conditions and reaching drinking water intakes in Philadelphia and New Jersey. The salt line is currently threemiles above Chester, which is roughly 16 miles upstream from its normal location for this time of year, but not unusual under similar dry conditions.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fkummer@inquirer.com\">fkummer@inquirer.com</email></p><p>FrankKummer</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8C-K6W1-DYJT-24FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 25, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Gunmen <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/asia/gunmen-open-fire-jammu-kashmir-intl/index.html\">killed at least 26 people</url> and injured a dozen others in the popular tourist destination of Pahalgam, which is located in the mountainous Anantnag district. It was one of the region's worst assaults on civilians in years. A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack, but it did not provide evidence and CNN could not independently verify its claim. By Tuesday night, tourists were scrambling to leave the region, prompting airlines to add extra flights. Outraged residents also took to the streets to protest the shooting and call for an end to terrorism.</p><p>3. State Department</p><p>A<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/politics/rubio-state-department-cuts/index.html\"> reorganization of the State Department</url> will eliminate 132 domestic offices and cut around 700 federal workers. Secretary of State Marco Rubio rolled out the first stage of the effort Tuesday, according to a senior State Department official and documents obtained by CNN. The agency says the changes are necessary to maintain its efficacy and relevance, with a senior official calling the current department organization chart \"bloated.\" The changes are in addition to the Trump administration's efforts to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/state-department-formally-notifies-congress-effectively-dissolving-usaid/index.html\"> dissolve the US Agency for International Development</url>. USAID, which has historically functioned as an independent unit with oversight from Congress and the State Department, fought poverty and hunger around the world until Rubio was appointed its new administrator. Now, nearly all foreign aid has been frozen, thousands of USAID employees are out of work and billions of dollars in contracts have been canceled. Fewer than 900 USAID employees remain on staff.</p><p>4. Economy</p><p>The International Monetary Fund <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/economy/imf-us-global-economies-tariffs-intl/index.html\">issued a stark warning</url> about President Trump's unpredictable tariff policy and countermeasures by American trading partners: If the situation persists, US prosperity will suffer - and so will the global economy. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF forecast that global economic growth will slow to 2.8% in 2025, down from 3.3% last year and significantly below the historical average. The US economy is only expected to grow 1.8% this year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The IMF isn't the only one <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/22/investing/dow-great-depression-sell-america-trade/index.html\">sounding alarm bells</url>. US financial markets are also revealing how the escalating trade war is making America an unsafe place to invest. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 9.1% in the first three weeks of April, the index's worst performance for any April since 1932.</p><p>5. Fertility rate</p><p>As the US fertility rate hovers near a record low, the Trump administration is keen for more women to have babies. A report from the CDC showed that about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/fertility-rate-cdc-report-trump-pronatalism/index.html\">3.6 million babies were born in the US</url> last year. The fertility rate was highest among women in their early 30s while teen births and births among women in their early 20s declined to new lows. Many factors could be contributing to the decision not to have a child, including socioeconomic circumstances, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/maternal-deaths-high-income-nations/index.html\">maternal health care crisis</url>, less access to family planning services, climate change concerns and a shaky economy. Although Trump has called for \"a baby boom\" and described himself as the \"father of IVF,\" federal programs focused on reproductive health also have taken a heavy hit from the Department of Government Efficiency. Programs focused on abortion surveillance, contraception guidelines, IVF surveillance and pregnancy risk assessment were particularly affected by these changes.</p><p>THIS JUST IN</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Earthquake strikes off coast of Istanbul, Turkish officials say</emphasis>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/europe/istanbul-turkey-earthquake-intl/index.html\">6.2-magnitude earthquake</url> struck off the coast of Istanbul this morning, according to Turkey's Crisis and Natural Disaster Management services AFAD.

New Jersey has not received measurable rain in over a month, setting a new record, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>The latest blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire, broke out Saturday in West Milford, sending smoke toward Bergen County and Manhattan. By mid-afternoon, it had already ripped across 1,800 acres and was 0% contained, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service.</p><p>On Friday afternoon, the Pompton Lakes Fire broke out on the property of the old DuPont factory, once a chemical worksite, on Cannonball Road, just off Route 28.</p><p>As of Saturday afternoon, that blaze had burned through 164 acres of land and was 50% contained. While no evacuation orders had been issued, the Forest Fire Service said the flames posed a risk to 55 nearby structures.</p><p>Earlier on Friday, a separate fire broke out in Englewood Cliffs near Exit 1 on the Palisades Parkway, about a mile north of the George Washington Bridge.

Leveraging Earth observation data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and machine learning-based analysis enables a broader range of trend analyses. Key results include a 4% increase in urban areas, a 1.1% rise in forest coverage, and a 3.1% decrease in cropland. Population trends show a 7.44% growth in urban regions and a 1.22% decline in rural areas, while SDG indices reveal a 10.56% increase in the Urban Green Space Index in some areas. The innovative Ecological Characteristic Map (ECM) provides significant insights, highlighting the variability in ecological conditions and the need for region-specific conservation strategies. This work contributes to the discourse on sustainable development in the Korean Peninsula, fostering collaboration while laying the groundwork for peace-building initiatives and science diplomacy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The contemporary discourse on global environmental issues is increasingly centered around the urgent challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity erosion, and the imperative for effective ecological stewardship1. In this context, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play a pivotal role, highlighting the necessity for sustainable environmental practices and the importance of global cooperative alliances in ecological governance. This is particularly relevant in geopolitically complex regions like the Korean Peninsula, where collaborative efforts are essential for fostering peace, sustainability, and resilience against ecological challenges2, 3\u20134.</p><p>The Korean Peninsula, a region of significant geological and ecological importance, presents unique challenges and opportunities for ecological management due to its diverse terrains and ecosystems. This complexity necessitates a nuanced understanding of ecological dynamics, particularly the impacts of developmental pressures on biodiversity conservation and sustainable practices5, 6, 7\u20138. Historically, research in this area has primarily focused on localized studies with limited temporal scope, often neglecting the interplay between ecological changes and broader socio-economic factors5,9,10. This oversight is typically attributed to constraints in conducting comprehensive field surveys, further exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions. Consequently, various ecological and biodiversity sources such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) are not available in the region11.</p><p>Over the last two decades, advancements in remote sensing technology, coupled with cloud-based platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), have shown high potential to overcome traditional survey limitations by offering reliable fine spatial and temporal resolutions. The GEE platform provides not only various sensor data but also extensive environmental datasets derived from those sensors, including rainfall, topographic details, detailed land cover classifications, and population. These data can contribute to a deep understanding of the interplay between natural ecosystems and human-induced modifications12, 13, 14\u201315. Despite its high potential for utilization, current research methods leveraging GEE have rarely been utilized for comprehensive analyses across the entire Korean Peninsula, where ecological and administrative complexities intersect16,17.</p><p>This research aims to conduct an in-depth trend analysis over the past two decades across the Korean Peninsula using an earth observation dataset on the GEE platform. The study specifically examines land cover changes and explores ecological dynamics tailored to each province on the Korean Peninsula, incorporating SDGs indices, demographic trends, and an ecological characteristic map framework18. The research questions this study addresses are: (1) How have land cover and ecological characteristics evolved over the last twenty years across different provinces of the Korean Peninsula? (2) What are the primary drivers of these changes, and how do they relate to SDG indices and population dynamics? (3) Which regions require urgent ecological management to balance conservation with development needs?</p><p>This approach is in line with current discussions emphasizing the need for an integrated and strategic approach to address ecological and sustainability challenges, as highlighted by studies on nexus approaches to global sustainable development19. The anticipated outcomes of this research will identify provinces or regions requiring intensified ecological management efforts, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamic balance between development and ecological conservation, and emphasizing the necessity for tailored management strategies in response to the peninsula\u2019s diverse ecological characteristics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p>This study offers an in-depth examination of the ecological dynamics of the Korean Peninsula over the last twenty years, with a particular focus on the changes in land cover and ecological diversity. The primary analysis was conducted on the GEE platform, a powerful tool for handling large-scale geographical data and environmental datasets. Figure 1illustrates the study area with the spatial distribution of key ecological variables: provincial mean annual precipitation of twenty years, ranging from 845 mm/year (yellowish) to 1846 mm/year (bluish); biodiversity scores, spanning a spectrum from 0 (greenish) to 2.8 (reddish)18; and land classifications from the WorldCover202120. These variables are essential for understanding the ecological framework of the Korean Peninsula, which is characterized by distinct four seasons and substantial rainfall during the summer. This climatic pattern influences the diverse ecological zones depicted in the land use and affects the biodiversity, reflecting the complex interplay of natural and human-induced factors across the peninsula.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Spatial Distribution of Ecological Variables and Land Cover Across the Korean Peninsula: Provincial Mean Annual Precipitation depicted (left), biodiversity (middle), and WorldCover2021 with legends of each class (right). Map created using QGIS 3.28 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org\">https://qgis.org</url>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land Cover trend analysis</emphasis></p><p>The Moderate Resolution (500-meter) Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Climate Modeling Grid (MCD12Q1) product and the high-resolution (10-meter) WorldCover 2021 product are primarily used for land cover trend analysis. MCD12Q1 provides multi-temporal land classification maps from 2001 to 2021 annually, including water bodies, urban/built-up areas, forests, croplands, and herbaceous zones. Observations were specifically made for the years 2001, 2011, and 2021 to assess land cover changes across two decades within provinces. The \u2018LC_Prop2\u2019 band in MCD12Q1 was analyzed to provide detailed land cover types. Although MCD12Q1 is instrumental in revealing broad ecological trends over time, its spatial resolution presents some limitations in revealing the details of land cover21. This analysis is further refined and complemented by the high-resolution WorldCover 2021, which provides a more detailed depiction of the landscape, including land cover classes such as Tree cover, Shrubland, Grassland, Cropland, Built-up areas, Bare/Sparse vegetation, Permanent water bodies, and Herbaceous wetland22. However, WorldCover products have only been available since 2020, introducing a temporal limitation. Both MCD12Q1 and WorldCover represent a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, making their complementary use beneficial. The function of \u2018pixelCountDict\u2019 on GEE was used to assess the frequency of each land cover type, enabling quantitative analysis of land cover changes over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sustainable development goal (SDG) index analysis</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Alongside the analysis of bi-decadal land cover changes across provinces, key Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indices and their bi-decadal changes are also examined. These indices include the Urban Green Space Index (UGSI), Agricultural Sustainability Index (ASI), Water Resource Sustainability Index (WRSI), Biodiversity Protection Index (BPI), and Climate Resilience Index (CRI)23,24. These metrics are integral to evaluating the effectiveness of ecological management and provide insights into the ecological and socio-economic trends of the Korean Peninsula, thereby guiding the development of strategies for managing ecological trends and challenges. The five key SDG indices were calculated utilizing data from MCD12Q1 and WorldCover, applying equations based on international sustainability standards23, 24\u201325:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Demographic data integration</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Incorporating population dynamics from WorldPop26allows for exploring the interplay between demographic changes and the performance of SDG indices in each province, a vital factor in understanding societal influences on ecological sustainability and developing tailored management strategies that support both human well-being and environmental integrity. This integration of human population data from the WorldPop project is used to analyze its impact on ecological variables across the Korean Peninsula26. WorldPop specializes in high-resolution, contemporary data on global population distributions, crucial for assessing the effects of population growth and demographic shifts. The analysis strategy correlates population density, growth patterns, and urbanization trends with changes in land cover and biodiversity.</p><p>For the years 2001, 2011, and 2020, WorldPop datasets were utilized, providing estimated population numbers in each grid cell. This comprehensive population data enabled an analysis of demographic changes and their ecological implications over two decades, offering valuable insights into the complex interactions between human and natural systems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Development of the ecological characteristic/mixture map</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The Ecological Characteristic/Mixture Map (ECM) has been developed based on machine-learning-based unsupervised clustering by integrating mean annual precipitation (MAP) data, the vegetation cover such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and biodiversity data18. The unsupervised clustering method enables grouping data into clusters based on their similarities without predefined labels. This process identifies distinct ecological regions with unique environmental attributes. Consequently, it effectively captures the intricate ecological states across different regions, identifying key areas and regions needing conservation. This integration method aims to provide a holistic view of the ecological state of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>For this study, twenty years of accumulated rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) dataset on GEE were used, providing a long-term perspective on precipitation trends and detailed insights into rainfall distribution and variation. For vegetation cover information, the NDVI derived from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data with a 10-meter spatial resolution was employed to offer a detailed analysis of vegetation cover. Biodiversity was estimated using a pre-trained model by Chang (2023)18, which was designed for climatic gradient zones and utilized various environmental factors. Initially, twelve clusters were used to generate the ECM across the Korean Peninsula to investigate ecological dynamics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trend analysis across provinces from 2001 to 2021</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The analysis of the past two decades reveals significant shifts in land cover across Korean provinces, as detailed in Fig. 2. Across the Korean Peninsula, water bodies have consistently represented 1.2% of the landscape, indicating ecological stability in aquatic regions. Urban areas have seen a modest increase from 3.5 to 3.7%, reflecting the gradual expansion of cities. Forest coverage has also experienced a slight increase from 63.5 to 64.6%, suggesting positive trends in forest conservation or natural regrowth. Notably, intermediate data for 2011 shows forest coverage briefly dipped to 63.0%, highlighting dynamic fluctuations in conservation efforts. In contrast, cropland has decreased from 27.2 to 24.1%, with 2011 indicating an intermediate level of 25.6%, which could be attributed to urban expansion or shifts in agricultural practices. Additionally, the area of herbaceous land cover has expanded from 4.6 to 6.4%, with the 2011 data indicating an intermediate increase to 5.5%, potentially signaling shifts in land management or ecological succession. </p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Land Cover Changes Across Korean Provinces from MCD12Q1.

Intermediate data from 2011 illustrates the steady nature of this urban expansion, reflecting either urban densification or effective urban planning strategies. Despite this growth, Seoul, Pusan, and other major cities fall into the \u2018Minimal Change\u2019 category, indicating relative stability in urban development.</p><p>Agricultural Land Shifts: Agricultural-centric provinces such as Kyongsangnam-do have experienced a reduction in cropland area, about 25%, possibly due to land conversion or evolving farming practices, and have been assigned to the \u2018Cropland Reduction\u2019 category. Similarly, Kangwon-do (N) shows a decrease in cropland (from 1.31 to 0.99%) and an increase in herbaceous vegetation (from 0.25 to 0.47%), indicating changing land use patterns. This case is categorized as \u2018Herbaceous Increase\u2019.</p><p>Forestry Cover Fluctuations: Forest-rich areas like Kangwon-do (N) and Hwanghae-namdo show increases in forest coverage, approximately 3% from 0.55 to 0.80%, respectively, suggesting positive environmental trends. These areas are categorized as \u2018Moderate Changes\u2019. Similarly, Kaesong-si also falls into this category, with an increase in forest area from 0.09 to 0.17%.</p><p>Coastal Area Dynamics: Coastal provinces confront the challenge of balancing urban development with marine ecosystem preservation. Despite limited changes under 2%, the data underscores the necessity of protective measures for coastal biodiversity. Cheju-do, characterized under \u2018Minimal Change\u2019, demonstrates stability in its coastal ecosystems.</p><p>Herbaceous Vegetation Stability: Across the provinces, herbaceous vegetation demonstrates minor fluctuations, indicating general ecosystem stability. Chungchongbuk-do shows a decrease in cropland (from 0.84 to 0.65%) and an increase in herbaceous areas (from 0.06 to 0.11%), categorized as \u2018Moderate Changes\u2019.</p><p>Special Cases: Hamgyong-namdo shows a positive trend in forest cover, suggesting effective forest conservation efforts, categorized as \u2018Forest Expansion.\u2019 Conversely, Yanggang-do, located next to Hamgyong-namdo, is experiencing a shift from forest to grassland. This transition might require ecological management to understand the drivers of this change, categorized as \u2018Grassland Increase\u2019.</p><p>Overall, the trends observed over the last twenty years underscore the dynamic nature of land use and ecological conservation on the Korean Peninsula. The data emphasizes the necessity for region-specific ecological management strategies that account for the unique environmental conditions and ecological trends in each province.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Analysis of SDG indices with population across provinces</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>From 2001 to 2021, the Korean Peninsula experienced notable demographic shifts, significantly impacting the progress toward SDGs. This section merges population dynamics with various ecological indices to offer a detailed perspective on each province\u2019s progress and challenges in sustainable development. Initially, to examine the relationship between SDGs and population, high resolution WorldCover land cover map for the 2021 year is utilized to calculate the SDG indices (UGSI, ASI, WRSI, BPI, and CRI) across the provinces of the Korean Peninsula. Figures 4 and 5 show the 2021 SDG indices and population across Provinces of Korean Peninsula, as well as the population change rate over 20 years. Note that there are some differences between WorldPop data and the population data provided by the Republic of Korea, with an average difference of 20.57%. However, WorldCover data was used instead of government data to maintain consistency in the analysis because there is no comprehensive population information available for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. Subsequent sections provide a detailed summary for each province, highlighting the specific impacts and interactions between these variables:</p><p>Kaesong-si, despite experiencing a population growth of approximately 7.44%, has realtively high UGSI and ASI scores in 2021. This suggests a strong commitment to urban greenery and agricultural stability, potentially serving as a model for other regions. In Kangwon-do (N), the UGSI score is high, reflecting a strong presence of urban green spaces. However, the ASI score is low, alongside a slight population decline of about 1.22%, pointing to areas where agricultural practices could be enhanced for greater sustainability. Kyonggi-do, experiencing a significant population increase of 59.89%, presents a unique challenge. Despite its high population growth, it maintains a moderate UGSI of 3.91 and ASI of 0.68. However, the low WRSI of 0.02 and BPI of 0.64, along with a CRI of 0.58, indicate areas where environmental management could be intensified to accommodate this rapid demographic change while aligning with SDGs. Seoul and Busan, as metropolitan areas, have relatively low UGSI scores. Seoul, with a population decline of approximately 4.74%, and Busan, experiencing a 15.27% decrease, both underscore a pressing need for urban ecological enhancements to foster greener cities, aligning with SDG 11. P\u2019yongyang-si shows a different trend, with a 12.24% population decline, despite a higher UGSI score, indicating effective integration of urban green spaces. However, other sustainability indices (BRI, CRI) ecological management. Chagang-do stands out with its high UGSI, indicative of well-integrated green spaces, setting a benchmark for urban ecological planning across the peninsula. The rural provinces of Hamgyong-bukto and Hamgyong-namdo present a contrast, showing modest UGSI scores but low ASI scores, indicating that while there is some presence of urban green spaces, agricultural sustainability is lacking. This scenario highlights the need for targeted interventions to bolster agricultural sustainability, which is crucial for meeting SDG 2 objectives. The analysis also highlights the importance of preserving water resources and biodiversity. The WRSI scores suggest effective water resource management. However, the need for biodiversity conservation and climate resilience is pronounced, particularly in provinces like Kyongsangbuk-do and Kyongsangnam-do, where BPI scores indicate potential for ecological enhancement. Provinces like Cheju-do and Chollabuk-do, showing a harmonious balance of high UGSI and ASI scores, appear well-positioned to achieve SDG targets. In contrast, regions with lower indices, such as Inchon and Taegu, may require focused ecological management interventions to boost sustainable development and better align with the SDG framework.</p><p>These analyses suggest that the diverse ecological and demographic characteristics of the Korean Peninsula\u2019s provinces necessitate tailored strategies for sustainable development and biodiversity conservation, ensuring progress towards the overarching goals of the SDGs.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>SDG indices across provinces of Korean Peninsula, along with the population (M, unit: million) in 2021 year). The indices include Urban Green Space Index (UGSI), Air Quality Satisfaction Index (ASI), Water Resource Stress Index (WRSI), Biodiversity Preservation Index (BPI), and Climate Resilience Index (CRI). Map created using QGIS 3.28.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Population change rate (%) across the province from 2001 to 2021. Map created using QGIS 3.28 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org\">https://qgis.org</url>).</p><p>Next, although the fine-resolution data from WorldCover provided highly accurate SDG indices, its limited temporal coverage restricts the comparison of SDG indices over 20 years. Consequently, multi-year SDG indices derived from the MCD12Q1 dataset were analyzed alongside population change rates to assess their mutual impacts and correlations. The multi-year SDG indices are detailed in Fig. 6, which shows SDG indices across provinces for the years 2001, 2011, and 2021, and Fig. 7, which presents the change rate of SDG indices across provinces between 2001 and 2021.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>SDG Indices Across Provinces from 2001, 2011, and 2021 at a moderate spatial resolution (MCD12Q1).

Several significant relationships emerge between population and various SDG indices for 2021 and over bi-decadal changes. The correlation matrix reveals a strong negative correlation between UGSI and population, at \u2212 0.28 in 2021, intensifying to \u2212 0.45 over the bi-decadal period. This consistent inverse relationship suggests that population increases may lead to decreases in urban green spaces, and vice versa. Similarly, BPI and CRI show a very high positive correlation of 0.91 in 2021, indicating that regions with robust biodiversity preservation tend to also exhibit high climate resilience. This correlation slightly increases to 0.92 over the bi-decadal period. Additionally, WRSI has a positive correlation of 0.23 with population in 2021, suggesting that higher population densities may lead to increased water resource stress. This analysis offers essential insights for policymakers and researchers focused on sustainable development and effective resource management.</p><p>Fig. 8</p><p>Correlation heatmap for population and SDG indices: The upper triangle displays correlations for population and indices in 2021 (as detailed in Fig. 4), while the lower triangle illustrates correlations for the change rate of population and the change rate of SDG indices between 2001 and 2021 (as shown in Figs. 5 and 7). Map generated using Python 3.10 with Seaborn 0.12.2 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://seaborn.pydata.org\">https://seaborn.pydata.org</url>) and Matplotlib 3.7.1 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://matplotlib.org\">https://matplotlib.org</url>).</p><p>Overall, the data (based on Figs. 6 and 8) show a consistent increase in UGSI and CRI across most provinces, indicating an improvement in urban green spaces and cultural resources. However, there are notable variations in ASI and WRSI, which either remained stable or fluctuated slightly over the 20 years. BPI generally increased, reflecting urban expansion.</p><p>Most provinces in 2001 exhibited a stable start with moderate values in UGSI and CRI. ASI values are relatively high, reflecting substantial agricultural areas. By 2011, there is a noticeable increase in UGSI across most provinces, indicating improved urban green spaces. A dip in ASI values in some regions, such as Kangwon-do (N) and P\u2019yongan-namdo, suggests a reduction in agricultural spaces. CRI generally increased, though some provinces like P\u2019yongyang-si saw a decline. In 2021, UGSI continues to increase, with most provinces showing higher values compared to 2001 and 2011. ASI values show a mixed trend; for example, Cheju-do saw a decrease, indicating reduced agricultural areas, while others like Kangwon-do (N) remained stable. BPI and CRI continue to rise, highlighting urban expansion and enhancement of cultural resources.</p><p>Abnormal characteristics in 2011 suggest that this year stood out, with several provinces showing either concave or convex trends. In Kangwon-do (N), the UGSI increased from 59.824 in 2001 to 62.277 in 2011, and then slightly to 64.235 in 2021, showing a convex trend. P\u2019yongan-namdo saw its UGSI decrease from 20.005 in 2001 to 19.553 in 2011, before stabilizing at 19.643 in 2021, indicating a concave trend. Cheju-do\u2019s UGSI remained relatively stable from 2001 to 2011 but dropped significantly in 2021, demonstrating a convex trend. P\u2019yongyang-si exhibited both UGSI and ASI trends, where UGSI increased slightly, while ASI dropped significantly, indicating urbanization at the expense of agricultural areas. These trends reflect regional variations in urbanization, agricultural development, and resource management, highlighting the dynamic nature of land use changes and their impacts on various indices.</p><p>In examining the change rate (as shown in Fig. 7) across various indices, some provinces exhibit significant changes, notably more than 10% or less than \u2212 10%, which are worth highlighting for further discussion and analysis. The UGSI of Hwanghae-bukto showed an increase of 10.56%, and an increase in BPI of 10.56% as well, reflecting significant enhancements in urban green spaces. The ASI of Kangwon-do (N) and P\u2019yongan-namdo experienced substantial decreases of \u2212 16.81% and \u2212 15.48% respectively, indicating a reduction in agricultural areas. The CRI of Hwanghae-namdo and P\u2019yongyang-si showed remarkable changes of 37.75% and \u2212 14.39% respectively, suggesting significant shifts in cultural resources, either through development or possibly a decline in P\u2019yongyang-si\u2019s case. These fluctuations highlight critical regional variations in urbanization, agricultural development, and resource management, reflecting the dynamic nature of land use changes over the two decades and their impacts on these indices.</p><p>To further explore the relationship between population changes and SDG indices, an ordinary least square regression model was applied. The results indicate that the model explains 32.3% of the variance in population changes (R\u00b2 = 0.323). Among the indices, UGSI showed a statistically significant negative relationship with population changes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.030), with a coefficient of \u2212 1.681. The negative association between UGSI and population change could reflect urbanization pressures or a trade-off between green spaces and population growth. Other indices, including ASI, WRSI, BPI, and CRI, did not demonstrate statistically significant relationships with population changes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &gt; 0.05). These results suggest that population change, often regarded as an indicator of development, might have a complex and region-specific relationship with sustainability indices. The findings highlight the need for further investigation into non-linear interactions and regional variations, acknowledging the limitations of the regression model and emphasizing the importance of future analyses to better understand the complex linkages between population dynamics and SDG indicators.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ecological assessment by ECM for cross-province analysis</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The ECM initially identified twelve ecological classes by unsupervised clustering across the Korean Peninsula. However, as shown in Fig. 9, one of these classes, represented in white, indicates areas with negligible vegetation cover, primarily urban or bare surface regions. These areas were rarely changed in ecological analysis due to their minimal ecological activity as determined by abiotic factors. Therefore, the ECM focuses on eleven distinct ecological classes, encapsulating the diverse habitats and environmental conditions of the region. This classification now better showcases the complex ecological mosaic of the peninsula, balancing detailed ecological insight with computational efficiency while acknowledging the critical role of urban environments in regional ecological assessments.</p><p>Class 9, encompassing 2.42% of the land, is distinguished by an exceptional biodiversity index of 2.35 and a MAP of 876 mm/year, making it a reservoir of ecological diversity. The lack of green space data within this class suggests potential areas for further urban ecological studies, particularly to reinforce resilience in densely populated regions. Classes 1 and 4, accounting for 8.39% and 9.16% of the land respectively, exhibit moderate biodiversity indices of 1.13 and 1.35. Their MAP values, at 1058 and 1129 mm/year, point to considerable climatic diversity. They epitomize the delicate interplay between urbanization and agricultural expanses, necessitating integrated strategies that harmonize development with ecological stewardship. Class 11, representing 5.73% of the land, stands out with its biodiversity index of 2.24 and a MAP of 1014 mm/year. This class typifies extensive natural territories, underlining the importance of focused conservation initiatives to preserve biodiversity and ecological integrity. Additionally, Class 3, as the largest class covering 19.53% of the land, has a high biodiversity index of 2.07 and the highest MAP of 1377 mm/year, suggesting it is a key ecological resource with ample water, supporting a broad range of biota. Conversely, Class 7, with only 1.32% land coverage, has the lowest biodiversity index at 0.62 and a MAP of 792 mm/year, indicating regions that might benefit from specific restoration efforts to boost biodiversity. The most expansive Class 10, constituting 23.84% of the land, also records a high biodiversity index of 1.91 and the highest MAP of 1382 mm/year. This class is likely critical for water resource management and biodiversity, emphasizing its significance for targeted ecological strategies.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Ecological Characteristic Map (ECM) with a table of average values of biodiversity, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and percentage of Land Cover for each class. Map generated on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, then finalized using QGIS 3.28 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org\">https://qgis.org</url>) and Microsoft PowerPoint.</p><p>The assessment provided by the ECM is integral for developing nuanced management strategies that not only preserve but also enhance the ecological diversity of the peninsula. By evaluating the unique ecological features of each class, strategic plans can prioritize where conservation and sustainable development efforts are most crucial, ensuring a balance between human activities and natural ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Insights into ecological dynamics on the korean peninsula and beyond</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Our extensive analysis of the ecological dynamics on the Korean Peninsula over the past two decades underscores the intricate relationship between development, conservation, and sustainability. The data reveals a moderate increase in urban areas, paralleling global urban expansion trends, particularly around major cities such as Seoul and Busan. This urbanization, reflected in studies like those by Gorelick et al. (2017) which discuss the impacts of human activities on land cover changes, aligns with our findings that urbanization is closely linked to the expansion of developed ares. Similarly, the unexpected slight increase in forest coverage from 63.5 to 64.6% suggests positive trends in forest conservation or natural regrowth, a deviation from the global trend of forest decline and an insight that resonates with the principles discussed by Liu et al. (2013), emphasizing the importance of context-specific resource management27. Our results also show significant changes in SDG indices across the peninsula. The UGSI and BPI have notably improved in several provinces, suggesting effective local strategies for enhancing urban green spaces and conserving biodiversity. These indices correlate with reduced population densities, illustrating the potential benefits of urban planning that prioritize green spaces and biodiversity, while the ecological benefits of urban green spaces and sustainable agricultural practices play a significant role in food security25. Conversely, the WRSI has shown mixed results, with some areas experiencing lower scores due to increased industrial activities and urban sprawl, highlighting the need for improved water management practices.</p><p>The observed patterns in forest coverage and urban expansion are supported by comparative data from Dong et al. (2020) who investigated spatial-temporal forest changes in the Korean Peninsula, highlighting similar trends of resilience in forest areas despite urban pressures5. This comparison not only validates our methodologies but also enhances the depth of our ecological insights, illustrating the multifaceted impacts of development on conservation efforts. These findings suggest that urban expansion often leads to increased forest management efforts, which may mitigate some of the negative impacts of urban sprawl. Furthermore, the decrease in cropland from 27.2 to 24.1% is indicative of the shifts potentially driven by urban sprawl and changes in agricultural practices, echoed in the work of Pettorelli et al. (2014), who discuss the global impact of urbanization on natural habitats and the need for sustainable land use practices14. The increase in herbaceous land cover, from 4.6 to 6.4%, might signal shifts towards different land management practices or ecological succession, a phenomenon explored by Hansen et al. (2013) in their global review of forest cover changes2.</p><p>The research also aligns with the principles for enhancing ecosystem services resilience28, reflecting a shared understanding of the balance between ecosystem protection and human development. The observed land use changes and ecological pressures on the Korean Peninsula find parallels in Blythe et al.\u2018s (2017) study on transdisciplinary sustainability research, which highlights the critical feedback mechanisms in socio-ecological systems29. This broader perspective reinforces our understanding of the environmental challenges specific to the region. Such insights are crucial as they underscore the dynamic interplay between human activities and natural systems, revealing how policy and management strategies can be optimized for better ecological outcomes.</p><p>The integration of technological advancements, ecological indices, and demographic data in our study provides a broader view of ecological dynamics, central to the global discourse on ecological governance and sustainable development. Our research may contribute to this field, offering insights that are validated and expanded upon by the aforementioned studies. The comparison of our findings with these studies underscores the multifaceted nature of ecological challenges and the importance of cooperative and informed approaches in regions with complex dynamics like the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>The decline in scientific efforts across the Korean Peninsula, largely attributed to political tensions, poses significant challenges to advancing critical areas of research, particularly those aligned with the SDGs and sustainability. Despite these challenges, it remains crucial to sustain research initiatives that can act as catalysts for easing tensions and enhancing diplomatic communications. The concept of \u2018Oikos\u2019\u2014meaning \u201cto live together\u201d\u2014is foundational to the discipline of ecology. It underscores the potential of ecological science to foster a more harmonious coexistence, both within and between societies. By continuing to advance scientific inquiry in ecology and sustainability, there is a significant opportunity not only to enrich our understanding of the natural world but also to facilitate peace and collaboration across geopolitical boundaries. In this context, ecological science also emerges as a powerful tool for science diplomacy, offering pathways to conflict resolution through shared environmental goals and collaborative research projects. Thus, ecological science can play a pivotal role in transforming the landscape of international relations on the Korean Peninsula, promoting a shared commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>This study has provided an extensive analysis of the land cover and ecological changes across the Korean Peninsula, emphasizing significant shifts and their implications for sustainable development. Key findings include a 4% increase in urban areas, a 1.1% increase in forest coverage, a 3.1% decrease in cropland, and notable population changes. The SDG indices and Ecological Characteristic Map (ECM) analysis identified critical areas for targeted ecological management. These findings underscore the necessity for region-specific strategies that balance development and conservation. Ongoing monitoring and adaptive management approaches are essential to address dynamic ecological and socio-economic challenges. Policy interventions must be supported by robust scientific research and stakeholder engagement to ensure sustainability for future generations. This work may enrich sustainable development discourse, with implications for conflict resolution and science diplomacy in the Korean Peninsula.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This study was supported by the SDG initiative of ECOC Israel and ECOC USA, and in part by the Global Partnership of the Northeast Asia Foundation for Education and Culture.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Sunday, J.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Friday, May 30th, 2025. This is The Excerpt. Today, the latest on tariffs after some court moves this week, plus a group of deaf Americans is suing Trump over a lack of sign language interpreters for White House events. We take a closer look at some lurking provisions in the GOP tax bill. </p><p>\u2666</p><p>Tariffs as imposed by President Donald Trump will continue for now. I spoke with USA TODAY White House reporter Zac Anderson about the latest chapter of trade whiplash. Hey there, Zac.</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>Howdy.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right, so starting with this, what did this appeals court decide?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>So the appeals court temporarily put on hold a ruling by a lower court that had blocked Trump from implementing his tariffs. Trump was trying to use a emergency powers law that was enacted in 1977 to implement these tariffs without going through Congress. He had declared a state of emergency, and this trade court had ruled that he couldn't use this law to push his tariffs, which have really been the centerpiece of his economic agenda. The Trump administration immediately appealed that ruling, and less than 24 hours later, the appeals court said, \"We're going to allow you to continue to levy these tariffs while this appeal plays out.\" So really a lot of quick back and forth here, but the tariffs remain in place for now.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Well, this wasn't the only move in court. How else have the courts been intervening over Tariffs Act?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>Two court rulings went against Trump on tariffs this week. One was the ruling that I just mentioned from a trade court. That case had been brought by a number of state officials and also some businesses. Trump's use of the tariffs was deemed invalid in that case. And then there was another lawsuit filed by a pair of toy companies in Illinois that had challenged the tariffs that Trump imposed. A judge also ruled in their favor and invalidated those tariffs, but he paused the impact of that ruling to give the governments two weeks to appeal that decision. So two cases that went against Trump. Both of them have been basically paused while the appeals go forward.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>So how has the Trump White House addressing what has Zac, as you put it, really been trade whiplash?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>The White House has really come out swinging on this. They've gone after these court rulings. This has been a continuation of their efforts to criticize the judiciary, which has blocked a lot of what Trump has done during the first four months of his administration. They called these activist judges and they vowed to appeal all the way up to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/supreme-court/\">Supreme Court</url>, and they said that they're going to continue with their policy here and find a way forward.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>And Zac, I know Trump was asked a question about this TACO acronym earlier this week that some financial analysts are embracing. The acronym stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. What is this and how did Trump respond?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>It was coined by a Wall Street analyst and traders have talked about trading around Trump's tariffs, that basically when he implements the tariffs, the markets crash. But it's only for a short time period, and then they come back up, so that you can basically count on Trump chickening out and plan your trades around that. And that's really taken off in financial circles that Trump was asked about that at the White House the other day, and he really expressed a lot of indignation. Trump likes to be seen as strong and really project strength, and so being called a chicken really set him off, and he really said that he didn't like that question.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right. Well, all eyes have been on the markets both domestically and really around the world since these tariffs were first announced a few weeks ago. How are markets reacting now this week, Zac?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>So after the tariffs were paused, you saw a little bit of a spike in the markets. Obviously, the threat of tariffs has led to some concerns about how that would affect the economy. There's been talk that that could increase chances of recession. U.S. stocks really showed little reaction to the appeals court decision having already pulled back from the rally sparked on Wednesday and Wall Street closed higher on Thursday, shrugging off the decision by the Federal Appeals Court. So I think the markets are still kind of taking a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Well, Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke with reporters after the appeals court ruling. Let's give a listen.</p><p>Peter Navarro:</p><p>Even if we lose, we will do it another way. And I can assure you American people, that the Trump tariff agenda is a alive, well, healthy and will be implemented to protect you, to save your jobs and your factories, and to stop ship and foreign wealth, our wealth into foreign hands.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Well, Zac, I want to ask you to predict the future, but what's next perhaps for this trade whiplash conversation going forward?</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>Well, there's other court cases out there, so there could be other court rulings that impact this, but it does seem like this is going all the way up to the Supreme Court. Obviously, depending on what the appeals court decides, this is going to be a battle for a while now until the Supreme Court brings some certainty to this. I think we're going to see a lot of back and forth on this for some time to come.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right, Zac Anderson covers the White House for USA TODAY. Thanks, Zac.</p><p>Zac Anderson:</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>A group of deaf Americans who previously forced the White House to provide American sign language interpreters during press briefings is asking a federal judge to again, intervene after President Trump halted their use in January. In a lawsuit filed earlier this week, the National Association of the Deaf argued that the Trump White House's removal of ASL interpreters at press conferences and briefings violates federal law. The same group previously forced the White House to provide interpreters for COVID-19 briefings during Trump's first presidency and former President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</url> expanded their use when he took office. Trump in March declared English to be the official language of the United States and rescinded an executive order from 2000 that encouraged the executive branch to make services available to people of limited English proficiency, including ASL speakers.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>There are some provisions in the GOP tax legislation that may not have top billing, but they could have a big impact on American's everyday lives. I spoke with USA TODAY Senior Congress and campaigns reporter Riley Beggin to learn more. Hello, Riley.</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>Hey, Taylor.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>So let's talk through some of these lesser-known provisions that are lurking in this tax bill, starting with making it easier to ignore court rulings. What can you tell us about this legislation?</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>So this is something tucked into the bill relatively last minute. It's a provision that would essentially restrict judge's ability to hold people accountable for violating court orders. Of course, the context for this is it's coming as some judges are considering contempt rulings against President Trump for bypassing court orders, restricting the Trump administration's actions. So this legislation would bar judges from enforcing contempt rulings if they didn't first order a bond, which is usually set at zero or not ordered in cases when people are claiming the government did something unconstitutional. So Democrats have argued that this is clearly an attempt to go around the courts while Republicans say it's an incentive to stop frivolous lawsuits.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Well, amid constant headlines with AI, we know AI isn't going anywhere. This bill would allocate a healthy chunk of money toward AI. What might that mean and how else do they hope to tackle this?</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>So we're in a place right now with AI where there's no federal regulation for AI. And so in the place of the lack of federal regulation, dozens of states have created AI regulations and overstride structures. The provision in this bill would block those states from enforcing the regulations they've already created and it would prevent states from creating new ones. So this is a little controversial. Tech industry leaders, of course, support this approach. They are wary of regulation, say it can get in the way of innovation, but Democrats and some Republicans have said, this is not a good idea. We want to make sure that we are protecting people as AI is developed.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>And this bill would also create new savings accounts for children, Riley, am I understanding that correctly?</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>Yes. These are newly dubbed Trump accounts, and they are essentially savings accounts that will be created for children. If your baby was born between January of 2025 and January of 2029 and you opened a Trump account in their name, the U.S. Treasury Department would put a one-time payment of a thousand dollars in the account, which would then be invested in stock funds. Parents would be able to contribute up to $5,000 a year as well, so it would grow with the stock market. And then when the child turns 18, they can use a portion of it for things like education, apprenticeships and training or buying their first house. And then once the child reaches age 30, they could use the full amount for whatever they want.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right. How about some lurking provisions here as it pertains to Pell grants and student loan changes?</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>Pell grants are of course support for low-income students who want to go to colleges and universities. Right now, students who are on Pell grants are considered full-time and they qualify for the maximum amount of aid if they take 12 credits per semester. This bill would amp that up a little bit, change that full-time requirement to 15 credits a semester, which of course, if you continue to take 12 credits, it estimated a loss of around $1,500 in benefits for those students. And advocates who are concerned about this, say that that could create challenges for students who either are working or caretaking for siblings or parents. So it could certainly impact students here.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>As for migrants, there are some provisions dealing with new immigration fees and charging foreign workers. What can you tell us about these moves?</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>So one of the ways that this bill is seeking to offset the cost of tax cuts is by implementing new fees primarily on immigrants. So one thing that really popped out at us is a series of new fees for people who are trying to immigrate to the United States. So for example, $1000 to request asylum, $550 payments every six months for work authorization, $500 for temporary protected status, $1000 for undocumented immigrants who are paroled into the country, and $3,500 for people to sponsor unaccompanied children who are immigrating into the country.</p><p>And those are just a handful of them. There are many more. The other thing I'll mention is people who move to the United States to work and send money back to their home country could certainly see a chunk of their funds being taken out here. The bill would implement a new 3.5% tax on these transfers that are known as remittances, when people send money to a foreign country. That tax be paid by the person who's sending the money, there will be an exemption for people who are U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals that are sending money abroad.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Riley Beggin covers Congress and campaigns for USA TODAY. Thanks, Riley.</p><p>Riley Beggin:</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Thousands of people in Canada are being evacuated as active wildfires have charred hundreds of thousands of acres in the country, officials said. The blazes also threaten to waft heavy smoke over the Northern U.S. Some Americans could face poor air quality from the fires as soon as today. Active blazes have burned nearly 700,000 acres in Saskatchewan and nearly 200,000 acres in Manitoba, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center. A total of nearly 1.5 million acres have burned across the two provinces so far this year, according to the fire center. Smoke from the blazes is expected to fall heavily over Midwestern states, in particular, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, and cut across the country to reach the Carolinas by the weekend.

It is particularly important today as the frequency and severity of wildfires continues to rise, increasingly threatening the health and safety of communities.</p><p>\"By improving our wildfire knowledge, mitigation and response strategies, we can help reduce the impact of wildfires on our homes, communities, and economies,\" says the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. \"The federal government is providing funding to academia, not-for-profits, community leaders, and governments to advance wildfire knowledge and strengthen wildfire preparedness and risk reduction efforts across the country ahead of the 2025 wildfire season.\" </p><p>Although individual residents in fire-prone areas can take various measures to protect their own properties, many come up against significant obstacles, including monetary and physical demands of the tasks. Replacing a roof or making changes to structural elements of a home or building is prohibitively expensive to many, even though the measures can have a really big impact.</p><p>\u201cIt's critically important to ensure that we explore and seize every opportunity to prevent fires throughout our communities. I am very pleased to see continued funding being directed towards the project led by York University, as it demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding lives, property, and the environment. Working together at all levels, is key to creating effective and sustainable fire prevention strategies,\u201d says the Honourable Judy Sgro, Member of Parliament for Humber River-Black Creek.</p><p>That\u2019s where local governments have a large role to play to ensure their entire communities, towns and cities are fire ready. \u201cThings like fire breaks can help intercept forest fires before they arrive at the community and while they're still on public land,\u201d says Kennedy, interim director of York Emergency Mitigation, Engagement, Response, and Governance Institute (Y-EMERGE). \u201cWe're seeing the embers from one house igniting another house and the embers from that house igniting another house, and this chain effect now largely ceases to be a forest fire or a wildland fire and is instead an urban fire.\u201d</p><p>He points out there are a bunch of known improvements that local governments can implement to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and families to potentially devastating wildfires. </p><p>Many local governments, however, have not been able to fully take advantage of the resources and funding available. This project will help to determine what supports local governments need to implement wildfire mitigation measures, such as encouraging the construction of more resilient neighbourhoods and building new developments with wider roads.</p><p>\u201cWe are looking at current uptake of residential mitigation by local governments and how to expand it, get people working together on this and ensure programs are designed in a way that makes it as easy as possible for communities and regions, cities and towns to tackle this really urgent problem,\u201d says Kennedy. </p><p>Fire risk mitigation programs are designed to not only help reduce building ignition and loss but also help prevent the fire from jumping from one home or building to another, which can help save lives and property, while making it safer for firefighters.</p><p>The project will look at the social, political, institutional and resourcing barriers; strategies, programs or interventions to overcome barriers; partnerships with local governments; and best practices for establishing, monitoring and evaluating ongoing relationships.</p><p>The second piece of the project includes creating interventions to improve the uptake of fire mitigation efforts across the country and developing national surveys and case studies to gain further insights.</p><p>\u201cOne of the goals of the project is to share what we're learning, test drive some improvements and hopefully refine those over the course of the project,\u201d says Kennedy.</p><p>     Attachment </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>         Eric Kennedy       </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Sandra McLean York University 416-2726317 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sandramc@yorku.ca\">sandramc@yorku.ca</email>  </pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-9397978</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCH-RK73-RVJ4-K2X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>6:16 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

The question came from Col. Ricky Buria, a former aide to previous Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who has rapidly established himself as a key member of Hegseth's inner circle. The Signal inquiry raised eyebrows among other senior Pentagon officials, who wondered whether the request was appropriate -- especially from a uniformed officer, rather than Hegseth's civilian chief of staff. The National Institutes of Health halted funding for 14 out of 35 Alzheimer's disease research centers in the United States. Jacqueline Howard explains how that decision has left researchers and patients in a state of uncertainty. A 19-year-old man has been arrested on arson charges in connection with a southern New Jersey wildfire that has scorched more than 15,000 acres, prompted about 5,000 evacuations and briefly shut down part of the Garden State Parkway. Joseph Kling faces charges of aggravated arson and arson after a multi-agency investigation determined the fire was caused \"by an improperly extinguished bonfire,\" according to a joint statement Thursday from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office and the state Department of Environmental Protection.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: So it does take two to have a conversation. And if one side is saying they're talking, the other side is saying not, then there's a mismatch, there's a disconnect. You're of course right, Boris.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[14:30:12]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: Yeah, we should note, it seemed even that the Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, was having a different conversation at times than President Trump when they were talking Ukraine, because he said something that we did not hear Trump say. He said Ukraine is under attack. They are defending themselves. Ukraine, of course, an ally of America, but we did not hear that from President Trump.</p><p>Ambassador Aaron, thank you so much to both of you. We really appreciate the conversation. And we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:35:18]</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN HOST: We're learning new details about the extent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the app Signal. Multiple sources tell CNN the secretary was already using the messaging app on a desktop computer inside his Pentagon office. That computer was installed weeks before bombshell reporting revealed the secretary had used Signal twice to text sensitive military information in group chats. To be clear, the secretary's office is considered a secure space where cell phones are not typically permitted.</p><p>Now, in addition to that reporting, sources also tell CNN that after those chats were exposed, a close advisor requested that the Pentagon chief's information officer make an exception, allowing Hegseth to keep using Signal freely at work. That request apparently raised eyebrows among senior officials.</p><p>Let's discuss with former Trump administration official Kevin Carroll. He worked as a Senior Counselor for former Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. He's also a former CIA Case Officer.</p><p>Kevin, thank you so much for being with us. What do you make of this request from Hegseth to have this additional computer installed?</p><p>KEVIN CARROLL, FORMER SENIOR COUNSELOR FOR THEN DHS SECRETARY JOHN KELLY: Two things. One, it's ex post facto. It doesn't cover for the fact that he was previously using it without authorization. And then asking for the authorization was crazy. I mean, why would you put an insecure commercial app that can be hacked by a foreign signals intelligence service on any communications device related to the secretary of defense, especially when he has the most robust communication staff of anybody in the government beyond the president?</p><p>SANCHEZ: You have written about some of the reasons why some of these cabinet officials might be using Signal, and your argument essentially boils down to the idea that they are trying to keep some of these conversations away from the public.</p><p>K. CARROLL: Absolutely. They're trying to evade the Presidential Record Keepings Act and the Freedom of Information Act, which applies to any senior political appointee. And one of the things that shows that I think they're up to no good here is they're not including any uniformed military in these chats so far as we know.</p><p>And I think the reason is that the uniformed military officers would have appropriately said, guys, we can't talk about top secret information on your commercial, unsecure app. So there's really no good reason that they're having these Signal chats among themselves.</p><p>SANCHEZ: You also argue that the Department of Justice is giving them a free pass at doing this. I wonder what you think Attorney General Pam Bondi should do and if she should file charges.</p><p>K. CARROLL: Absolutely. She should ask the FBI director to investigate the secretary of defense for a possible violation of the Espionage Act, specifically 18 U.S. Code section 793. It's the sort of thing that I've defended service members that have been accused of violating it, and certainly if this was anybody but the secretary of defense, there would be such an investigation.</p><p>The secretary was speaking at the Army War College yesterday. I graduated from the War College. I guarantee you every colonel in that audience when listening to the secretary was thinking to himself, I would be in the stockade if I did what the secretary did.</p><p>SANCHEZ: So I have to ask you about some of what we've heard in defense of the use of Signal app from cabinet officials, specifically the CIA director John Ratcliffe and the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. They essentially argued, I believe Ratcliffe specifically, that when he logged on to his government computer, Signal was already installed. Is that a reason to use the app? And does this mean that this is a problem that spans now multiple administrations?</p><p>K. CARROLL: It may be a problem that spans multiple administrations. What Director Ratcliffe should have done is say time out. How the heck is an insecure commercial application on my computer as the Director of Central Intelligence? And I would also point out that Director Ratcliffe, Director Gabbard, perjured themselves before Congress when they said that there was not classified information in the chat that they were engaged in. I mean, what Secretary Hegseth was talking about was the timing and location of an inbound airstrike. If that's not classified, what the heck is?</p><p>SANCHEZ: The Pentagon's argument is that nothing that he's shared is classified. So it's fascinating to hear that perspective. I do wonder about something that you mentioned in an op-ed that you wrote, that these missteps have essentially allowed some of America's adversaries to potentially access other sensitive information, other conversations that they might have on their personal devices, opening them up for blackmail.</p><p>K. CARROLL: Absolutely. You can only imagine the reaction in press and Congress if yet another Signal chat that Secretary Hegseth came out with is revealed. So they can hold that over his head. It's the situation in which you have to resign if you're a senior national security official and you have that kind of vulnerability.</p><p>And, again, when they say this wasn't classified, I served in Yemen with the United States Army. If anybody had said exactly where I was going to be and when I was going to be there in such a way that the Iranians or the Houthis or Hezbollah or the Quds Force could have found out, I certainly wouldn't have liked it. I certainly would have considered that classified information that could have gotten me killed.</p><p>[14:40:01]</p><p>SANCHEZ: So the exposure, the risk is the death of U.S. service members.</p><p>K. CARROLL: Absolutely. We're very lucky that we didn't lose airmen in that airstrike. I mean, the Houthis have been able to shoot down some of our most sophisticated drones. They have a somewhat sophisticated air defense system, courtesy of the Iranians at this point. So we're lucky that they're not mourning families right now.</p><p>SANCHEZ: I wonder what you make of the approach from the administration and specifically from the secretary himself to essentially go on TV and argue that these folks that he's fired from the Pentagon and that these stories that continue to encircle him are, at their core, an effort by people that have been entrenched in the Pentagon for a long time to avoid changing the culture there. Is that close to the truth?</p><p>K. CARROLL: No, I was embarrassed for him. I mean, Secretary Hegseth and I were both Army officers. The first thing that you learn is that you're responsible for everything your unit does or fails to do. You make a mistake, you accept accountability, you take responsibility. Trying to blame somebody else is not the kind of thing that we would tolerate in a corporal leading a rifle squad, much less the secretary of defense.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Kevin Carroll, very much appreciate you joining us today. Thanks so much.</p><p>K. CARROLL: Thank you.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Plenty more news to come on CNN NEWS CENTRAL, including a warning from researchers who say that a pause in federal funding has left critical Alzheimer's studies in limbo.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:45:59]</p><p>KEILAR: Important research on Alzheimer's now hangs in the balance as the National Institutes of Health pauses funding for a number of studies. Lawmakers tell CNN that the Trump administration's freeze on $65 million for research has impacted several Alzheimer's research centers. CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard has more.</p><p>JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: There are many researchers in the Alzheimer's space who are on edge right now. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. Some have not yet heard whether their funding will be renewed. Their biggest fear is possibly having to end clinical trials early due to a lack in funding.</p><p>Now, what we do know is that in March, NIH halted funding for 14 of the 35 Alzheimer's disease research centers here in the United States. That's about $65 million in funding. We're being told that it's at those centers where some research is currently left in limbo.</p><p>One scientist at Stanford told me that his team had to hold off on starting any new Alzheimer's studies because they are still waiting to see whether their funding will be renewed. They were expecting a decision around February. Their funding completely ran out about three weeks ago.</p><p>Another researcher based in Florida told me that his team has developed an app that can assess your risk for Alzheimer's, but it may never be released to the public because he's also waiting to see whether funding will be renewed.</p><p>And separately, just this week, the National Institutes of Health put out a policy notice saying that it will pull medical research funding from universities with diversity and inclusion programs and any boycotts of Israeli companies because those two things would be a violation of federal anti-discriminatory laws. That appears to be a blanket guideline.</p><p>This also has Alzheimer's researchers on edge because if their institutions are penalized under this policy, they could see their funding cut off. Keep in mind, NIH is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, so any move that NIH makes will have sweeping consequences.</p><p>KEILAR: Jacqueline Howard, thank you for that. And next, New Jersey officials accuse a teenager of starting a wildfire that has burned 15,000 acres and prompted thousands of people to evacuate. We'll have that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:53:00]</p><p>SANCHEZ: New today, a 19-year-old is facing arson charges in connection with a wildfire that scorched at least 15,000 acres in southern New Jersey and forced thousands of people to evacuate. The state's forest fire service says a damage assessment is underway right now with a fire about 50% contained. CNN's Jason Carroll joins us now with the details.</p><p>So, Jason, what can you tell us about this suspect?</p><p>JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's start with his name, Boris. According to fire officials, his name is Joseph Kling. He's 19 years old. So far, he's been charged with arson and aggravated arson. There's a mugshot that you see for him right there. And in terms of how this whole thing got started, according to fire officials, they say Kling was out in a wooded area.</p><p>He had set some wooded pallets on fire and then apparently left the area without extinguishing the fire that he had set there, which, of course, started everything that we saw there starting on Tuesday. You see some of the images from this wildfire that crossed its way across the state of New Jersey, burning some 15,000 acres. It triggered thousands of evacuations.</p><p>At one point, portions of the Garden State Freeway, our parkway, actually had to be temporarily shut down so firefighters could get in there and do what they needed to do. The thing that is fortunate about this, so far we are told that no homes have been destroyed. Certainly, several structures have been threatened.</p><p>New Jersey's acting governor said the following. She said, \"We've truly averted a major disaster.\" So, once again, that 19-year-old suspect is in custody. His name is Joseph Kling. He is a New Jersey resident charged not only with arson, but aggravated arson.</p><p>Boris?</p><p>SANCHEZ: And Jason, do you have an update for us on where the effort to put the fire out stands? How are firefighters handling the blaze right now?</p><p>J. CARROLL: Well, sure. I mean, look, you look at some of the conditions that they've been dealing with out there. Low humidity, for one. Drought in the area. You're talking about an area that covers about one million acres. Of course, this is New Jersey's Pine Barrens area. It's very rural. It certainly is a wide area that firefighters have to deal with.</p><p>[14:55:16] But they're certainly getting a hand on it at this point. We're told it's very rural. It certainly is a wide area that firefighters have to deal with. But they're certainly getting a hand on it at this point. We're told it's 50% contained. They are expecting full containment as things are progressing right now, full containment by the weekend.</p><p>Boris?</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yeah, that full containment can't come soon enough. Jason Carroll, thank you so much for the update.</p><p>Next, back to that head-scratching moment in the Oval Office as President Trump says that Russia is making concessions in peace talks with Ukraine by ending the war instead of taking the entire country. We'll discuss in just moments.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2025042410CNV19</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNNEC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN5-HXV3-RS82-83N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2208\"/><timeReceived>02:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Cable News Network, Inc.

The latter two municipalities are part of the Monterrey metropolitan zone.</p><p>Garca also told Milenio that many of the fires had started in vacant lots. </p><p>Gov. Garca said that air support and members of the state's Phoenix Brigade and Civil Protection, as well as the federal Defense Ministry (Defensa), National Guard and National Forestry Commission (Conafor), continue to work to put down the state's remaining fires. </p><p>In Monterrey, a forest fire is currently affecting three hectares on Cerro del Topo Chico mountain. The fire is 50% contained and is 40% under control, authorities said. </p><p>In Santa Catarina, flames have damaged 23 hectares along the Garca highway. According to authorities, the fire started in a vacant lot before spreading to a car lot and then an auto parts store.</p><p>Conditions at a fire along the highway between the municipalities of Santa Catarina and Garca were worsened by smoke from a nearby wildfire on the Cerro del Topo Chico mountain. (Cuartoscuro)</p><p>In Garca, 20 hectares have been consumed by fire, which also originated in a vacant lot before spreading to the buildings of several companies in the area.</p><p>Monterrey was the most affected, with 73 reports of fires.

According to news reporting originating in Fuzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The acceleration of global warming and intensifying global climate anomalies have led to a rise in the frequency of wildfires. However, most existing research on wildfire fields focuses primarily on wildfire identification and prediction, with limited attention given to the intelligent interpretation of detailed information, such as fire front within fire region.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key Research &amp; Development Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Fuzhou University, \"To address this gap, advance the analysis of fire front in UAV-captured visible images, and facilitate future calculations of fire behavior parameters, a new method is proposed for the intelligent segmentation and fire front interpretation of wildfire regions. This proposed method comprises three key steps: deep learning-based fire segmentation, boundary tracking of wildfire regions, and fire front interpretation. Specifically, the YOLOv7-tiny model is enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), which integrates channel and spatial attention mechanisms to improve the model's focus on wildfire regions and boost the segmentation precision. Experimental results show that the proposed method improved detection and segmentation precision by 3.8 % and 3.6 %, respectively, compared to existing approaches, and achieved an average segmentation frame rate of 64.72 Hz, which is well above the 30 Hz threshold required for real-time fire segmentation. Furthermore, the method's effectiveness in boundary tracking and fire front interpreting was validated using an outdoor grassland fire fusion experiment's real fire image data. Additional tests were conducted in southern New South Wales, Australia, using data that confirmed the robustness of the method in accurately interpreting the fire front. The findings of this research have potential applications in dynamic data-driven forest fire spread modeling and fire digital twinning areas.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/makemoneyokk/fire-segmentation-interpretation.git.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Intelligent Segmentation of Wildfire Region and Interpretation of Fire Front In Visible Light Images From the Viewpoint of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Uav).

New York City is experiencing its longest rainless streak in recorded history. Dry conditions contributed to a forest fire that broke out in Prospect Park last week.</p><p>The news comes as fully 15 New York counties are under a drought warning, and as first responders work to contain the Jennings Creek Fire, New York's largest forest fire in 16 years. Meanwhile, every state in the Northeast is under at least a drought watch.</p><p>Food &amp; Water Watch New York State Director Laura Shindell issued the following statement:</p><p>\"Drought, water shortages and forest fires are a preview of life on a burning planet. Safe water and public safety are hanging in the balance. If this isn't a time for climate action, I don't know what is. Future-proofing our water infrastructure, bolstering energy and water efficiency, and sustainably managing our forests will require billions of dollars -- Governor Hochul needs to sign the Climate Change Superfund Act now to ensure that the fossil fuel polluters that got us into this crisis foot the bill.\"</p><p>Climate change fueled droughts reduce available water supplies and worsen water quality, concentrating pollutants in the remaining supply. Long-term drought conditions can deplete available water supplies, prompting mandatory conservation orders. This could cause hardship on New Yorkers, who are already being asked to cut back on essential water uses, like showers and toilet flushing. Reducing hygienic water use can jeopardize public health and drive adverse mental health outcomes from the stress of reduced access to life's most basic necessity.</p><p>The Climate Change Superfund Act, passed by the legislature in June, would make the biggest fossil fuel companies in New York pay $3 billion every year into a state fund earmarked for climate resiliency efforts, lessening the load on taxpayers and future-proofing our communities.

Johnson) are two of the most important bills of the 2025 legislative session. I'm excited to sign both today. Since our founding, our civic responsibilities have been a fundamental part of education, however in recent decades we have strayed from these basic education requirements. Foundational civic education in our high schools will aid our students with a better understanding of our government institutions and their critical role in American society.</p><p>\"Additionally, I'm thrilled Utah State University is taking the lead to pilot a redesign of general education through the new center for civics excellence. This center will be tasked with building out a general education curriculum focused on viewpoint diversity, civil discourse and helping our students develop the analytical skills necessary to contribute in the public square. This curriculum will be a model for all our public institutions in Utah and nationally.\"</p><p>Gov. Cox issued a veto of S.B. 37, Minimum Basic Tax Rate Amendments.

The cause of the fires is unknown. Firefighters in the Carolinas were battling wildfires Tuesday as patches of the region wrestled with drought-like conditions and high winds just months after Hurricane Helene overwhelmed much of western North Carolina with historic flooding. In North Carolina, firefighters from across the state have converged on rural Polk County to\u00a0battle at least three blazes\u00a0that have scorched over seven square miles, destroyed at least three homes and multiple other buildings and forced mandatory evacuations. The Black Cove Fire had scorched less than 4 square miles ? but it raged less than 2 miles from the town of Saluda, remained 0% contained and had spread into Henderson County. Firefighting efforts have been hindered by the impact of Helene as debris remains in forests and some roads. Dry conditions that have prevailed across much of North Carolina and South Carolina for weeks have created an \"elevated fire risk.\" Windy conditions on Tuesday and Wednesday were expected to add to the problem. North Carolina Gov Josh Stein lauded the state Forest Service, the State Emergency Response Team and firefighters from across state for their efforts. \"Thank you for doing everything to keep folks safe,\" Stein said in a social media post. Fire rages near Saluda and 135-year-old store In Saluda, Thompson's Store on Main Street dates back to 1890 and claims to be the state's oldest grocery. Saluda had a serious fire threat earlier this month when a brush fire raced out of control, and the store noted on Facebook that \"our tiny town is yet again facing destruction.\" The town survived that blaze. The latest fire has resulted in some mandatory evacuations, but Thompson's proprietor sounded more upbeat Tuesday. \"No worries, Thompson's Store is safe,\" Lindsey Holmes said in an email to USA TODAY. \"The firefighters are doing everything they can to prevent the fire from spreading across\u00a0the interstate!!\" Wildfire map: Carolina fires set thousands of acres ablaze National Guard aids firefighters in South Carolina In South Carolina, fire crews worked to quell flames in the mountainous areas of Greenville and Pickens County. According to the Greenville County Emergency Management, multiple agencies were attempting to put out large\u00a0fires in the Persimmon Ridge area of Greenville County. The fires started Saturday and coincided with a fire in Table Rock State Park. \u00a0 The National Guard said it was continuing helicopter water drops to combat the blazes. \"The South Carolina National Guard is committed to supporting local and state agencies,\" the agency said in a social media post. \"Always ready, Always there!\" State of emergency declared: Wildfires rage out of control in the Carolinas Did Helene leave NC susceptible to wildfires? Helene's deluge across western North Carolina in September resulted in widespread, deadly flooding and landslides ? followed by a severe drought during a warm winter and early spring, drying out vegetation. Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist and climate change expert at AccuWeather, said the hurricane also left behind lots of dead trees and fallen branches, debris that became kindling. In addition, he said, the chances of a damaging blaze have been enhanced by stronger winds than usual and a large number of insects surviving the mild winter and harming trees. \"You add all those factors together, it set us up for high fire risk in areas where you don't usually think of big fires,'' Anderson said. \"You usually think about the West. But the table was certainly set for fires, at least for this particular year.'' Read more here. 'Table was set for fires': Western North Carolina burned by Helene aftermath 'Very high' fire danger spreads across California The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection this week released the last in a series of maps updating long-term fire danger around the state. The area of \"high\" and \"very high\" severity zones has increased by 168% since the last assessment in 2011, according to an analysis by the nonprofit, nonpartisan CalMatters. \"With a few notable areas where the orange and red tide receded, like the hills above Berkeley and Oakland, territory deemed 'high' or 'very high' hazard exploded across the state,\" CalMatters wrote. The zones are important to builders who will face specific building code requirements and must keep burn-free areas around buildings to curb the spread of fires.\u00a0 Wildfire contained in New Jersey In New Jersey the updates were encouraging. The state Forest Fire Services reported 100% containment of a 2,336-acre wildfire burning in Wharton State Forest that had been closing in on 18 homes, businesses and other structures.

No matter what you try, the new generation of bots keeps advancing, insatiably consuming data to train AI models that are currently in the grip of competitive hyper-growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But with traditional approaches for limiting bot behavior, such as a robots.txt file, looking increasingly long in the tooth, a solution of sorts might be on the horizon through work being carried out by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) AI Preferences Working Group (AIPREF).</p><p>The AIPREF Working Group is meeting this week in Brussels, where it hopes to continue its work to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ietf.org/blog/aipref-wg/\">lay the groundwork</url> for a new robots.txt-like system for websites that will signal to AI systems what is and isn't off limits.</p><p>The group will try to define two mechanisms to contain AI scrapers, starting with \"a common vocabulary to express authors' and publishers' preferences regarding use of their content for AI training and related tasks.\"</p><p>Second, it will develop a \"means of attaching that vocabulary to content on the internet, either by embedding it in the content or by formats similar to robots.txt, and a standard mechanism to reconcile multiple expressions of preferences.\"</p><p>AIPREF Working Group Co-chairs Mark Nottingham and Suresh Krishnan <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ietf.org/blog/aipref-wg/\">described</url> the need for change in a blog post:</p><p>\"Right now, AI vendors use a confusing array of non-standard signals in the robots.txt file and elsewhere to guide their crawling and training decisions,\" they wrote. \"As a result, authors and publishers lose confidence that their preferences will be adhered to, and resort to measures like blocking their IP addresses.\"</p><p>The AIPREF Working Group <url normalizedValue=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aipref/history/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">has promised</url> to turn its ideas around the biggest change to the way websites signal their preferences since robots.txt was first used in 1994 into something concrete by mid-year.</p><h>Parasitic AI</h><p>The initiative comes at a time when concern over AI scraping is growing across the publishing industry. This is playing out differently across countries, but governments keen to encourage local AI development haven't always been quick to defend content creators.</p><p>In 2023, Google was hit by a lawsuit, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/google-defeats-class-action-over-ai-training-data-now-2024-06-06/\">later dismissed</url>, alleging that its AI had scraped copyrighted material. In 2025, UK Channel 4 TV executive Alex Mahon <url normalizedValue=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/15679/html/\">told British MPs</url> that the British government's proposed scheme to allow AI companies to train models on content unless publishers opted out would result in the \"scraping of value from our creative industries.\"</p><p>At issue in these cases is the principle of taking copyrighted content to train AI models, rather than the mechanism through which this is achieved, but the two are, arguably, interconnected.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a separate complaint thread, the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, <url normalizedValue=\"https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/\">said last week</url> that AI bots had caused a 50% increase in the bandwidth consumed since January 2024 by downloading multimedia content such as videos:</p><p>\"This increase is not coming from human readers, but largely from automated programs that scrape the Wikimedia Commons image catalog of openly licensed images to feed images to AI models,\" the Foundation explained.</p><p>\"This high usage is also causing constant disruption for our Site Reliability team, who has to block overwhelming traffic from such crawlers before it causes issues for our readers,\" Wikimedia added.</p><h>AI crawler defenses</h><p>The underlying problem is that established methods for stopping AI bots have downsides, assuming they work at all. Using robots.txt files to express preferences can simply be ignored, as it has been by traditional non-AI scrapers for years.</p><p>The alternatives - IP or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2513834/cloudflare-offers-simpler-way-to-stop-ai-bots.html\">user-agent string blocking</url> through content delivery networks (CDNs) such as Cloudflare, CAPTCHAS, rate limiting, and web application firewalls - also have disadvantages.</p><p>Even lateral approaches <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2592071/one-rebels-malicious-tar-pit-trap-is-driving-ai-scrapers-insane.html\">such as 'tarpits'</url> - confusing crawlers with resource-consuming mazes of files with no exit links - can be beaten by OpenAI's sophisticated AI crawler. But even when they work, tarpits also risk consuming host processor resources.</p><p>The big question is whether AIPREF will make any difference. It could come down to the ethical stance of the companies doing the scraping; some will play ball with AIPREF, many others won't.</p><p>Cahyo Subroto, the developer behind the MrScraper ''ethical\" web scraping tool, is skeptical:</p><p>\"Could AIPREF help clarify expectations between sites and developers? Yes, for those who already care about doing the right thing. But for those scraping aggressively or operating in gray areas, a new tag or header won't be enough. They'll ignore it just like they ignore everything else, because right now, nothing's stopping them,\" he said.</p><p>According to Mindaugas Caplinskas, co-founder of ethical proxy service IPRoyal, rate limiting through a proxy service was always likely to be more effective than a new way of simply asking people to behave.</p><p>\"While [AIPREF] is a step forward in the right direction, if there are no legal grounds for enforcement, it is unlikely that it will make a real dent in AI crawler issues,\" said Caplinskas.</p><p>\"Ultimately, the responsibility for curbing the negative impacts of AI crawlers lies with two key players: the crawlers themselves and the proxy service providers. While AI crawlers can voluntarily limit their activity, proxy providers can impose rate limits on their services, directly controlling how frequently and extensively websites are crawled,\" he said.</p><p>However.\u00a0Nathan Brunner, CEO of AI interview preparation tool Boterview, pointed out that blocking AI scrapers might create a new set of problems.</p><p>\"The current situation is tricky for publishers who want their pages to be indexed by search engines to get traffic, but don't want their pages used to train their AI,\" he said. This leaves publishers with a delicate balancing act, wanting to keep out the AI scrapers without impeding necessary bots such as Google's indexing crawler.</p><p>\"The problem is that robots.txt was designed for search, not AI crawlers. So, a universal standard would be most welcome.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPWLD-3958587</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPWLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVX-8583-SC14-N019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><timeReceived>09:24 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 IDG Communications, Inc.

(<url normalizedValue=\"https://krdo.com/news/2025/01/14/black-forest-homeowners-worry-of-fire-risk-from-40-acre-vacant-property-filled-with-dead-trees/\">KRDO</url>) --  At least 24 people have died after a string of wildfires sparked in the Los Angeles area. The destruction has brought fire danger to the forefront of many Coloradan's minds, including right here in El Paso County.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Homeowners in Black Forest reached out to KRDO13 Investigates about a property that borders theirs, which they say is filled with dozens of acres of dead trees. They're concerned that the property is a perfect source of fuel for a wildfire.</p><p>The 42-acre property is located at 9050 Burgess Road, which extends about a mile up the road towards Hardin Road.</p><p>That's where Rick Christie and his wife have lived for six years. He can see the Burgess Road property from his back deck. Christie says he's watched over the course of the last two years as the wooded area has become infested with Mountain Pine Beetles, which has caused them to rot and fall over.</p><p>That same area seen here on the Colorado State Forest Service's Forest Health map in 2023, as having 41 acres of Mountain Pine Beetle infection.</p><p>It now has Christie concerned about the 'tinder box' butting up agains his backyard, which is especially worrisome as Hardin Road residents were met face to face with the Black Forest Fire in 2013.</p><p>Christie says he bought the property well after the fire torched through the area, but he was told that the wildfire had spread right up to his back deck, singing parts of it, while leaving behind blackened bark on the trees in his yard, still visible to this day.</p><p>An El Paso County spokesperson on Tuesday, however, told KRDO13 Investigates that they have no jurisdiction over private properties, adding:</p><p>\"El Paso County has no enforcement mechanism specifically for the bark beetle, or picking up dead wood off of private property. The Colorado State Forest Service says that the beetle is a native species that will alter forests but not destroy them. They play a part in helping to naturally thin forests out, preventing even greater problems from happening during potential wildfires.\"</p><p>An El Paso County spokesperson did suggest that a complaint could be filed with the County's code enforcement team, to at least put the issue in front of them and see what they could look into.</p><p>Meanwhile Black Forest Fire District, which is stationed just over a mile away down the road from the controversial property, tells KRDO13 Investigates they were not specifically aware of the 42-acre parcel and the swath of dead trees on it.</p><p>Now he wants to know what can be done to make sure this property is taken care of, if at all.</p><p>\"There's got to be something that we can do, just to relieve the nervousness that we have.\" he stated, initially pondering whether the county could do something to mitigate the risk.</p><p>One of their wild-land crew members explained, similarly, that they are not allowed to go onto private property to do mitigation, nor do they have the manpower to send crews to do mitigation for people's property, even if it were permissible.</p><p>For Christie, he says he considered taking legal action against the property owner due to what he and several neighbors along Hardin Road alleged has been a reckless spread of the Mountain Pine Beetle from the neglected property, costing them tens of thousands of dollars to remove dozens of dead trees from their yards.</p><p>He ultimately decided against it, due to the cost for litigation and the uncertainty he'd be able to definitively prove the neglect of the property.</p><p>It's a property that Christie says has remained undeveloped, since he says it was bought five years ago.</p><p>The El Paso County Assessor's database shows that the property is owned by \"Rabah Holdings LLC\", which included a mailing address for a law firm in Colorado Springs.</p><p>KRDO13 Investigates called that firm to ask about their client. The firm stated that they were no longer a registered agent with Rabah Holdings LLC as of November 6, 2023, and instead provided an Organization ID# for them through the Colorado Secretary of State. Our search of that ID, turned up empty.</p><p>However, an entity with that same name was found in the Wyoming Secretary of State database, which initially filed in 2019, and has a renewal as of January 2, 2025. The mailing address for the LLC was to a P.O Box in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. They were most recently registered with a Personal Injury firm in Cheyenne, Wyoming.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The real-life disaster simulation training based on virtual simulation technology for the participants plays an important role in the optimization of aviation rescue command structure,staff training,and the practical applications of tactical methods.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beihang University: \"In this paper,the mission-progress-step-scene(MPSS)model based on the discrete event modeling for setting up the collaboration training points in the aviation emergency management is proposed. The virtual simulation of aviation emergency management is conducted based on the virtual open scenario(VOS). The performance of the crews in the collaborative training is assessed comprehensively by using report-evaluationagree-do(READ)method. A helicopter forest fire fighting mission is developed based on the aviation emergency management virtual simulation collaboration training system,and verified with experiment.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results show that the complete process of 'mission modeling-mission training-training assessment' is formed,which can assist in rescuer training of other missions and improve the capability of participants in aviation emergency management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Research on collaboration training techniques based on virtual simulation for aviation emergency management.

He also checked snowmobiles on lakes as the snow brought some activity back out. Ice conditions vary greatly with some spots remaining thick and other spots wide open on area lakes. He also fielded wildlife complaints and assisted DNR firefighters with a forest fire investigation.</p><p>CO Marc Johnson (Hibbing) primarily worked ATV and angling activity. Recreational activity has taken a significant downturn in recent weeks as the seasons change, he reports.</p><p>CO Duke Broughten (Aurora) monitored ice fishing activity and reports that recent cooler weather slowed lake ice from deteriorating. Anglers reported moderate success for panfish. Few ATVs were encountered.</p><p>CO Sean Williams (Ely) reports angling activity slowed again and the few anglers seen reported very little success. Violations included angling with no license in possession and a fish house on the ice after the legal deadline.</p><p>CO Hudson Ledeen (Hovland) reports most anglers had little to show for their efforts, but some folks hit pay dirt and landed some quality trout. He reports that lake travel remains good and likely will hold up for the remainder of the trout season.</p><p>CO Anthony Bermel (Babbitt) reports lots of people were out chasing crappies, with some success noted. Enforcement action included fishing with an extra line, litter, driving a vehicle on a prohibited trail and failure to display ATV registration.</p><p>CO Megan Franzen (Silver Bay) reports that ice anglers were reporting varied success.</p><p>CO Trent Anderson (Tofte) reports that anglers enjoyed easy walking conditions on area lakes.</p><p>CO Don Murray (Two Harbors) reports most lakes are still were holding good ice, but conditions can change quickly.

Enforcement action was taken for allowing illegal operation of an ATV and off-highway vehicle registration issues. Fairbanks and his K9 partner Fennec also assisted in K9 handler interviews for the county sheriff.</p><p>CO Thomas Sutherland (Grand Rapids) reports many fish were biting in his area, drawing many out-of-state travelers. He took enforcement action for not properly licensing a fish house and not properly registering an ATV. He also is giving out road-killed deer permits as the local deer population is taking to the road ditches to eat grass.</p><p>CO Brian Holt (Grand Rapids) checked anglers and recreational vehicles, checked trapping activity, followed up on open cases and investigated a wolf depredation complaint.</p><p>CO Derek Peterlin (Brookston) investigated a report of anglers possibly targeting northern pike out of season. He received complaints of unlawful ATV operation within the city of Duluth. He also investigated a grass fire and took enforcement action for a repeat off-highway motorcycle violator.

During a detail in the Nemadji State Forest she took enforcement action against riders on closed forest roads and trails. The forest is closed due to spring thaw and the trails and roads are being damaged due to unauthorized use. She asks people to stay off the closed roads and trails so use is not further delayed.</p><p>CO Aimee Hand (Willow River) monitored forests for activity. Spring beaver trapping is also starting to pick up. Enforcement action included failure to display registration and operating a motor vehicle in a closed forest.</p><p>CO Gabriel Soriano (Hinckley) responded to multiple grass fires. Wind and dried vegetation has created an environment for fires to burn out of control rapidly, he noted.

According to news reporting from Nanchang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The understory fine dead fuel moisture content (DFMC) is an important reference indicator for regional forest fire warnings and risk assessments, and determining it on a large scale is a critical goal.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Jiangxi Normal University: \"It is difficult to estimate understory fine DFMC directly from satellite images due to canopy shading. To address this issue, we used canopy meteorology estimated by Landsat images in combination with explanatory variables to construct random forest models of in-forest meteorology, and then construct random forest models by combining the meteorological factors and explanatory variables with understory fine DFMC obtained from the monitoring device to (1) investigate the feasibility of Landsat images for estimating in-forest meteorology; (2) explore the feasibility of canopy or in-forest meteorology and explanatory variables for estimating understory fine DFMC; and (3) compare the effects of each factor on model accuracy and its effect on understory fine DFMC. The results showed that random forest models improved in-forest meteorology estimation, enhancing in-forest relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature by 50%, 34%, and 2.2%, respectively, after adding a topography factor. For estimating understory fine DFMC, models using vapor pressure deficit improved fit by 10.2% over those using relative humidity. Using in-forest meteorology improved fits by 36.2% compared to canopy meteorology. Including topographic factors improved the average fit of understory fine DFMC models by 123.1%.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The most accurate model utilized in-forest vapor pressure deficit, temperature, topographic factors, vegetation index, precipitation data, and seasonal factors. Correlations indicated that slope, in-forest vapor pressure deficit, and slope direction were most closely related to understory fine DFMC. The regional understory fine-grained DFMC distribution mapped according to our method can provide important decision support for forest fire risk early warning and fire management.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Estimation of Understory Fine Dead Fuel Moisture Content in Subtropical Forests of Southern China Based on Landsat Images.

Mount Wilson is known in Pasadena for its stellar views of the night sky and scenic backcountry trails. Drivers can actually see the trails and extensive network of critical communications from Interstate 210 nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fortunately, all of this infrastructure and access would come in handy when the Eaton Fire approached the southwest perimeter of Mount Wilson on Thursday, Jan. 9.</p><p>Unexpected but not unprepared</p><p>Forecasts hadn't anticipated how quickly the Eaton Fire would reach Mount Wilson that morning. But by 9 a.m. on Jan. 7, it became clear firefighters would only have a few hours to prepare rather than a day or two as previously forecast.</p><p>Unusually strong Santa Ana winds brought prevailing 80-100 mph downslope winds that devastated Altadena and other nearby urban areas. But just two days later, most of the fire's spread was occurring in the canyon southwest of Mount Wilson, rather than in the urban areas below.</p><p>Two federal firefighting teams Kings River Hotshots and Angeles National Forest Engine 310 as well as an array of state and county resources worked quickly to strengthen the fire's perimeter. To withstand the approaching fire front, everyone prepared for a strategic firing operation to create a buffer along Mount Wilson's southern edge.</p><p>Preparing for a strategic firing operation entails creating fuel breaks near structures, roads or other infrastructure, making them easier to defend when fire reaches them. First, excess fuel is cut away with chainsaws. Then, to add an extra layer of protection, crews use drip torches to burn the remaining vegetation. This creates a buffer or a void of burnable vegetation before the main fire arrives.</p><p>\"We did a little bit of defensive firing, but it was a very light amount,\" said Brad Rafeedy, a fire management officer from the Klamath National Forest and a branch trainee on the Mount Wilson portion of the fire. \"We're talking about three folks here, so just three drip torches. We wanted to use very little fire when fuels are in the critically dry condition that they're in right now. It doesn't take a lot of fire, especially when you have the winds that we had.\"</p><p>Crews had already been cutting as much brush as they could from below the parking lot and towers as the fire burned in the drainage below Mount Wilson. As the fire pushed up quicker than anticipated, fire leadership brought in Kings River Hotshots from the Sierra National Forest to perform a small strategic firing operation below the communication infrastructure.</p><p>Quick thinking and the right resources</p><p>The operation ended up being a profound success the fire impacted none of the infrastructure at Mount Wilson. Firefighters also picked up the few small spot fires that had the potential to ignite the other side of the ridge.</p><p>Rafeedy was quick to point out just how technical this operation wasit required quick thinking and the right assortment of resources, with a high-level understanding of fire behavior and how to use strategic firing operations to protect structures effectively.</p><p>\"The crews performed this operation with a lot of expertise and good timing and even maturity is what I would call it,\" Rafeedy said. \"They had the experience to do it well...and we were able to immediately start mopping up and catching slop overs.\"</p><p>While federal crews performed the operation, state and county crews assisted with holding the fire below the ridge. They picked up hot spots and made sure the fire stayed exactly where they wanted it.</p><p>\"We had a plan in place and implemented it when it was time, not too soon and not too late,\" Rafeedy added. \"These crews did what they're trained to do while working well with other resources. It couldn't have gone better.\"</p><p>The actions taken to protect Mount Wilson represent the most fundamental tool that firefighters have when fighting fire modifying the vegetation so it can better withstand fire. In these circumstances, it helps to do this type of work before a fire impacts an area.</p><p>Using fire to prepare for fire</p><p>The USDA Forest Service is leading the nation to make prescribed fires safer and more effective. We know that to protect communities and natural resources, we need to restore healthy, resilient, fire-adapted forests by using mechanical thinning and returning beneficial fires to these landscapes. Our work has taught us that we must work in the right places in the right ways to achieve the greatest good for both people and the environment.</p><p>These lessons certainly bore fruit on Mount Wilson, where the Forest Service had completed a number of fuels projects prior to the Eaton Fire, reducing fire intensity by limiting the amount of fuel present to burn.</p><p>These treatments have been taking place for decades, according to Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia.</p><p>\"Being identified as a high-risk landscape gave us the opportunity during the last two years to really ramp up our efforts increasing the pace and scale of how much work we're doing and where we're doing that work,\" Garcia said.</p><p>\"The investments we made for years, even decades, in a combination of treatments at Mount Wilson really paid off, especially since Mount Wilson has been threatened by several large fires just in the last couple of years with the Bobcat, the Bridge and now the Eaton Fire,\" he continued.</p><p>With this history of wildfire in the Angeles National Forest, Garcia recognizes that more work is needed to prepare for the next one, whenever it may come.</p><p>\"I think this is an example of the need for an all-hands, all-levels-of-government approach,\" Garcia said. \"Because there is no silver bullet, there is no simple treatment. But all these different pieces are part of the solution the fuels and vegetation management, the home hardening, ordinances around construction and how we respond together in a unified way.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127077919</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FJ7-V763-S6G4-44C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 7, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000CEE4</classCode><className>WILSON ASA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS483111 DEEP SEA FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC4412 DEEP SEA FOREIGN TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>WILS (OSL)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7S</classCode><className>OBSERVATORIES &amp; TELESCOPES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DURX</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CYGN</classCode><className>PARKING SPACES &amp; FACILITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The fire is burning in timber on state-owned and private land, approximately 2 miles northeast of Saluda, in the Green River Gorge.</p><p>Fire behavior has continued to be intense, with rapid fire spread and extreme burning conditions due to shifting winds and dry weather throughout the day. The southwest portion of Black Cove remains a priority to secure the fire perimeter and protect homes within the Skyland Acres area. Strategic firing operations continued throughout the night to remove unburned fuels between containment lines and fire area around the Skyland Acres area. Due to the high relative humidity recovery last night, firing operations had minimal fire activity which led to a safe and slow burn which concluded at 3 a.m.</p><p>The Black Cove Fire was first reported Wednesday, March 19. The cause of this fire was determined to be a downed powerline.</p><p>Deep Woods Fire: Currently, the Deep Woods Fire is 3,373 acres in size and 30% contained. The fire is burning approximately 5 miles northwest of Columbus in timber on state-owned and private land in the Green River Gorge and in the neighboring Holbert Cove community.</p><p>A combination of bulldozer and hand lines were utilized on the southeastern portion of the fire close to the Green River. By utilizing the containment lines, firefighters were able to complete successful strategic firing operations to protect homes close to Green River Road. The purpose of the firing operation is to bring strategic and slow-moving fire within the unburned fuels with the lower temperatures and elevated humidity levels overnight. A combination of wildland firefighters and structural firefighters were present throughout the night to ensure firing operations were safe and successful. Firefighters throughout the day shift will hold and strengthen this line.</p><p>The Deep Woods Fire was first reported Wednesday, March 19. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p><p>Fish Hook Fire: Currently, the Fish Hook Fire is 199 acres in size and 95% contained. The fire is burning approximately 5 miles northwest of Mill Spring on private land near Lake Adger.</p><p>Firefighting personnel have stopped forward progress of the fire and continue securing firebreaks along the fire's edges and extinguishing smoldering fuels. Containment is expected to increase in the coming days, and firefighters will remain on scene until the fire no longer poses a threat.</p><p>The Fish Hook fire was first reported Thursday, March 20. The cause of this fire was determined to be a downed powerline.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Community Meeting: On Thursday, March 27 at 6 p.m., the city of Saluda hosted a community meeting for Saluda residents. Fire managers and emergency officials attended to provide updates on the Black Cove, Deep Woods and Fish Hook fires. For those unable to attend the meeting, the city of Saluda recorded it and will make it available for viewing via their website. A link will be provided once it becomes available.</p><p>Evacuations: Evacuation levels are constantly being assessed based on fire activity. For updated or current evacuation notices for Polk County, please refer to Polk County's website. For updated or current evacuation notices for Henderson County, please refer to Henderson County's website.</p><p>Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR): A TFR is in place at an altitude from the surface up to and including 5,500 feet, daily (24 hours) until further notice. Firefighting aircraft that respond to wildfires fly low in support of ground personnel. Drones can pose a serious threat to pilot and public safety. A drone that disrupts air operations also puts firefighters, residents and property at risk of loss to wildfire.</p><p>State of Emergency: On Tuesday, March 26, Governor Josh Stein declared a State of Emergency to expand the state's capacity to respond to the wildfires burning in Western North Carolina.</p><p>Statewide Ban on Open Burning: Effective 8 a.m. Friday, March 21, a ban on all open burning was issued statewide. All burning permits are canceled. No new permits are being issued. The ban remains in effect until further notice.

Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&amp;Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.</url></p><p>In service of this effort, Fox News directly contrasted Smartmatic with Dominion - the other big name voting machine company embroiled in false and unsupported conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.</p><p>'Smartmatic's strategy in this case has been to draft behind the rulings in the Dominion lawsuit,' the Fox News filing goes on. 'But years of discovery have confirmed one thing above all else: Smartmatic is not Dominion.'</p><p>In  <url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/dominions-billion-dollar-brawl-against-fox-news-suddenly-ends-with-shocking-settlement-moments-before-openings/\">April 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion some $787.5 million in order to settle a defamation lawsuit. In that lawsuit, Dominion claimed Fox News knowingly smeared them with false claims - turning the 'flame' of election fraud lies into a 'forest fire.'</url></p><p>Yet, for the network, the two similarly-themed defamation lawsuits are something not entirely unlike wholly dissimilar. That's because of who the plaintiffs are, according to Fox News.</p><p>'Unlike Dominion, Smartmatic was a failing business without a significant presence in the United States entering the 2020 Presidential Election,' the Fox News filing continues. 'Unlike Dominion, Smartmatic was mired in a decade of business failure due to inadequate technology, missing certifications, and involvement in multiple highly controversial elections. Unlike Dominion, Smartmatic was founded by Venezuelans and was embroiled in claims of fraud in Venezuelan and Filipino elections well before any controversy arose over the 2020 Presidential Election.'</p><p>Related Coverage:</p><p>In  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25924965-smartmatic-v-fox-msj-smartmatic/\">the Smartmatic memo, the company sticks to its guns and reiterated, in strong language, the heart of its lawsuit: that Fox News aired false claims and 'election conspiracy theories' about its voting machines during post-2020 election coverage.</url></p><p>'Fox deliberately deceived its audience with utter contempt,' the company's filing begins.</p><p>The locus of this contempt, Smartmatic argues, was not just airing the alleged conspiracy theories - but airing such unsupported claims while allegedly knowing they were false.</p><p>'Fox News systematically promoted the inflammatory and false narrative that Smartmatic - smeared as a dirty Venezuelan company - had deployed software throughout the United States to steal votes from President Trump,' the Smartmatic filing continues. 'The Murdochs and their executives believed this was a story that President Trump's supporters wanted to hear, so that is what Fox News told them even though no one believed it to be true.'</p><p>The Smartmatic filing describes Fox News' actions as an intentional smear campaign waged to maintain the loyalty of a pro-Trump audience.</p><p>From the filing, at length:</p><p>Fox's decision to embrace, endorse, and amplify baseless election fraud claims became known as the 'pivot.' Before the pivot, the Murdochs directed Fox News towards neutral ground regarding the 2020 election, which included allowing the Decision Desk to be the first to call Arizona for Joe Biden. But that call resulted in an unprecedented backlash against Fox News from President Trump, his supporters, and its previously loyal audience. Facing that backlash, the Murdochs and Fox News' CEO decided to 'pivot' and lean into election fraud claims they personally believed were baseless. After the 'pivot,' dissenters within Fox who wanted to tell the audience the truth were punished, employees associated with the Arizona call were fired, and advocates for election fraud claims were promoted and highlighted. After the pivot, for one month, Fox pushed the narrative that Smartmatic (a company that only operated in Los Angeles County) had participated in a criminal conspiracy to rig the 2020 election.</p><p>Filed in 2021,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=ZqsxqqUDfIW_PLUS_S/R0l9N35w==\">the underlying lawsuit - and Wednesday's filing - allege that top brass at the network were able to reap a financial windfall while Smartmatic suffered the opposite fate.</url></p><p>'Fox News' 'pivot' was designed to boost ratings, which it did,' the Smartmatic filing goes on. 'Good for Fox. It devastated Smartmatic. After decades of successful elections worldwide, Smartmatic believed its groundbreaking work with Los Angeles County would serve as a springboard for future success in the United States and globally. That did not happen.'</p><p>Instead, the voting machine company says, its employees received 'chilling' threats against their lives while Smartmatic itself found its business prospects and reputation 'destroyed,' according to the filing.</p><p>'Over 100 employees have lost their jobs,' the Smartmatic filing claims. 'Billions in value have forever been lost. None of this had to happen. And none of it would have happened if those in charge of Fox cared about Fox News telling the truth or the consequences of falsely accusing a company of committing one of the biggest crimes in history.'</p><p>Fox News, for its part, argues Smartmatic's reputational issues are problems of its own making.</p><p>'Election-integrity controversies have followed Smartmatic around the world, including in Venezuela and the Philippines, and in the U.S. where Smartmatic had to beat an ignominious retreat in 2006 following a federal national-security investigation,' the Fox News filing claims. 'Smartmatic was then boxed out of meaningful U.S. business opportunities because it lacked the necessary product certifications and technologies to compete. In 2020, it had just one U.S. client. Internationally, customers repeatedly rejected Smartmatic's deficient products and services.'</p><p>Each of the filings contains multiple pages of redactions; those redactions are made in line with a preexisting confidentiality agreement in the case.</p><p>Fox News, in its filing, offered an overview of its defenses. The network claims that Smartmatic has no valid damages, that there is no basis for punitive damages, that no defamatory statements were aired with actual malice, that the company itself cannot be held liable for relevant publication decisions, and that they are entitled to summary judgment under New York's anti-SLAPP - or strategic lawsuit against public participation - law, which can end a defamation lawsuit if a court determines said lawsuit is an effort to chill free speech.</p><p>In its own overview, Smartmatic claims Fox News did not merely exaggerate but fabricated claims about election rigging, that Fox News is liable for defamation per se, that Fox News is, in fact, liable for publishing election fraud lies, that those alleged lies were spread with actual malice, and that Fox News is not eligible for the 'fair reporting' privilege - which can mitigate liability when a publisher relays a fair and accurate account of an official document or proceeding.</p><p>Both Fox News and Smartmatic also traded dueling statements in response to inquiries from Law&amp;Crime.</p><p>'The evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on Fox News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech,' a Fox News spokesperson said in an email. 'Now, in the aftermath of Smartmatic's executives getting indicted for bribery charges, we are eager and ready to continue defending our press freedoms.'</p><p>Smartmatic's lead attorney, Erik Connolly, offered the voting machine company's strongly-worded take on the filings in an email.</p><p>'Fox is running the same playbook as other abusers, trying to sully the victim,' Connolly said. 'Fox cannot justify its month-long smear campaign against Smartmatic. Everyone from the Murdochs to the show producers knew they were pushing baseless claims. So, Fox is piling new lies on top of its old ones to try to persuade shareholders that its financial exposure is less than the $780 million paid to Dominion. It is not. It is much more. Fox will be held accountable. Fox's motion is a distraction, not a defense.'</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/a-decade-of-business-failure-fox-news-smartmatic-trade-jabs-in-sharply-worded-memos-in-defamation-fight/\">'A decade of business failure': Fox News, Smartmatic trade jabs in sharply-worded memos in defamation fight first appeared on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/\">Law &amp; Crime.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/a-decade-of-business-failure-fox-news-smartmatic-trade-jabs-in-sharply-worded-memos-in-defamation-fight/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXLC-ABLN10009188546979222946252015052010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABLN-10009188</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FPH-F0B3-RRYT-34B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><timeReceived>6:36 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

However, global characterization of post-fire dust emissions has remained qualitative and focused only on landscapes disturbed by relatively large wildfires. Here we apply principles of fluid mechanics to satellite measurements to quantify post-fire dust emissions. We find that 61% of global wildfires at various extents are followed by enhanced dust emissions, injecting 5.6 (3.3\u20139.2) Tg of dust per year during 2003 to 2022. 95% of the post-fire dust emissions are sourced to small wildfires, which occur more frequently and broadly than large wildfires especially across sparsely vegetated regions. Despite the recent decline in global burned area and a resultant decreasing occurrence of post-fire dust events, the total amount of global post-fire dust emissions has increased by 77% during the last two decades. This elevation in total post-fire dust emissions is attributed to intensifying burning and worsening fire-induced land degradation, which trigger a 155% increase in the intensity of post-fire dust emissions. With an ongoing enhancement of extreme wildfires and synchronized droughts under global warming, our results indicate the emerging importance of post-fire dust emissions globally and regionally.</p><p>Post-fire dust emissions have increased by 77% globally over the past two decades, and small fires account for 95% of these emissions, according to analysis of satellite observations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>Wildfires present an essential disturbance to the Earth\u2019s terrestrial ecosystem, capable of destroying vegetation cover1,2, biocrust3,4 and reducing soil moisture5,6, thus expanding bare grounds susceptible to wind erosion7,8. On the basis of in situ measurements, past studies have shown cases of post-fire landscapes becoming temporary dust sources9, 10\u201311. Using a combination of multiple satellite observations, Yu and Ginoux12 corroborated post-fire dust emissions on a global scale. They estimated that ~54% of large wildfires are followed by enhanced dust emissions, even over normally dust-free regions. This phenomenon has been reconfirmed by recent studies with more observational data13,14.</p><p>One key uncertainty in Yu and Ginoux12 is the omission of small wildfires. Although the analysed satellite observations well captured the enhanced dust emissions following the wildfires during the 20109 and 201210 burning seasons in the western United States, as reported by previous in situ and modelling studies, these two events have indeed been excluded from the inventory of post-fire dust events in Yu and Ginoux12 due to their relatively small extent of precedent fires (Extended Data Fig. 1). However, small fires naturally occur more frequently than large fires, imposing more spread-out influence on the terrestrial ecosystem15,16. For example, it has been found that small fires account for nearly half of the burned area and carbon emissions in Africa17. Furthermore, in contrast with large fires that tend to occur in moderately to densely vegetated regions, small fires are more likely to occur over sparsely vegetated areas that are generally more prone to wind erosion18. Therefore, dust emissions from small-fire-disturbed landscapes need to be assessed but with caution, especially for a false-positive signal of transported dust from nearby drylands.</p><p>Recent trends and future projections in fire occurrence and intensity have posed a question on the trajectory of post-fire dust emissions. Agricultural expansion has led to a steep drop in fire activities, with the global burned area declining by nearly one-quarter over the first 15 years of the twenty-first century19. Conversely, the ongoing global warming may increase future fire risks, resulting in elevated severity of burning20,21. As a part of the risingly severe fire-related environmental concerns, post-fire dust potentially imposes greater socio-economic and health impacts than dryland dust, due to its closer location to populated areas12,22. Given these climatic and socio-economic influences of post-fire dust, there is a need to quantify the emissions of post-fire dust and their trends.</p><p>To fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps, the current study aims to (1) identify global hotspots of dust emissions following wildfires at various extents, (2) quantify the regional and global post-fire dust emissions and (3) diagnose the recent trends in post-fire dust emissions and their potential driving mechanisms. We improve the identification process of post-fire dust events applied in Yu and Ginoux12, especially by filtering dust advection from non-local sources using principles from fluid mechanics (Methods). On the basis of satellite observations of active fires, vegetation cover and aerosol abundance and characteristics, we first identify fire events at various extents, as indicated by cumulative active fires within each 0.1\u00b0 pixel in consecutive seven days and then search for localized dust load anomalies during the vegetation recovery period (Methods). This improved approach allows us to compare dust emissions following small fires (\u226420 active fires during consecutive seven days per 0.1\u00b0 pixel) with those following large fires (&gt;20 active fires during consecutive seven days per 0.1\u00b0 pixel); the latter were qualitatively examined in Yu and Ginoux12. Subsequently, we analyse the post-fire dust emissions on a global scale and assess its recent trend integrated over hydrological, climate and continental regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A more complete picture of global post-fire dust emissions</emphasis></p><p>On the basis of the examined satellite observations of fire, vegetation and aerosols over the 20-year period from 2003 to 2022 (Methods), we identify 20,262,579 fire events at various extents on a global scale. Among the analysed fire events, 84% and 61% are followed by significant reduction in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and consequent dust events, respectively, during the subsequent vegetation recovery period (Extended Data Fig. 2). These 12,402,418 post-fire dust events are distributed across 188,423 0.1\u00b0 pixels, spanning over 12% of Earth\u2019s land surface. The most intensive post-fire dust emissions primarily occur in semi-arid regions in central Africa, southwestern North America, southern Asia, the intersection of Asia and Europe and sporadic areas in eastern Asia, northern and southeastern Australia, with the maximum amount of post-fire dust emissions over 0.1\u00b0 pixel ranging up to 1,679.6 tons per year (Fig. 1a). Among these hotspot regions, dust emissions following wildfires has been detected for up to 113 days per year; whereas in the majority of global burnable areas, post-fire dust emissions typically occur on 1\u201311 days per year (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global distribution of post-fire dust emissions during 2003\u20132022.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, The annual mean of post-fire dust emissions (Tg yr\u22121), along with hydrological classifications.

Approximately 5.6 (3.3\u20139.2 among different years) Tg of dust particles are emitted from fire-disturbed landscapes per year (Extended Data Fig. 4g), ~89% of which are sourced from arid and semi-arid regions (Fig. 1a). Additionally, the semi-arid tropical savannahs in Africa between 5 N\u00b0 and 15 N\u00b0 are the largest post-fire dust sources in the world, accounting for nearly 40% of global total post-fire dust emissions by mass (Fig. 1a). Therefore, in contrast to dryland dust that primarily spreads over northern subtropics and mid-latitudes, post-fire dust is mainly distributed in areas near the Equator (Fig. 1b).</p><p>The currently analysed models and datasets consistently show a contribution of ~0.28% (0.21\u20130.35% among datasets), or ~6.1 Tg (4.1\u201310.0 Tg among datasets), to global annual dust emissions by post-fire dust events (Extended Data Fig. 5). Africa is the leading source of dust emissions following wildfires, accounting for ~59.2% of worldwide post-fire dust emissions, followed by Asia (~20.9%), Europe (~7.9%), Americas (~7.2%) and Oceania (~4.8%) (Extended Data Table 1). Due to the regionally high occurrence and severity of wildfires, post-fire dust in the Americas and Australia accounts for a larger fraction of regional dust emissions than the global average, at about 0.19\u20131.28% and 0.31\u20131.20%, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5e\u2013i).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Small fires dominate global post-fire dust emissions</emphasis></p><p>Cumulative dust emissions following small fire events outweigh those following large fire events by a factor of 18.2 during the studied years, indicating the crucial role of small fires in global post-fire dust emissions (Fig. 1b). Indeed, over 85% of the identified post-fire dust events are triggered by no more than ten active fires detected within a 0.1\u00b0 pixel during the precedent burning period (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Particularly, latitudes (5\u00b0 N\u201315\u00b0 N) most prone to post-fire dust activities have experienced no more than eight active fires per pixel per event before the emission of dust on average (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Furthermore, similar spatial distributions are obtained between total post-fire dust emissions (Fig. 1a) and those following small fires (Extended Data Fig. 4a). That is, post-fire dust emissions are primarily sourced from small-fire-disturbed landscapes.</p><p>The overwhelming amount of dust emissions following small fires is a natural outcome of small fires\u2019 higher frequency and broader extent (Fig. 2). Averaged over the analysed pixels and across the analysed two decades, the occurrence of wildfire events decreases exponentially with increasing extent of burning (Fig. 2a). The currently analysed smallest fires, defined as those with one 1 km \u00d7 1 km active burning spot detected within a 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 pixel during consecutive seven days, occur 1.65 times per year per pixel; whereas large fires, with over 20 active burning spots detected within the same time\u2013space window, occur only 0.05 times per year per pixel (Fig. 2a). As a result, the occurrence of post-fire dust events following small fires is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that following large fires (Fig. 2b), decreasing exponentially from 0.96 post-fire dust events per pixel per year following the aforementioned smallest fires to 0.03 post-fire dust events per pixel per year following the large fires (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the background EVI and soil moisture shows wider probability distributions associated with small fires than that associated with large fires (significant difference confirmed by Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.01), especially in sparse-vegetation dryland regions and dense-vegetation humid regions (Fig. 2c,d), confirming the previously reported abundance of small fires across the sparsely vegetated tundra23 and alpine24, to moderately vegetated grasslands and savannahs25, to densely vegetated tropical rainforests26. Thereby, orders of-magnitude higher occurrence of small fires, especially over sparsely vegetated drylands, supports higher amounts of post-fire dust emitted from small-fire-disturbed landscapes (Fig. 2c,d).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post-fire dust events following small versus large fires.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Occurrence of wildfires and post-fire dust events as a function of fire extent. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Occurrence of post-fire dust events following small and large fires. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>, Standardized frequency of post-fire dust events as a function of pre-fire EVI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) and soil moisture (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>, Standardized frequency (lines, left <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> axis), emissions (stacked bars, right <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> axis) and intensity (dots) of the post-fire dust events as a function of post-fire EVI (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and soil moisture (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>).

Particularly, the intensity of post-fire dust emission, from landscapes with similar levels of post-fire EVI and soil moisture, varies little with the extent of precedent burning (Fig. 2e,f) and consistently reaches its maximum with post-fire EVI and soil moisture below 0.15 and 0.15 m3 m\u22123, respectively (Fig. 2e,f). Therefore, in spite that small fires generally result in weaker land surface disturbances, a climatologically dry, sparsely vegetated landscape is easily degraded to an erodible landscape, accomplished mainly by frequent, small fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post-fire dust emissions getting stronger</emphasis></p><p>During 2003<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2013</emphasis>2022, most K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate regions have experienced a significant, negative trend (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.1) in the occurrence of post-fire dust events (Fig. 3a\u2013c), with a total reduction of 193,961 (~30%) cases during the last two decades. This decline is more substantial over low-latitude, semi-arid regions, especially in Africa, the leading continent of post-fire dust emissions. Such reduced occurrence of post-fire dust events is attributed to the decrease in fire occurrence (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013c), consistent with the observed global decline in burned areas due to agricultural expansion19. Notably, the occurrence of post-fire dust events disturbed by small fires decreases more significantly compared to those disturbed by large fires (Fig. 3b,c).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trends in post-fire dust events during 2003 to 2022, integrated over K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate regions.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>, Trends in the occurrence (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), total amount (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) and intensity (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>) of post-fire dust events disturbed by all (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g)</emphasis>, small (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">h</emphasis>) and large (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>) fires. The leaning lines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> illustrate the significance of a trend, either linearly (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.1, Student\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-test) or monotonically (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.1, Mann\u2013Kendall test). Right- and left-leaning lines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis> indicate significantly intensifying post-fire dust emissions accompanied by prolonged post-fire low EVI and soil moisture, respectively. Basemaps in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis> created with Cartopy41 with data from Natural Earth <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(</emphasis>naturalearthdata.com).</p><p>Despite the recent reduction of post-fire dust events, an increasing amount of dust is emitted from post-fire landscapes, especially from areas disturbed by small fires (Fig. 3d\u2013f). For the presently examined tropical, arid, temperate and cold regions, the amount of post-fire dust emissions increases by 0.27, 0.18, 0.09 and 0.56 Tg, corresponding to a regional percentage increase of 70.5%, 77.5%, 38.8% and 274.2%, respectively, during the last two decades, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values lower than 0.1 except for the tropical region. Additionally, post-fire dust emissions caused by small fires increase more significantly compared to those by large fires (Fig. 3e,f), with the former dominating the increase in total post-fire dust emissions in the entire globe (Fig. 3d,e).</p><p>The combination of a reduced occurrence (Fig. 3a\u2013c), albeit an increased total amount of post-fire dust emissions (Fig. 3d\u2013f), suggests recently intensifying dust emissions from individual post-fire events (Fig. 3g\u2013i). The intensity of dust emissions following all fire events has increased globally, with a regional increase of 137.1%, 168.4%, 82.0% and 701.2% for the presently examined tropical, arid, temperate and cold regions during the past two decades. These recent changes in the intensity of post-fire dust emissions are controlled by the variation in post-fire vegetation cover and soil moisture (as shown in Fig. 2e,f). During recent years, a delayed vegetation recovery from fires in high latitudes (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c) in phase with an intensified regional burning (as reflected by fire radiative power; Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f), alongside an extended period of post-fire soil dryness in mid- to low latitudes (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013c), provide elucidation on the heightened intensity of post-fire dust emissions globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uncertainties insensitive to fire extent or year</emphasis></p><p>The uncertainties of the current results first derive from the identification of post-fire dust emissions, especially the filtering of dust advection. Our validation tests (Methods) have confirmed the general success in filtering non-local dust, as supported by a maximum-likelihood probability of only 26.4% of making false-positive mistakes (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, ~71.1% of post-fire dust can be detected in the near-surface layer (0\u20132 km) by space-borne lidar (Methods), suggestive of local sources associated with the majority of identified post-fire dust events. However, our validation tests also suggest that the methodology used for filtering dust advection from non-local sources appears overly stringent, with a maximum-likelihood probability of 75.6% of making false-negative mistakes (Fig. 4c,d). Nevertheless, small and large fires exhibit insignificant differences (both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values greater than 0.5 according to Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test) or trends (all four <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values greater than 0.1 according to Mann\u2013Kendall test) in their post-fire windiness and dust aerosol clustering, ensuring the independence of the uncertainty with post-fire dust emissions identification upon the extent of precedent fires and study year.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uncertainty of the method for filtering aerosol advection cases.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>, Spatial distribution of false-positive (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) and false-negative (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) rates, along with their dependence (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) on 850-hPa wind speed (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> axis) and level of aerosol clustering (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> axis). The probability distribution of the mean wind speed and level of dust aerosol clustering during the vegetation recovery period following the identified small (pink) and large (red) fires are identically attached on the corresponding axes of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>.

Basemaps in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> created with Cartopy41 with data from Natural Earth (naturalearthdata.com).</p><p>Uncertainties are also embedded with the quantification process of post-fire dust emissions. The conversion of dust optical depth (DOD) to dust emissions involves several simplifications and probably provides a lower limit of post-fire dust emissions (Methods). Although the mass extinction efficiency and dust lifetime we use are close to the median values derived from theoretical calculations and multiple Earth system models27, 28\u201329, possible temporal and spatial variations in these parameters may introduce bias to our estimates. Future efforts are critically needed to assess these spatio-temporal variations of mass extinction efficiency and dust lifetime, narrowing the present, wide spread of these variables among models and datasets as shown in Extended Data Table 1.</p><p>Furthermore, MODIS DOD data coverage is sensitive to cloud cover (Extended Data Fig. 9) and therefore insufficient for identifying post-fire dust emissions with the presence of cloud. Yet the MODIS data coverage shows relatively weak trends during the past two decades (Extended Data Fig. 9), facilitating meaningful trend analysis with this data.</p><p>Overall, the current study probably highly underestimates post-fire dust emissions, but to similar extents for dust emissions following small and large fires and among different years. Precise quantification of post-fire dust emissions, along with their long-term changes and environmental impacts, will be achieved through experiments within chemical transport and Earth system models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implications for the future of post-fire dust emissions</emphasis></p><p>Our findings reveal that post-fire dust emissions are primarily sourced from landscapes disturbed by small fires as a result of small fires\u2019 wider spatio-temporal distribution. However, it should be noted that our definition of small fire, based on 1-km-resolution MODIS images, differs from previous studies using higher resolution satellite-based detection of fires in Africa15,30, partially due to the present lack of a finer-resolution satellite aerosol measurement (Methods). Current and future developments in satellite-based detections of both aerosols and fires at higher spatial and temporal resolutions will unfold an even more complete picture of post-fire dust emissions.</p><p>The recent two decades\u2019 intensification of post-fire dust emissions is an outcome of the worsening post-fire land surface degradations. In particular, the post-fire EVI over high latitudes have experienced a significant decrease (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c), opposing the pre-fire greening trend (Extended Data Fig. 7d\u2013f) as previously reported in a wider geographical scope31,32; this post-fire browning is probably due to the regional combination of minimal changes in the occurrence of fire events (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013c), increased burning intensities (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f)33 and slower recovery of the terrestrial ecosystems from fires34. On the other hand, the trends in pre-fire soil moisture (Extended Data Fig. 8d\u2013f) during 2003\u20132022 seem to resemble the previously reported \u2018dry-gets-drier, wet-gets-wetter\u2019 pattern under global warming35. In sum, the recent intensification of post-fire dust emissions is associated with land surface responses to both hydroclimatic changes and wildfire regime shifts.</p><p>The long-term trajectory of post-fire dust emissions is thus governed by the intertwined changes in the atmospheric and terrestrial systems. Although the decline in burned area caused by agricultural expansion has temporarily counterbalanced climate risks19, the continued global warming is highly likely to increase wildfire frequency in the future20,36,37. Additionally, as warming weakens the night-time barrier to wildfires, extremely large fires are more likely to occur33, probably resulting in more dust emissions from those burned landscapes. Meanwhile, a possibly even drier future for the semi-arid lands38,39, potentially with longer-than-expected dry spells40, also presents a potential for even slower land surface recovery from fire-induced disturbances and thus a further heightened intensity of post-fire dust emissions. Overall, our study calls for attention to the ongoing increase in post-fire dust emissions with global climate and environmental changes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Satellite-based measurements of dust and other aerosols</emphasis></p><p>DOD is a column integration of extinction coefficient by mineral particles and describes changes in dustiness.

The above variables are obtained from collection 6.1, level 2 MODIS Deep Blue aerosol products42,43, and first interpolated to a 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 grid using the algorithm described by Ginoux et al.44. The single-scattering albedo at 470 nm is required to be less than 0.99 to account for dust\u2019s absorption of solar radiation and separate dust from purely scattering aerosols, such as sea salt. The continuous function of AOD and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent is based on the size distribution of dust towards the coarse range and to separate it from fine particles45,46; therefore, MODIS DOD represents the optical depth of absorbing, coarse-mode aerosols that are often dust over bare ground or sparsely vegetated regions. Besides, Baddock et al.47 found that dust sources are better detected using DOD with a low-quality flag (that is, QA = 1) than high-quality flag (that is, QA = 3), and thus DOD with flag of QA = 1 is used in this study. MODIS DOD products have been widely applied to identify dust sources44, characterize dust variation48,49 and model intercomparison50.</p><p>Fine-mode optical depth (FOD) is the residual of total AOD after subtracting DOD, which indicates the abundance of aerosols with relatively fine sizes, primarily smoke aerosols over active fires. Notably, due to the spatial resolution limitations of MODIS aerosol products, the current study is conducted at 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 longitude\u2013latitude grid (approximately 123 km2 per grid near the Equator), which may not be optimal for accurately representing fire, dust and contemporaneous changes in environmental structures over complex landscapes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Satellite-based measurements of wildfire extent and intensity</emphasis></p><p>Active fire product51 derived from the MODIS on board the Terra and Aqua satellites is analysed here for assessing the intensity of wildfires. The contextual algorithms used by the MODIS Collection 6.1 Active fire detections identify fires in 1-km pixels on the basis of the thermal anomalies. If the difference of temperature between the actively burning areas and neighbour land cover is above a given threshold, the potential fire is confirmed as an active fire. In the current study, daily wildfire extent is represented as the total active fire counts from both the daytime and night-time MODIS measurements, and wildfire intensity is assessed by the daily total fire radiative power. Corresponding to the spatial resolution of analysed aerosol data, the original 1-km active fire product is interpolated to a 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 grid using the algorithm described by Ginoux et al.44.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Satellite-based measurements of vegetation cover and soil moisture</emphasis></p><p>To explore the variations in vegetation cover and soil moisture disturbed by wildfires, the current study analyses the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS Collection 652 and soil moisture from European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project v08.1 product53. On the basis of spectral responses from the red, near-infrared and blue wavebands, the MODIS EVI can reflect vegetation greenness, thereby effectively monitoring Earth\u2019s terrestrial photosynthetic vegetation activity. Compared with the standard Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from MODIS, EVI shows improved capability to minimize canopy\u2013soil variations and enhanced sensitivity over dense-vegetation regions. Given the MODIS sensors aboard on Aqua and Terra provide 16-day EVI composite eight days apart from both satellites, here we combine the data records to obtain a higher temporal resolution (8-day) product. ESA CCI soil moisture is a quality-controlled muti-decadal (1978\u20132022) dataset merging soil moisture retrievals from various single-sensor active and passive microwaves into three products: ACTIVE, PASSIVE and COMBINED. The COMBINED product is used in this study to examine soil moisture in the top layer, which is integrated by ACTIVE and PASSIVE datasets following a ternary decision scheme. We obtain collocated 0.25\u00b0 daily soil moisture and 1-km 8-day EVI data for the nearest grid to the location of the dust pixel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Identification of post-fire dust emissions</emphasis></p><p>The post-fire dust events are identified following these steps:</p><p>We screen the daily 0.1\u00b0 active fire count data to identify fire events at various extents during 2003\u20132022. If the cumulative active fire count in a pixel exceeds a given threshold in consecutive seven days, the location\u2013time combination is defined as a fire event. To prioritize the identification of large fire events over small fire events, the thresholds are set in descending order (from 20 to 1).</p><p>Among these fire events at various extents, we identify those with significant vegetation reduction, that is, any 8-day EVI falling below the 10th percentile of the long-term spread during the subsequent recovery period after the end of burning and before the EVI exceeds its long-term 10th percentile for a continuous 16 days (Extended Data Fig. 2). The long-term spread for a specific 0.1\u00b0 pixel on a particular date of year is obtained by aggregating all EVI measurements within \u00b115 days of that date for that pixel during 2003\u20132022.</p><p>Among those fire events that induce significant vegetation reduction, we examine daily DOD and FOD measurements during the subsequent vegetation recovery period. A day with moderate-to-high DOD (exceeding the 50th percentile of long-term spread and the climatology of DOD for the corresponding month) from either morning or afternoon measurements along with concurrent moderate-to-low FOD (below the 50th percentile of long-term spread) from both the morning and afternoon measurements is considered as a potential post-fire dust emissions day. High FOD situation is excluded to minimize contamination of flying ash and smoke aerosols over active fires on the DOD signal, as flying ash and smoke aerosols are mostly smaller particles compared with dust. Whereas dust and other particles emitted during fire could possibly be lifted by pyroconvection to high altitudes and stay in the atmosphere for several days54, these during-fire dust emissions are assumed to exert minimal influence on the current identification of post-fire dust emissions because of the former\u2019s co-presence with fine particles and resultant tendency of being excluded due to high FOD. The long-term spread of DOD and FOD for a specific 0.1\u00b0 pixel on a particular date are aggregated from both MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua within \u00b115 days of that date for that pixel during 2003\u20132022.</p><p>To ensure that the identified post-fire dust emissions are disturbed by local wildfires rather than transported dust, we filter out cases with likely non-local dust sources. That is, among potential post-fire dust emission cases, only those with DOD values at the burned pixel exceeding those of the surrounding eight pixels are confirmed as genuine post-fire dust emission cases.</p><p>Compared with the identification of post-fire dust events applied in Yu and Ginoux12, methodological changes in the current study are summarized as follows. First, accounting for dust emissions following all fire events, rather than those solely following large fire events, results in an exponential increase in the total post-fire dust emissions but the relatively stable portion of local dust (Extended Data Fig. 4e\u2013g). Secondly, the criterion for identifying dust anomalies is lowered from the 90th percentile to the 50th percentile of the long-term spread, thus moderate-to-high levels of enhanced post-fire dust emissions are encompassed in this study. Nevertheless, the majority of the identified dust anomalies are from those extreme DODs exceeding the long-term 90th percentile (Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013d). Specifically, 66.5 \u00b1 10.5%, 24.1 \u00b1 4.0% and 9.4 \u00b1 3.9% of the post-fire dust emissions can be attributed to the dust anomalies falling within the 100th\u201390th, 90th\u201370th and 70th\u201350th, respectively, percentiles of long-term spread. Third, the influence of transported dust is filtered by screening out post-fire DOD anomalies lower than DOD in any of the surrounding eight pixels. Consequently, approximately 51.9 \u00b1 1.1% of post-fire dust anomalies are identified as transported dust (Extended Data Fig. 4e\u2013g), which are excluded from the current inventory of global post-fire dust emissions events. These filtered dust anomalies are primarily concentrated in regions near dryland dust sources, including the southern Sahara and Sahel, the Middle East and Central Asia, North America and so on (Extended Data Fig. 4b).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Quantification of post-fire dust emissions and their contribution to the global dust cycle</emphasis></p><p>Let us consider the columnar concentration of dust, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c6</emphasis>, measured in latitude, longitude and time. Combining the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives from classic fluid mechanics55,56, the time derivative of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c6</emphasis> at a specific pixel is connected with the local emissions rate per area  through dust advection  by the horizontal wind <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">v</emphasis></emphasis>, namely2</p><p>In the identification of post-fire dust emissions events, we have filtered out cases where \u2207<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c6</emphasis> is increasing towards the focal pixel, that is, any direction of horizontal wind results in a negative value of . Therefore, the actual emissions strength is greater or equal to the column concentration increase, . In other words,  provides a lower limit of the actual post-fire dust emissions strength. Averaged across time, the total post-fire dust emissions could be estimated by average dust load, during post-fire dust emissions events, subtracted by the long-term average. And the time interval could be approximated by dust lifetime in the atmosphere. The above sets the theoretical basis for our approach of quantifying post-fire dust emissions.</p><p>On the basis of satellite observations of MODIS DOD and optical properties of dust, post-fire dust emissions are quantified as follows:</p><p>We first estimate the DOD anomalies attributed to antecedent wildfires by subtracting the long-term, monthly mean DOD from the daily DOD to get daily DOD anomalies caused by wildfires.</p><p>We then evaluate the post-fire dust loading using the relationship derived by Ginoux et al.57 as follows:3where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis> is post-fire dust loading, \u03c4 is post-fire DOD anomalies,  is the mass extinction efficiency and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis>fire is the surface area of the pixel.</p><p>Finally, we convert the post-fire dust loading to post-fire dust emissions as the following:</p><p>4where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis> is post-fire dust emissions, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis> is post-fire dust loading and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis> is the mean value of dust lifetime from various ensembles of model simulations, namely Aerosol Comparisons between Observation and Models (AeroCom) phase I27, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)29, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2)29 and the inverse model developed by Kok et al.28, as summarized in Extended Data Table 1. For the AeroCom Phase I and CMIP5 with multiple models, the median values of dust lifetime are adopted. Consequently, the dust lifetime of 4.05, 1.68, 2.5 and 4.1 days are used for estimating post-fire dust emissions and comparing with the total dust emissions simulated by the above four datasets. Additionally, we also compare the post-fire dust emissions with global total dust emissions estimated by MODIS, which is evaluated by the annual global accumulated DOD following the quantification steps analogous to that applied for post-fire dust emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aggregation of post-fire dust emissions by hydrological, climate and continental regions</emphasis></p><p>Post-fire dust emissions are reported for different hydrological, climate and continental regions. The aridity index (AI) is a quantitative indicator of global dryness defined as the ratio of annual precipitation to annual potential evapotranspiration58. Here we examine the aridity index over the period of 2000\u20132022 using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data at a spatial resolution of 0.25\u00b0 from ERA559. Global land areas are grouped into five hydrological regions: hyper-arid (AI \u2264 0.05), arid (0.05 &lt; AI \u2264 0.20), semi-arid (0.20 &lt; AI \u2264 0.50), dry subhumid (0.50 &lt; AI \u2264 0.65) and humid regions (AI &gt; 0.65) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The hyper-arid regions, mostly unvegetated grounds except for a few scattered shrubs, have been excluded in the current study. The climate regions are defined based on the 1-km K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger climate classifications map during 1980\u22122016 updated by Beck el al.60. The K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger system classifies climate into five main classes and 30 subtypes61 (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 1), which capture biome distribution around the world with a combination of the precipitation and air temperature. The EF (polar, frost) region, covering mostly ice and snow, is excluded from our study. The continental regions are divided by standard area code according to the United Nations publication \u2018Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use\u2019 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/</url>). The global aridity index, K\u00f6ppen\u2013Geiger and continental data are all regridded to the same 0.1\u00b0 grid as the aerosol data following Ginoux el al.44, and then post-fire dust emissions detected within 0.1\u00b0 pixels are classified into corresponding hydrological, climate and continental regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Validation tests for the methodology of identifying local post-fire dust emissions</emphasis></p><p>To minimize the potential contamination from transported dust, only DOD anomalies with local DOD exceeding adjacent DODs are attributed to local disturbance from wildfires in the current study. Whereas this methodology of distinguishing locally emitted from advected aerosols stems from principles in classic fluid mechanics, we conduct three validation tests using realistic data to semi-quantitatively estimate the uncertainty in our approach associated with false-positive and false-negative identifications.</p><p>In the first validation test, MODIS FOD, as a direct indicator of smoke aerosols emitted from wildfires, is examined to detect whether this method effectively filters smoke advection from non-local sources, thus validating the theoretical differentiation between advected and locally emitted aerosol. First, we screen the daily 0.1\u00b0 MODIS FOD data to detect the abnormal smoke events, characterized by FOD in the centre pixel exceeding both the 50th percentile of its long-term spread and the concurrent FODs of the surrounding eight pixels. This step follows our identification of local, post-fire dust emissions events. Then we calculate the success rate of the above approach in matching the actual smoke source, that is, among these apparently local, abnormal smoke events, how often do we observe an active burning in the centre pixel that exceeds the fire counts from those in the surrounding eight pixels. A higher success rate indicates that the abundant smoke aerosols in the central pixel are more likely induced by local wildfires rather than transported smoke. Finally, we identify 324,078,033 abnormal smoke events globally during 2018\u20132022, with 67.6% of them being successfully matched to a local wildfire emissions source.</p><p>In the second test, we use space-borne lidar to distinguish between local versus advected dust, given their contrasting vertical distribution of aerosol features. Post-fire dust is generally near-surface dust sourced from disturbance of local wildfires; whereas transported dust typically distributes above 2 km, as it is uplifted to mid-to-high altitudes during long-range transportation62,63. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Operations (CALIPSO) is capable of observing the vertical distribution of aerosol subtypes64,65. To match with the spatial resolution of analysed aerosol data, daytime overpasses from CALIPSO Level 2 Vertical Feature Mask product version 4.51 during 2006\u20132022 are interpolated to a three-dimensional grid, with a horizontal resolution of 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 and vertical resolution consistent with the original products. Subsequently, we examine the presence of dust, polluted dust and dusty marine aerosols within 0\u20132 km at the location\u2013time combination of the identified post-fire dust events. We obtain 11,362 corresponding CALIPSO observations that match our MODIS-based post-fire dust inventory globally during 2006\u20132022, 71.1% of which have detected the presence of dust within 0\u20132 km aboveground, suggesting that these dust anomalies are largely from local sources.</p><p>In the third test, we estimate the rate of false-negative mistakes in our approach. We also use FOD data as an analogy to evaluate our approach of capturing local aerosol sources. Here we first identify isolated wildfire events, with active fire counts in the centre pixel but not in the surrounding eight pixels. Subsequently, by observing whether these isolated wildfires lead to an abnormal FOD that exceeds those of the surrounding eight pixels, we can get a sense of how much actual local aerosol emissions are missed in our approach. We identify 2,928,414 isolated wildfire events globally during 2018\u20132022, 19.1% of which have resulted in an abnormal, local FOD signal based on our approach. That is, the false-negative rate of our approach to identify post-fire dust emissions is about 80.9%.</p><p>Finally, we use results from the above first and third tests to estimate the possibility of making false-positive and false-negative mistakes in our identification of post-fire dust emissions. We first attribute the spatio-temporal variations in false-positive and false-negative identifications of local aerosol emission to (1) low-level wind speed, directly affecting aerosol advection and (2) clustering of abundant aerosols, influencing the local distribution of aerosols. The analysis on low-level wind is done with daily 850-hPa horizontal wind from ERA5. The level of aerosol clustering is defined as the number of pixels with moderate-to-high FOD (&gt;long-term 50th percentile) within \u00b10.5\u00b0 of the burning pixel. Lower success rate (1-false-positive) and higher missing (false-negative) rate generally collocate with higher levels of low-level windiness and clustering of aerosol plumes (Fig. 4b,d). The obtained dependence of false-positive and false-negative rates on wind speed and aerosol clustering, noted as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fp(wind, aerosol clustering)</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fn(wind, aerosol clustering)</emphasis> (colour shading in Fig. 4b,d), are subsequently used to estimate the uncertainty levels associated with dust emissions identification following small and large fires. In the latter case, aerosol clustering is indicated by number of pixels with moderate-to-high DOD (&gt;long-term 50th percentile) within \u00b10.5\u00b0 of the burned pixel; wind speed is obtained during the subsequent vegetation recovery period. The combination of low-level wind and aerosol clustering that maximizes their joint probability density is separately retrieved from the identified dust events following small and large fires and plugged into <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fp</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wind, aerosol clustering</emphasis>) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fn</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wind, aerosol clustering</emphasis>). This approach results in nearly identical maximum-likelihood estimates of these rates (26.4% false positive and 75.6% false negative) between dust emissions identification following small and large fires (Fig. 4b,d).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online content</emphasis></p><p>Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01730-3\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-025-01730-3</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This research is supported by NSFC grant number 42275016 (Y.Y.).

The primary objective was to assess variations in plant diversity, soil characteristics, and ecosystem services, specifically carbon sequestration and soil erosion prevention across six sites such as Khabeki (S1), Khoora (S2), Dape Sharif (S3), Anga (S4), Knotti Garden (S5), and Jallar (S6). Quadrat-based sampling and allometric equations were used to evaluate plant diversity and carbon storage potential, whereas soil erodibility was analyzed via the Universal Soil Loss Equation. Significant physicochemical and soil differences were found among the sites. Knotti Garden presented the highest phosphorus (17.2\u00a0mg/kg), and potassium (281\u00a0mg/kg) levels. The organic matter content ranged from 2.07 to 1.23% and the soil saturation ranged from 75.21 to 51.83%. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Justicia adhatoda</emphasis> was the dominant species in terms of frequency, density, and cover whereas <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acacia modesta</emphasis> presented strong ecological performance. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tecomella undulata</emphasis> at Dape Sharif stored up to 467,077\u00a0kg of biomass derived carbon, whereas <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mangifera indica</emphasis> at Knotti Garden sequestered 158,789\u00a0kg, indicating strong site-species carbon relationships. These findings highlight the ecological significance of site-specific management and native species in supporting sustainable ecosystem services in semiarid regions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Ecosystem services are widely understood as advantages that ecosystems offer to humans, i.e., they help make life on Earth both possible and worthwhile1. Ecosystem services, on the other hand, are the circumstances and mechanisms that allow ecosystems and the species within them to support and satisfy human life2. Several statistics have shown that the current century will face numerous pressing issues, as well as connected ones, such as significant losses in biodiversity or broad changes in ecosystems3.</p><p>The Soon Valley in Punjab, Pakistan, is an environmentally distinctive region with rich native plants and various microclimatic zones. Its major flora include <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Justicia adhatoda</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Acacia modesta</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Albizia lebbeck</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Olea ferruginea</emphasis>, which provide both provisional and regulating ecological services. These natural plants promote biodiversity, curb erosion, and offer medical and cultural advantages to local communities4,5. However, this fragile landscape is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances, including deforestation, soil erosion, and habitat fragmentation6,7. Several surveys reporting on biodiversity and floral composition have been carried out in the salt range8.</p><p>Biological services are critical to humanity\u2019s continued existence and socioeconomic activities, ecosystems, particularly terrestrial ecosystems, that enable the coexistence of many plant species and populations under unique ecological conditions9. In recent years, the notion that adaptive ecosystem management necessitates the recognition of the complex dynamics of the socioecological system has advanced to a fundamental level10. Yang et al.11 reported that they understood the ability to perceive the positive and negative effects of the socioecological system and that there was a multitiered, nested structure for this purpose. The biomass of shrubs and herbs was studied in the Kumaun Himalaya region by Awasti et al.12. to investigate the structure and function of the ecosystem.</p><p>Native plants in the Soon Valley provide ecosystem functions that are inextricably related to its high biodiversity. These plants create and maintain habitats that are essential for a range of species, providing ecological resilience and balance. Majeed et al.13 reported that native plant species such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ziziphus mauritiana</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acacia nilotica</emphasis>, for example, are essential for the survival of animals such as insects, birds, and small mammals. A variety of ecological interactions and processes that enhance overall biodiversity are supported by Soon Valley\u2019s preservation of a varied range of plant species. Despite its ecological importance, the Soon Valley faces numerous environmental challenges, including soil erosion, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation14.</p><p>The world\u2019s ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats, including biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and disruptions to ecosystem services15. The conservation and sustainable management of ecosystems are critical for maintaining ecological integrity, supporting human well-being, and promoting sustainable development16. Soon Valley, located in the Punjab province of Pakistan, is a unique and ecologically significant region harboring a diverse array of plant species and ecosystems5.</p><p>Indigenous flora are essential for soil preservation. Deep-rooted species mitigate soil erosion and enhance soil fertility by improving nitrogen cycling17. Moreover, riparian vegetation, including willows (Salix), enhances water quality by filtering contaminants and stabilizing banks, thereby preserving aquatic ecosystems18. Comprehending plant communities is an essential precondition in ecosystem ecology, natural resource management, and conservation. This knowledge is crucial for examining rare or rarely species and for formulating management measures aimed at their protection and/or mitigating habitat fragmentation19. The characterization of vegetation has established a solid basis for the advancement of the ecological sciences for numerous decades. Phytosociology (quantitative ecology) facilitates the study of plant species at both the individual and community levels in relation to their environment.</p><p>The idea of ecosystem services has demonstrated its utility in conservation and large-scale wetland restoration efforts. This notion offers a crucial framework for environmental management, particularly in terms of illustrating human dependence on natural systems20. However, other inquiries concerning ecosystem services persist, including the spatial distribution of these services and the methods for delivering diverse ecosystems. Further research is necessary to assess the valuation of ecosystem services21.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the phytosociological and ethnobotanical data to classify the vegetation of the Soon Valley and assess the impacts of human activity on it. It was hypothesized that variations in these ecosystem services are influenced by species-specific traits, site conditions, and land-use practices. The ultimate goal is to quantify the ecosystem services provided by the natural vegetation. The objectives of this research are to (i) to assess and quantify the floristic diversity and composition of plant species in selected ecotypes (ii) analyze phytosociological parameters, including species richness, abundance, and distribution patterns, (iii) to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the soil, icluding pH, organic matter content, and nutrient availability and (iv) quantify the provisional and regulatory ecosystem services provided by these ecotypes, with a focus on carbon sequestration and soil erosion prevention.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study site</emphasis></p><p>Pakistan, covering 796,095 sq km, has diverse geographic areas, ranging from the Himalayan Mountains to the Arabian Sea coast. The country has varying topographical features across its four provinces. The Soon Valley in the Salt Range receives 20 inches of rainfall annually, with temperatures ranging from 1 \u00b0C to 36 \u00b0C, and experiences hot winds, droughts, frost, and longer winters. The Salt Range, specifically the Soon Valley in Khushab district, is located between 71.30\u00b0-73.30\u00b0E longitude and 32.23\u00b0-33\u00b0N latitude. The valley has a semiarid and warm climate, with 250\u2013500 mm annual precipitation, and an altitude of 400\u20131000 m. The area is divided into forests (38%), cultivated land (22%), and rangelands (40%). The dominant plant species include <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Olea ferruginea</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Acacia modesta</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dodonaea viscosa</emphasis>. Six sites were studied from 2021 to 2023 to document the plant community structure and vegetation distribution in the semiarid rangelands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Determination of floristic composition</emphasis></p><p>Systematic field visits were made for plant collection in all seasons from 2021 to 2023 across six plant species in the Soon Valley. Vegetation sampling was conducted at each site via a stratified quadrat approach. Ten regular quadrats were laid (5 m2 for shrubs and 1 m2 for herbs and grasses), each separated by a distance of 10 m at all the selected sites. For the ecological attributes 3 replicates were taken for all of the studied parameters. All the plant species were documented inside each quadrat, together with information on their abundance and cover. The plant samples were carefully uprooted or trimmed, then dried, stored, and placed on herbarium sheets for taxonomic identification and reference purposes. The identification technique used conventional floristic keys from the Flora of Pakistan by Ali22 and Ali and Qaiser23. A detailed species list was created, and the plant families are alphabetized. In addition, the species were classified into life-form classes and leaf size groups using Raunkiaer24 and Hussain\u2019s25 categorization systems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation phytosociological sampling and analysis</emphasis></p><p>Shrub height and diameter from ground level were noted. The diameter at breast height (DBH) of each tree was measured. The names and numbers of the trees in each quadrat were recorded. The heights and girths of all branches exceeding 4 cm were measured.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frequency</emphasis></p><p>The frequency quantifies the proportion of quadrats within plots that include a particular species. The calculation was performed via the formula26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Density</emphasis></p><p>Density refers to the number of a plant species per unit area and is computed via the following formula26.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cover</emphasis></p><p>This indicates the percentage of the ground that is occupied by a particular species of plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Calculation of plant biomass and carbon sequestration</emphasis></p><p>Plant biomass was estimated using species-specific allometric equations, on the basis of diameter at breast height (DBH), plant height (H), and wood density (\u03c1). The aboveground biomass (AGB) was calculated using the following general allometric formula, adapted from Brown27:</p><p>where: \u03c1 = wood density (g/cm3), D = diameter at breast height (cm), and H = height (m).</p><p>The belowground biomass (BGB) was estimated as 20% of the AGB:</p><p>The total biomass (TB) was obtained by summing the AGB and BGB:</p><p>The carbon content was calculated assuming that 50% of the dry biomass is carbon28:</p><p>To scale the carbon per hectare, the carbon value per individual plant was multiplied by plant density per hectare which was obtained from quadrat sampling:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Collection of soil samples</emphasis></p><p>Soil samples were collected from beneath selected plant species at designated sites in a random manner. Four samples were collected, two from bare soil and two from soil under native plant cover. The samples were labelled, packed in zipper bags, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Chemical parameters such as pH, EC, P, K, Na, soil organic matter and soil organic carbon were determined following the drying and sieving processes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Physical parameters</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil saturation</emphasis></p><p>A saturated paste of soil was prepared and allowed to remain undisturbed for one hour. Additional soil or deionized water was incorporated as necessary to fulfil the requirements for achieving saturation. The soil underwent a filtration process, and the resulting filtrate was subjected to analysis for subsequent evaluation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil texture</emphasis></p><p>A 40 g soil sample was collected, sieved, and air-dried. The homogenized mixture was stirred for 10\u201315 min. The material was transferred to a one-liter jar, and the volume was adjusted to one liter. Silt and clay measurements were recorded after 40 s, and sand assessment was performed after one hour via a hydrometer. A temperature correction factor of 0.4*T was applied to determine the silt and clay percentages.</p><p>The USDA triangle was employed as a method to ascertain the texture of the soil.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chemical parameters</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">pH</emphasis></p><p>The soil pH was determined via an Inno pH meter. Standardization involved buffer solutions with pH values of 4.0 and 7.0. A reading was recorded 30 s after the adjustment electrode was introduced into the suspension.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electrical conductivity (EC)</emphasis></p><p>The electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil was quantified with a milliemens perimeter (mS/cm) via a conductivity meter (Semso-Direct Con 2000) to analyse the soil extract.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phosphorus</emphasis></p><p>The phosphorus determination was performed via an 80-D spectrophotometer following Page et al.29.

Examining its floral composition provides a foundation for conservation strategies and sustainable management practices32. This study concentrates on the region to enhance the understanding of Pakistan\u2019s flora, particularly with respect to ecosystem services. Floodplain ecosystems play crucial roles in regulating water and supporting agriculture while preserving cultural and recreational spaces that are essential to the region\u2019s identity33.</p><p>Generally, the physicochemical properties of soils vary in space and time because of variations in topography, climate, weathering processes, vegetation cover34,35 and microbial activities36,37 and several other biotic and abiotic factors38,39. In the highly dissected landscapes, bioclimatic conditions change rapidly and may vary within short distances resulting in a pronounced heterogeneity in soil types and their chemical and physical properties40,41. Physicochemical properties are frequently used for the estimation of soil quality42 however certain biological indicators such as microbial biomass, soil respiration, activities of soil macrofauna, and enzymes are reportedly to be related to soil quality and health43. Vegetation also influences the nutrient cycling to a great extent and plays an important role in the soil formation44. It improves the soil structure, infiltration rate, aeration and water holding capacity45. This could directly affect the plant structure and their function46.</p><p>The study carried out in the Soon Valley revealed significant differences in phosphorus levels among the six study sites, with the Knotti garden site exhibiting the highest concentration of phosphorus. This nutrient plays a crucial role in energy transfer within plants and serves as a fundamental component of ATP, which powers numerous metabolic processes47. Furthermore, the availability of phosphorus in soil is frequently associated with soil pH and the content of organic matter, which can differ markedly among various ecotypes, as evidenced by the diverse phosphorus concentrations found in the Soon Valley48. The variations in phosphorus availability are associated with soil pH levels; given that phosphorus availability in soil is significantly influenced by its pH, a connection that has been extensively recorded in the literature49.</p><p>The growth of vegetation plays a significant role in carbon sequestration, which is an essential ecosystem service amid the challenges posed by global climate change50. The high pH concentration at the Khoora site indicates the presence of highly alkaline soil conditions, which are typically associated with arid and semiarid regions. Yahaya et al.51 reported that the concentration of potassium varied significantly across different sites in the Soon Valley.</p><p>The highest concentrations of potassium were recorded in Knotti garden, which is located in one of the district\u2019s fertile ecotypes. This high potassium availability likely contributed to the increased growth and productivity observed in the plants growing in that area. Furthermore, the Anga site, which presented the lowest potassium concentrations, results lower agricultural productivity in that region. These differences underscore the importance of site-specific nutrient management strategies for maximizing agricultural outputs in various ecological contexts52. The findings of Yahaya et al.51 are significant for agricultural practices in the six district ecotypes of the Soon Valley.</p><p>A study conducted by Hussain et al.53 highlighted the importance of organic matter in enhancing soil fertility, notably revealing that the Knotti garden presented the highest concentration of organic matter. The increased level of organic matter in Knotti garden soil reinforces the notion that organic matter plays a significant role in enhancing soil fertility and promoting plant health. The abundance of organic material in the Knotti garden likely fostered a conducive environment for crop growth, leading to healthier plants and increased agricultural yields54.</p><p>Phytosociology is an essential field in plant ecology that involves investigating the structure and composition of plant communities by analysing key parameters such as density, frequency, and cover55. By examining density and frequency, one can achieve a thorough understanding of plant community dynamics and the environmental conditions that favour particular species. At Jallar site 6, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">J. adhatoda</emphasis> presented the highest density, indicating that this species is especially well suited to the environmental conditions present at this location. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D. viscosa</emphasis> had the greatest prevalence at Jallar site 6, indicating its extensive distribution throughout the area. This species demonstrates resilience and drought resistance, rendering it especially appropriate for semiarid and coastal habitats56.</p><p>The greatest densities of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A. modesta</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. dactylon</emphasis> were found at site 4, suggesting that these species are especially suitable for the area and dominate the site\u2019s vegetation structure. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. dactylon</emphasis> is a resilient grass species typically found in disturbed habitats57. The Dape Sharif site presented the highest density of, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A. nilotica</emphasis> underscoring its prevalence in semiarid environments where it plays crucial ecological roles, including soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A. mutica</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">F. carica</emphasis> presented the lowest density and cover, likely as a result of adverse conditions such as intense competition or nutrient constraints58. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D. viscosa</emphasis> consistently occurs at a high frequency, reinforcing its extensive distribution and ability to thrive in various environments.</p><p>The identified patterns in density and frequency, underscore the ecological prominence of specific species, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. dactylon</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D. viscosa</emphasis>, which consistently presented elevated values across different sites. The resilience of these species enables them to thrive across diverse ecological conditions, highlighting their significance for ecosystem services, including erosion control, support for biodiversity, and habitat restoration59. Moreover, species such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. reflexa</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. montanus</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. auriculata</emphasis> consistently presented low values for these parameters, suggesting that they may not be optimally suited to the existing environmental conditions46,56. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. distichum</emphasis> ultimately surfaced as a species characterized by significant density, and frequency, underscoring its ecological significance. This species exhibited a remarkable tolerance to waterlogged conditions and has a strong capacity to flourish in disturbed environments60.</p><p>The process of carbon sequestration involves the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by plants, which is then stored in their biomass. This mechanism is vital in the fight against climate change, as it effectively decreases the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Tariq et al.61 reported that various plant species have different abilities, for carbon storage, which are influenced by factors such as growth rates, root depth, and biomass accumulation. The findings of this study reveal these differences across multiple sites in the region.</p><p>Compared with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> A. lebbeck</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> B. papillosa</emphasis> presented lower carbon concentrations in its biomass <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">at</emphasis> the Khoora site. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> A. lebbeck</emphasis> is recognized for its ability to fix nitrogen, grow quickly, and generate substantial biomass, positioning it as a strong candidate for carbon sequestration62. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> B. papillosa</emphasis> is characterized by its slower growth rate and limited biomass accumulation, leading to reduced carbon sequestration rates. This underscores the importance of choosing plant species that not only flourish in the local ecosystem but also possess the ability to accumulate substantial biomass63. The species <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. cineraria</emphasis> demonstrated the greatest level of carbon sequestration at both the Dape Sharif and Anga sites.</p><p>The highest level of carbon sequestration was demonstrated by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M. indica</emphasis> in the Knotti Garden location. The Jallar site presented the highest level of carbon sequestration in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. glandulosa</emphasis>, which is also part of the Prosopis genus. Like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. cineraria</emphasis>, this species possesses a strong root system that enables it to flourish in dry environments and sequester considerable quantities of carbon within its woody biomass64. This herbaceous plant has a shorter lifespan and limited biomass accumulation, rendering it less effective at storing carbon65. The findings of this study indicate that the potential for carbon sequestration among different plant species varies significantly on the basis of their growth traits, biomass output, and ability to adapt to local environmental factors.</p><p>Soil erosion, defined as the removal of the topsoil layer through wind, water, or human activities, presents a significant environmental issue. This process contributes to land degradation and a decline in soil fertility, both of which are critical for supporting plant growth66. The most successful plant at lowering soil erosion at Khabeki study site 1 was <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A. modesta</emphasis>. This plant thrives in arid and semiarid regions and is known for its deep and wide root system, which stabilizes soil particles and significantly reduces the effects of wind and water erosion63.</p><p>Khoora study site 2 presented <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A. nilotica</emphasis> which had the most significant capacity to mitigate soil erosion. This tree has significant efficacy in soil stabilization because of its deep taproot and dense canopy, which safeguard the soil against the erosive impacts of wind and water64. At Dape Sharif study site 3, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T. undulata</emphasis> demonstrated the highest efficacy in mitigating soil erosion. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T. undulata</emphasis> plays a significant role in reforestation initiatives within arid areas, addressing issues of desertification and soil erosion. At Anga study site 4, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. cineraria</emphasis> emerged as the leading species in mitigating soil erosion. This species, commonly referred to as the Ghaf tree, remarkably adapts to arid environments, thereby preventing both water and wind erosion67.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>The present investigation delves into the floristic composition, phytosociological attributes, and physicochemical characteristics of soil across six unique ecotypes, namely, Khabeki S1, Khoora S2, Dape Sharif S3, Anga S4, Knotti garden S5, and Jallar S6, which are located in the Soon Valley. The results revealed unique phytosociological patterns and variations in soil properties. This study quantified ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and soil erosion prevention, highlighting the importance of these ecotypes in maintaining ecological balance and supporting local livelihoods. Research has emphasized the need for conservation and sustainable management of these ecosystems, integrating ecological evaluations with socioeconomic factors to ensure the continued delivery of vital ecological services (MEA, 2005; IPBES, 2019). By adopting a comprehensive approach, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interconnections within these ecosystems, underscoring the imperative of conservation to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors extended their appreciation to the Dean ship of Research and Graduate Studies at King Khalid University for the funding this work through Large Research Project under grant number RGP2/204/46.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Stoycheva, V. &amp; Geneletti, D.

Foundational to strategic risk analysis is spatial information on the likelihood of burning in a fire year, typically provided by burn probability (BP) models. The recency of BP maps is a key driver of their accuracy, especially in disturbed landscapes that have experienced changes in fire spread potential. Few published examples exist comparing BP values against subsequent fire activity, and none to our knowledge evaluate annually updated BP maps. Here, we present a novel performance evaluation of the operational wildfire simulation system FSim, confronting updated BP maps with subsequent fire activity across the state of California over a 4-year period (2020\u20132023). Results show strong predictive ability: across 5 equal-area BP classes, 56.7\u201379.8% of the burned area occurred in the top 20% of mapped area; mean (median) BP values in burned areas were 238.5\u2013348.8% (551.4\u2013880.7%) greater than in unburned areas; differences in empirical cumulative distribution functions of BP for burned/unburned areas were statistically significant; Logarithmic Skill Scores ranged from \u2212 0.072 to 0.389 against two reference models. Findings indicate reliable forecast performance and useful application of up-to-date BP maps, critical to support ongoing wildfire risk mitigation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>In the US, the risks and complexities of wildfire have magnified dramatically, with changing socioecological fire regimes, expanding development in fire-prone areas, faster rates of fire growth, more destructive impacts to communities and landscapes, and escalating costs1, 2, 3, 4\u20135. This is consistent with global patterns of environmental change and human activity that are interacting to increase likelihood of extreme wildfire events with grave implications for ecosystem services and public health6, 7, 8\u20139. Continued reliance on wildfire suppression as the dominant management action may exacerbate future hazard while increasing strains on an incident response system already challenged by increasing synchronous fire danger and resource scarcity10, 11, 12\u201313. Hence growing recognition of the need for more proactive approaches to wildfire management as well as risk and decision analytic frameworks to support them14, 15, 16, 17\u201318.</p><p>A foundational need for proactive risk management is information on the likelihood of experiencing wildfire in any given location over a given time horizon. Likelihood can vary by orders of magnitude across landscapes and is therefore a significant driver of hazard and exposure as well as prioritization and efficacy19. Emergency managers, ignition prevention programs, hazardous fuels reduction programs, community hardening programs, land use planners, water and power utilities, and insurance providers, among others, all need reliable information on wildfire likelihood.</p><p>This information is typically provided through burn probability (BP) modeling, now widely used for operational and research purposes20, 21, 22\u201323. BP models differ by the intended application. Generally, all share the same workflow of iteratively simulating fire spread across landscapes while accounting for variability in factors such as ignition patterns and weather. Developing gridded BP datasets involves simulating multiple fire events under a range of conditions and calculating BP values as the number of times a given cell burns divided by the number of simulations. Some models are intended for near real-time incident support24, where ignitions are known, and generate conditional BPs corresponding to patterns of potential fire spread under forecasted weather over a defined planning horizon. Some models capture uncertainty in both ignition location and weather, and generate conditional BPs given user-defined scenarios25. Some models also account for uncertainty in ignition likelihood and generate annualized BPs that probabilistically simulate ignition location and timing as inputs into fire spread simulations26.</p><p>BP modeling is deployed extensively in the US for a range of decision support applications and products, particularly for land management agencies like the USDA Forest Service27, 28, 29, 30\u201331. Our focus here is on FSim, a comprehensive large fire simulation system that generates tens of thousands of synthetic fire years and models fire occurrence and spread while accounting for stochasticity in ignitions, weather, and spotting26. One of its primary outputs is spatially gridded data of annualized BP values (120\u2013270 m) that reflect average large fire potential based on input landscape conditions. Updating fuel conditions to account for large disturbance, as is done annually here, is intended to reflect dynamic spatial patterns of fire likelihood.</p><p>Although these results can be used to estimate expected annual area burned\u2014as the sum-product of all burnable pixels and their corresponding BP values\u2014this is not our primary focus as it does not directly lead to targeted, localized intervention; rather our focus is on FSim\u2019s ability to spatially discriminate wildfire likelihood. We focus on FSim because its results have been integrated into multiple strategic assessment and planning efforts and informed budgetary allocations on the scale of billions. Notable nationwide examples leveraging FSim outputs include the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy27, the Wildfire Crisis Strategy32, the Wildfire Risk to Communities project33, and the FEMA National Risk Index34. FSim results have also been widely deployed to support localized fuels management and operational response strategies35, 36\u201337.</p><p>Despite growing use and sophistication of BP models, the wildfire science community has not widely adopted probabilistic forecast verification as a common practice. Few published examples exist comparing BP values against subsequent fire activity38, 39, 40\u201341. There are many challenges to measuring predictive accuracy of BP models, including insufficient or inaccurate fire observation data, very low BP values in some locations (i.e., &lt; 1 in 1,000), limited ability to model how suppression alters large fire spread patterns, and, critically, changing landscape conditions29,42,43.</p><p>For spatially discriminating areas more or less likely to burn to support targeted intervention, accurately reflecting dynamic landscape conditions is essential. A longer post-simulation evaluation period enables better capture of interannual variability in fire activity, but the original BP map becomes increasingly outdated the longer the evaluation period extends. By contrast, more frequently updating BP maps enables better capture of interannual variability in the landscape\u2019s ability to support or inhibit large fire growth, particularly salient in recently disturbed areas where prior fire activity can lead to self-limiting behavior44.</p><p>Recent work evaluating the performance of FSim BP maps across the conterminous US\u2014based on a static 2014 landscape and contrasted against observed wildfires from 2016 to 2022\u2014reported a moderate correlation of mean BP with observed burned area but underprediction of burned areas in some regions40. The authors suggest that discrepancies may have stemmed from an outdated fuels layer and argued that frequent updates to BP maps could improve their usefulness. Here, motivated in part by these recent findings, we present a novel performance evaluation of FSim, confronting annually updated BP maps with subsequent fire activity across the state of California over a 4-year period (2020\u20132023).</p><p>California presents a compelling and challenging use case\u2014it contains diverse landscapes with high fuel loads influenced by fire exclusion and tree mortality and evolving fire regimes driven by human ignitions and extreme wind events, and has significant attention and need to proactively address growing wildfire risks45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53\u201354. California can also have significant interannual variability in wildfire activity. In 2020, the state set historical records for total area burned and in 2021 experienced the largest single fire in state history (the Dixie Fire), with significant impacts to communities and landscapes15,55, 56\u201357. The fire years of 2022 and 2023 by contrast burned only ~ 10% of the amount burned in 2020 and 2021.</p><p>Our analysis is built on four pairwise comparisons of annual BP and fire activity, with each subsequent BP map updated in response to the prior year\u2019s disturbances. Informed by prior work, we examine how the observed area burned varies with BP values, compare distributions of BP values inside and outside of observed burned areas, and calculate logarithmic skill scores39,40,58. We establish performance benchmarks based on percentiles of observed area burned and BP area mapped, discuss interpretations and risk management implications, and offer future directions in probabilistic forecast verification for wildfire modeling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Observed area burned and burn probabilities</emphasis></p><p>Maps of simulated BP values (Fig. 1) reveal areas of higher fire likelihood throughout the Sierra Nevada, Northern and Southern Coast Ranges, Klamath Mountains, Transverse Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges, with lower likelihood in the Central Valley and Mojave Desert areas. Overlaid observed fire perimeters generally align with hotspots of high BP, particularly in the Northern Coast Range and Klamath Mountains. Interannual variability in spatial patterns of BP is evident in the wake of significant wildfires, particularly notable in the northwest portion of the state with widespread reductions in BP after the 2020 and 2021 fire years (Fig. 2). Within areas burned in 2020, the pre-burn mean BP was 0.054, reduced to 0.024 post-burn, a 56.19% reduction (median BP was reduced by 66.23%). Within areas burned in 2021, the pre-burn mean BP was 0.058, reduced to 0.018, a 69.2% reduction (median BP was reduced by 73.32%).Fig. 1</p><p>Burn probability values and observed fire perimeters.

BP class definitions vary by year; exact delineations of the BP bins are provided in supplementary materials. The general interpretation is that the model effectively predicts that most area burns in the higher BP classes, with slightly more area burned in the Medium and Low-Medium than predicted. The proportion of oAB in the Med-High or High BP classes was 90.3% in 2020, 80.9% in 2021, 93.6% in 2022, and 65.7% in 2023, notably higher than the ~ 40% that would result if area burned followed a random distribution across equal-area BP classes. Predicted proportions of eAB for the Med-High and High BP classes closely matched oAB values (90.1%, 89.7%, 89.7%, and 89.6%), except for 2023 where less area burned in the Med-High and more burned in the Med BP classes. The High BP class alone accounted for 69.2%, 56.8%, 79.8%, and 56.7% of oAB across respective years, varying from eAB (67.1%, 66.4%, 66.4%, and 66.4%). The mean observed area burned for all 4 years in the High BP class was similar to the expected area burned (65.6% vs 66.6%). The proportion of observed area burned in the Low and Low-Med classes was 2.3%, 5.8%, 3.4%, and 9.1% across respective years. These values are greater than expected area burned (2.1%, 2.2%, 2.3%, and 2.3%). The mean observed area burned of all 4 years in Low and Low-Med classes exceeded expected area burned (5.1% vs 2.2%).Fig. 3</p><p>Proportional comparison of expected area burned (eAB) and observed area burned (oAB) across five equal area BP classes. BP class definitions vary by year; exact delineations of the BP bins are provided in supplementary materials.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burn probabilities inside and outside of burned areas</emphasis></p><p>Mean and median BP values were greater within burned areas than outside (Fig. 4). While distributions of BP values inside burned areas showed variability across years, BP values outside of burned areas were consistently concentrated near zero. In 2020, mean BP values in burned areas were 348.78% greater than unburned and median BP values in burned areas were 880.67% greater. In 2021, mean BP values in burned areas were 292.43% greater than unburned and median BP values in burned areas were 551.44% greater. In 2022, mean BP values in burned areas were 271.70% greater than unburned and median BP values in burned areas were 664.66% greater. In 2023, mean BP values in burned areas were 238.53% greater than unburned and median BP values in burned areas were 599.16% greater.Fig. 4</p><p>Violin plots comparing the distribution of burn probability values for burned and unburned areas.

Panels (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) correspond to years 2020\u20132023, respectively.</p><p>Cumulative distribution plots comparing BP values for burned and unburned areas confirm consistent patterns across years of higher BPs in burned areas (Fig. 5). Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests on a 0.01% random sample of burned/unburned areas yielded statistically significant differences for all 4 years (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01) with test statistic values of 0.5447 (2020), 0.4248 (2021), 0.6136 (2022), and 0.3738 (2023). In 2020, 95% of burned area occurred at or above the 50th percentile of BP values and 51% occurred above the 90th percentile. In 2021, 88% of burned area occurred at or above the 50th percentile and 33% above the 90th percentile. In 2022, 96% of burned area occurred above the 50th percentile and 38% above the 90th percentile. In 2023, 74% of burned area occurred above the 50th percentile and 36% above the 90th percentile.Fig. 5</p><p>Cumulative distribution plots comparing burn probability values in burned versus unburned areas. Panels (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) correspond to years 2020\u20132023, respectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Logarithmic skill scores</emphasis></p><p>Logarithmic Skill Scores (LSS; 58) were computed to provide a quantitative measure of forecast quality using two different reference logarithmic scores as the baselines for deriving the skill score, two different sets of data (burned only and all cells), and across all four years totaling 16 LSS estimates (Table 1). Mean LSS were 0.276 and 0.339 from 2020 to 2023 for burned cells using the naive reference model and the resampled reference model, respectively, which can be interpreted as the percentage improvements over these reference models. The LSS drops when both burned and unburned cells are considered with means of 0.114 and 0.280 against the naive and resampled reference models, respectively (Table 1). The decrease can largely be attributed to two years of negative skill in 2022 and 2023 for the all-cells LSS.

LSS improved in five of the six comparisons by a mean of 0.028 (42%)\u2013indicating superior performance of up-to-date BP maps relative to the continued use of the 2020 BP predictions for multiple years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Results generally showed strong predictive performance of annual BP maps as evaluated through multiple comparisons: markedly greater proportions of burned areas in higher BP bins; higher mean and median BPs in burned than unburned areas; statistically significant differences in cumulative distributions of BP between burned areas and unburned areas; and Logarithmic Skill Scores (LSS) for BP maps indicating outperformance of reference models. A general performance benchmark of observing 57\u201380% of area burned in the top ~ 20% of mapped BP area was established.</p><p>In addition to the general performance benchmark, the importance of interannual updates was evident. The largest cause of year-to-year model differences were from previous year disturbances represented in the fuel inputs, the most impactful of those being wildfire scars. We observed a mean percent reduction in BP of 69% in the following years (2021\u20132023) within the wildfire perimeters occurring in the study time frame (2020\u20132022). The model represented beyond -perimeter effects with a mean percent reduction in BP of 15% in a 2 km buffer from these wildfires. The BP maps responded on a landscape-level as well with total mean reductions in BP of 10% and 7% following the large fire years of 2020 and 2021, respectively, and only a 1% reduction in BP following the mild fire year in 2022. The average improvement of 42% in the LSS using updated inputs over relying on the increasingly-outdated 2020 BP map also highlights the added value of interannual updating.</p><p>Some relevant prior work evaluates the performance of conditional BP maps generated for individual wildfire events with known ignition locations, which significantly shrinks the uncertainty relative to simulating thousands of potential fire years and millions of potential events. Paz et al.41 established a similar performance benchmark for a single wildfire, reporting that 87% of observed burned area occurred in the top 30% of mapped BP area, which is within the range of results we present. Allaire et al.38 calculated Brier Skill Scores against a posteriori reference models based on the final footprints of seven observed fires. Although not directly comparable, our LSS were within the ranges they present (\u2212 9.986\u20140.352) and generally closer to their best performing ensemble.</p><p>In two cases our LSS were negative\u2014for low fire activity years (2022\u20132023) and when considering BP forecasts for all cells (not just burned cells) using the 15-year mean BP reference. This is largely due to the large number of higher BP predictions with a relatively low level of positive cases (burned cells). For these years, the analysis still shows model skill in all three analyses. For burned cells only, the LSS was generally similar to other years. The spatially randomized BP reference model intended on evaluating the spatial skill alone given the exact same distribution of BP was present and the corresponding LSS were 0.246 for 2022 and 0.191 for 2023. This highlights the difficulty in predicting burn probability in systems that can exhibit dramatic interannual variability (e.g., ~ 10% of area burned in 2022 and 2023 relative to 2020 and 2021). Analysis on BP modeling skill scores could be expanded to explore how they vary with fire activity or alternative reference models.</p><p>More directly relevant work includes evaluation of landscape- scale BP maps across larger regions with multiple years of fire observations, but without annual updates to fuels after disturbance. Evaluating simulation modeling in Alberta, Canada, Beverly and McLaughlin39 reported that distributions of BP in burned areas were not heavily skewed towards higher BP values, but that most of the burned area (75\u201380%) occurred in the top 50th percentile of mapped BP. Evaluating simulation modeling for the conterminous US, Carlson et al.40 established that 68% of the observed burned area occurred in the top 40% of mapped BP area, and for Mediterranean California that 62% of observed area burned occurred in the top 40% of mapped BP area. The performance benchmark discrepancy between40 and that established here could be attributed to several factors, including using more up-to-date and customized fuel input layers, more recent historical fire weather and occurrence data, differences and improvements in modeling methods and calibration over time, or simply narrowing the scope of analysis to a more fire prone region. The present analysis encompasses landscape scale evaluation of BP maps over multiple years while resolving issues of large disturbance effects through annual updates and generally indicates the strongest BP modeling performance published to date.</p><p>Several extensions and improvements are apparent. First, researchers could pursue validation across different geographic areas and across longer time horizons, especially in areas with comparatively less frequent fire activity, or for different BP systems used in operational decision support27,59. Second, validation could be performed on other FSim model outputs such as perimeters, fire progression maps, or magnitude of daily spread events60, 61, 62\u201363. Other efforts could focus on continued model improvement. For example, better information on fuel break and suppression effectiveness could improve containment modeling48,64,65. While temporal trends in fire occurrence were utilized in calibration, the reliance on historical data results in climate change not being directly considered and previous work has developed approaches for its incorporation in more out-year probability estimates66.</p><p>It is likely that application of machine learning-based approaches for BP prediction will increase67, 68, 69\u201370, highlighting a need for comparative validation and use case exploration. Costa-Saura et al.71 contrasted BP interpretations from fire spread and random forest models and noted that firefighting decision making might be more tightly linked with fire spread information. Applications of process-based fire spread simulation will persist, particularly for accompanying analyses based on the underlying simulated perimeters to analyze transmission into communities or watershed impacts14,72. This highlights the broader needs of accounting for user needs and experience with using risk-based information for decision support31,73.</p><p>In summary, the primary implication is that managers can have confidence in using well-calibrated BP maps to support ongoing wildfire risk assessment and planning in California and other fire prone regions, while sharing the sentiments expressed in Beverly and McLaughlin39 and Carlson et al.40 that caution is warranted. In fact, with growing wildfire activity and more communities at risk the use of BP modeling will likely increase, and rigorous evaluation of these predictions will increase confidence when prioritizing resources for prevention and mitigation. We hope this effort can catalyze broader collaborative efforts in probabilistic wildfire forecast verification with FSim and other BP models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>We generated annual burn probability (BP) maps for each year from 2020 to 2023 using a customized version of the Large Fire Simulation Model (FSim; version 1.0.9) in projects for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. FSim is a stochastic , iterative model that simulates plausible fire ignition, growth, intensity, suppression, and containment throughout hypothetical years26,74. FSIM is developed by the United States Forest Service Missoula Fire Science Laboratory utilizing the foundational surface spread model75, crown fire spread and initiation models76,77 and methods for their spatially-explicit application78,79. Each iteration in the model represents an entire year and given enough iterations is intended to capture the full range of potential outcomes for a given set of inputs along with estimates of central tendency and variability.</p><p>Simulations were performed individually for unique pyromes, i.e., areas of relatively homogenous contemporary vegetation, climate, and fire regimes built to support landscape fire simulation80. Each pyrome was an individual modeling domain with unique calibration parameters and a 30 km buffer to allow ignitions to spread outside pyrome boundaries preventing edge effects. The BP estimates from each domain were then mosaicked by summing the overlapping buffer areas after normalizing by iteration count, which were a minimum of 10,000 per domain. Input parameters and outputs were reviewed in 2020 by fire experts in California and calibrated against historical fire occurrence data using best practices81. Input data were updated annually in response to observed disturbances based on fire observation and fuel treatment data and expert-defined fuel calibration rulesets that follow the general framework developed in the LANDFIRE program82. Calibration targets for fire size and occurrence distributions were developed using ordinary least squares regression over the prior 15 years of fire activity; more details on calibration are available in29.</p><p>We use a historical fire perimeters package to determine whether an area was burned by a fire in our given time frame (2020\u20132023). To create this package, we merged Welty and Jeffries83 perimeters with National Intergency Fire Center perimeters and clipped fires that burned only partially within California to the California boundary. We filtered the resulting geometries for large fires (&gt; 100 acres) and turned them into binary rasters at a 30 m resolution. We excluded non-burnable land cover from the analysis as defined by LANDFIRE.gov, except where BP was greater than zero to retain urban and agricultural areas classified as burnable following methods in the Wildfire Risk to Communities project84. This method of ignoring non-burnable features such as water, barren, rock, and ice ensured that we did not give our BP models credit for predicting that non-burnable features would not burn.</p><p>We employ three methods to evaluate BP modeling performance results against subsequent annual fire activity. First, we compare the proportional values of expected area burned (eAB) and observed area burned (oAB) across five equal-area BP bins. To quantify eAB, we multiply the total land area mapped in each BP bin by the mean BP of that bin. Second, we compare mean and median BP values within and outside of burned areas using violin plots and compare cumulative distribution functions of burned and unburned areas by BP with Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests85.</p><p>Third, we calculate logarithmic scores (LS; 58) and derive logarithmic skill scores (LSS) using two reference models: one based on the previous fire activity produced by calculating the constant BP value that would generate the expected area burned that matched the latest 15-year mean area burned (2006\u20132020) in the Fire Occurrence Database86, and another based on spatially randomizing the predicted BP values across the entire domain. The former represents a standard, naive reference analogous to a climatological average in weather forecasting skill scoring and the latter a reference isolating the spatial skill by having the same distribution of BP values across the study area. We iteratively tested the variability in LSS following BP spatial randomization and found minimal variation in the LSS values. The LS followed the binary formulation as follows:1where  is the probability at cell  and  is the binary outcome burned (1) or not burned (0), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> is the number of cells. The LSS is then:2where  is either the 15-year mean BP or the spatially randomized mean BP models. LSS are chosen over the ubiquitous Brier Skill scores (e.g., 38) to account for the rarity of wildfire occurrence, a known limitation58.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We\u2019re grateful for the insight and help of staff from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the USDA Forest Service to develop these products.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Balch, JK.

(AP) \u2014 Firefighters in New Jersey are reporting \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in battling a wildfire that is threatening dozens of structures, one of a number of forest fires they are fighting in the state.</p><p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Forest Fire Service said Saturday afternoon that the fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County had been 50% contained.</p><p>The blaze is burning over 162 acres (65 hectares) and is threatening 55 structures, although no evacuations have been ordered. The blaze earlier prompted closure of the right lane of northbound Interstate 287, officials said.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service was battling the blaze with fire engines and ground crews and a helicopter capable of dropping 350 gallons (1,325 liters) of water, officials said. Structures were being protected by local fire companies, they said.</p><p>Officials also reported Saturday afternoon fighting a new wildfire that has ignited across more than 1,800 acres (728 hectares) near the New York-New Jersey border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, New York. The Jennings Creek wildfire was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long Pond Ironworks Historic District.</p><p>An earlier wildfire in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships was reported 90% contained.</p><p>A blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York, was reported 40% contained.</p><p>Firefighters reported 75% containment of the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County.</p><p>Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of \u201cincendiary or tracer ammunition\u201d was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.</p><p>The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning in parts of New Jersey, saying gusty winds and low humidity could help spread fires quickly.</p><p>New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month, the weather service said, setting a new record.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-e026f64360226079eec1a816717cc59720241109</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DCM-2MK1-DYMD-60YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The study, which modeled cholera transmission after interventions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), highlights how long-term strategies like improving access to clean water and sanitary infrastructure could be particularly effective in locations where cholera is endemic due to the contribution of an environmental reservoir.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A paper describing the research, led by researchers at Penn State, was published in the journalPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p><p>\"When conducting interventions for an infectious disease, public health officials must decide how to allocate resources and prioritize strategies that will have the most impact,\" said Alexandre Blake, first author of the paper, who completed the work when he was a postdoctoral researcher in biology in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics (CIDD). \"We are particularly interested in how to allocate resources in endemic situations. If an epidemic is like a forest fire, with transmission burning intensely before coming to a stop, then an endemic disease is more like a slow burn, with transmission constantly in the background with occasional flare ups. We used statistical modeling to better understand cholera transmission in the city of Kalemie in the DRC, where it is endemic. We specifically focused on the two years following a series of interventions to evaluate the impact of those interventions.\"</p><p>Cholera is a bacterial disease that can be transmitted when the bacteria are ingested. The disease can cause severe diarrhea, which can potentially contaminate water sources with the disease-causing bacteria and lead to increased transmission, especially in areas with poor sanitation or limited infrastructure to treat drinking water. Although many people who become infected have no symptoms or mild symptoms, symptomatic cases of cholera can progress quickly, leading to severe dehydration that can be fatal. One study estimated that 1.3 million to 4 million cholera cases worldwide cause between 21,000 and 143,000 deaths each year. The Global Task Force on Cholera Control has created a road map to eliminate cholera in 20 countries by 2030, particularly targeting sub-Saharan Africa, where cholera has been endemic since the early 1970s.</p><p>Interventions for cholera often include vaccination, which can be rapidly implemented, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene improvements, collectively called WASH. Large scale WASH strategies, such as improving infrastructure for sanitation and access to clean water, are more expensive and take months to years to implement.</p><p>\"We know that WASH and vaccination are great tools to prevent cholera,\" Blake said. \"But the impact of vaccination has largely been studied in epidemic situations as a rapid response. WASH is slow and costly to implement which makes it hard to accomplish in low-income settings. To eliminate cholera, we need to better understand the many factors that drive transmission as well as the impact of different interventions in endemic settings.\"</p><p>From late 2013 to early 2016, Doctors Without Borders led intervention efforts in Kalemie, including vaccination and WASH efforts. WASH efforts focused on improving access to clean water, for example by installing pipes, water reservoirs and public drinking fountains, as well as distributing water filters and, during outbreaks, chlorinating drinking water to kill bacteria.</p><p>The researchers built several statistical models to determine which combination of factors best explained cholera transmission during this period. They used satellite images of light at night to track seasonal occupancy of the city, which impacts the number of people in the area capable of becoming infected with or transmitting the bacteria. They also included rainfall and other environmental variables that might impact the bacteria's ability to survive in the nearby lake and infect more people.</p><p>Although the researchers did not find much impact of the seasonal movement of people in Kalemie, they did find that a large portion of transmission resulted from the environment, likely because the lake acts as a reservoir for the cholera bacteria.</p><p>\"Because the bacteria persist in the lake, some residents of the city may have opportunities to be regularly exposed and may ultimately develop some level of immunity, which shapes transmission dynamics and eventually the impact of some interventions,\" Blake said.</p><p>The researchers estimated that most of the cholera transmission could be avoided if environmental exposure or contamination was prevented. The researchers also estimated that the majority of residents had some immunity during this period due to regular outbreaks and persistent exposure in the environment. Taken together, the researchers said that vaccination would have a smaller impact on preventing transmission compared to WASH in such settings.</p><p>Blake said that early in epidemic situations, most people in the area are assumed not to be immune to the disease, so fast-paced responses like vaccination can be a good choice for management - but endemic infections require a more comprehensive approach.</p><p>\"In an epidemic setting, it's almost never a wrong decision to vaccinate because the majority of the population is susceptible to the disease, so vaccinating early in the outbreak can quickly increase immunity levels,\" he said. \"But in endemic settings, this assumption may not be true. Vaccines are ideal for people who do not already have some level of protection from previous exposure, but testing to see if an individual is already immune can be costly or impractical. So, in areas like Kalemie where there may be relatively high levels of immunity due to environmental transmission, we estimate a higher proportion of cases can be avoided from long-term strategies like WASH if both strategies are competing because of limited resources.\"</p><p>An additional benefit of WASH, Blake said, is its positive impact on general health.</p><p>\"Whether it's talking to people on the street about hygiene or improving sanitation and access to clean water, WASH provides basic needs and can reduce transmission of more than just cholera,\" he said. \"WASH efforts have greater up-front costs but have long-lasting impacts.\"</p><p>Blake noted that studies to confirm the level of immunity in Kalemie and other endemic areas are needed. Ultimately, he said, this information could be used to refine intervention strategies targeting endemic diseases that have an environmental reservoir that contributes to transmission.</p><p>\"Vaccination and WASH efforts are both critical tools in controlling the spread of diseases like cholera,\" said Nita Bharti, associate professor of biology, who is also affiliated with CIDD at Penn State and senior author of the paper. \"But a 'one size fits all' approach is not going to work across epidemic and endemic situations. We need a location-specific understanding of the role of the environment and transmission routes to control cholera and other infectious diseases in endemic areas.\"</p><p>In addition to Blake and Bharti, the research team at Penn State includes Adam Walder, who has since graduated with a doctoral degree in statistics, and Ephraim Hanks, associate professor of statistics, both affiliated with CIDD. The team also includes Placide Okitayemba Welo at Programme National d'Elimination du Cholera et de lutte contre les autres Maladies Diarrheiques in the DRC; Francisco Luquero at Epicentre in France; and Didier Bompangue at the University of Kinshasa in the DRC.</p><p>Funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Science Foundation, and the U.S. National Institute of Food and Agriculture supported this research.

It is particularly important today as the frequency and severity of wildfires continues to rise, increasingly threatening the health and safety of communities.</p><p>\"By improving our wildfire knowledge, mitigation and response strategies, we can help reduce the impact of wildfires on our homes, communities, and economies,\" says the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. \"The federal government is providing funding to academia, not-for-profits, community leaders, and governments to advance wildfire knowledge and strengthen wildfire preparedness and risk reduction efforts across the country ahead of the 2025 wildfire season.\"</p><p>Although individual residents in fire-prone areas can take various measures to protect their own properties, many come up against significant obstacles, including monetary and physical demands of the tasks. Replacing a roof or making changes to structural elements of a home or building is prohibitively expensive to many, even though the measures can have a really big impact.</p><p>\"It's critically important to ensure that we explore and seize every opportunity to prevent fires throughout our communities. I am very pleased to see continued funding being directed towards the project led by York University, as it demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding lives, property, and the environment. Working together at all levels, is key to creating effective and sustainable fire prevention strategies,\" says the Honourable Judy Sgro, Member of Parliament for Humber River-Black Creek.</p><p>That's where local governments have a large role to play to ensure their entire communities, towns and cities are fire ready. \"Things like fire breaks can help intercept forest fires before they arrive at the community and while they're still on public land,\" says Kennedy, interim director of York Emergency Mitigation, Engagement, Response, and Governance Institute (Y-EMERGE). \"We're seeing the embers from one house igniting another house and the embers from that house igniting another house, and this chain effect now largely ceases to be a forest fire or a wildland fire and is instead an urban fire.\"</p><p>He points out there are a bunch of known improvements that local governments can implement to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and families to potentially devastating wildfires.</p><p>Many local governments, however, have not been able to fully take advantage of the resources and funding available. This project will help to determine what supports local governments need to implement wildfire mitigation measures, such as encouraging the construction of more resilient neighbourhoods and building new developments with wider roads.</p><p>\"We are looking at current uptake of residential mitigation by local governments and how to expand it, get people working together on this and ensure programs are designed in a way that makes it as easy as possible for communities and regions, cities and towns to tackle this really urgent problem,\" says Kennedy.</p><p>Fire risk mitigation programs are designed to not only help reduce building ignition and loss but also help prevent the fire from jumping from one home or building to another, which can help save lives and property, while making it safer for firefighters.</p><p>The project will look at the social, political, institutional and resourcing barriers; strategies, programs or interventions to overcome barriers; partnerships with local governments; and best practices for establishing, monitoring and evaluating ongoing relationships.</p><p>The second piece of the project includes creating interventions to improve the uptake of fire mitigation efforts across the country and developing national surveys and case studies to gain further insights.</p><p>\"One of the goals of the project is to share what we're learning, test drive some improvements and hopefully refine those over the course of the project,\" says Kennedy.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yorku.ca/news/2025/03/20/york-university-receives-close-to-400k-from-natural-resources-canada-to-better-understand-planning-needs-of-wildfire-prone-communities/\">https://www.yorku.ca/news/2025/03/20/york-university-receives-close-to-400k-from-natural-resources-canada-to-better-understand-planning-needs-of-wildfire-prone-communities/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9128759 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9128759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCW-G5D3-RS3T-D32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><timeReceived>7:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 21, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires can develop rapidly and may cause a wide range of hazards.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beihang University: \"Therefore, aerial firefighting, which has the ability to respond and reach fire fields quickly, is of great significance to the emergency response to and subsequent extinguishing of forest fires. The burning of forest fires generates a lot of heat and smoke, which changes the air flow environment and vision over the region and brings challenges to aerial firefighting. In the present work, aerial forest firefighting simulation was divided into the forest fire spread model, the air flow model and the aircraft flight dynamic and automatic control model. Each model was constructed based on a physical method.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"An integrated framework was designed to realize the interaction among fire fields, airfields, and aircraft, and is verified. The proposed framework can be used for the emergency response decision of aerial forest fire fighting and subsequent fire-fighting mission planning.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Flight Simulation of Fire-Fighting Aircraft Based on Multi-Factor Coupling Modeling of Forest Fire.

According to news reporting from Karnataka, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fires pose a significant ecological and environmental threat globally, and India has seen a marked increase in both the frequency and severity of these events in recent years. This has led to extensive damage to natural resources, including forests and wildlife habitats.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the Indian Institute of Science, \"Effective management strategies are essential to mitigate these impacts, and this study aims to contribute to that effort through spatial prediction of forest fires in India using machine learning techniques. The research begins by analyzing spatial patterns and trends of forest fires and identifying key factors contributing to their occurrence. It then explores the relationships between forest fires and these factors. Using data from 2001 to 2020, the study develops a probability map of forest fire occurrences in India, leveraging data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on fire points and burned areas and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) land use land cover. The analysis incorporates various fire occurrence conditioning factors, including climate variables (precipitation, air temperature, specific humidity, near-surface wind speed, net longwave radiation, and land surface temperature for both daytime and nighttime), biophysical factors (aspect, slope, elevation, soil moisture, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and other factors such as proximity to railways, roads, and waterways. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) was employed to identify these factors and generate the probability map. The results indicate that forest fires are predominantly concentrated in three major regions: Northeast India, Uttarakhand-Himachal, and the Deccan Plateau. The study also highlights the link between forest fires and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, and 15). The findings can inform the identification of vulnerable areas, enabling the implementation of preventative measures.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research is crucial as it not only pinpoints regions at risk of forest fires but also elucidates their impacts on the environment and local livelihoods, thereby enhancing risk assessment and early warning systems.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatial prediction of forest fires in India: a machine learning approach for improved risk assessment and early warning systems.
