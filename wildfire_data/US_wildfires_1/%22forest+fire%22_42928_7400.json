My name is Elaine, and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vermilion Energy Q3 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Jean Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER, CEO: Well, thank you, Elaine. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars lemster, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerman, Vice President, International HSE Race Kremke, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President of Investor Relations.</p><p>We will be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss the Q3 2022 results. presentation can be found on our website under Invest with Us and Events and Presentations. Please refer to our advisory and forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes the forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today and outline the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on Slide 2, we generated $508 million of fund flow in Q3. which is a 12% increase over the prior quarter and is another quarterly record for Vermilion. For perspective, this quarterly fund flow is more than we generated for the full year of 2020. Free cash flow of $324 million was down slightly from the previous quarter due to higher capital expenditures associated with our Australia drilling program, which we successfully completed during the quarter. Majority of Q3 free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction.</p><p>Our net debt decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion, representing a debt to trailing 12-month fund flow ratio of 0.8x. As we outlined last quarter, with our formal return of capital framework is our intention to return more free cash flow to our shareholders as debt decreases. In Q3, we paid a cash dividend of CAD 0.08 per share and repurchased 2.3 million shares under our NCIB for $72 million. Combined, this amounts to $85 million returned to our shareholders, representing 26% of Q3 free cash flow.</p><p>Pro forma Q3 fund flow and free cash flow incorporating the incremental 36.5% ownership in Core was $611 million and $426 million, respectively. Q3 production averaged 84,237 BOEs per day, which was in line with the prior quarter as we previously guided to, reflecting planned turnaround activity in Canada and the forest far related downtime in France, which offset the new production added from the La Crate acquisition, which closed at the end of May.</p><p>As I mentioned on the previous slide, our net debt to trailing fund flow ratio decreased 0.8x. As can be seen on Slide 3, this is our lowest leverage in over 10 years. We have made significant progress on debt reduction in the last 2 years, we intend on maintaining this discipline going forward. We operated with a leverage ratio near 1x or below for 10 straight years from 2003 to 2013. We will target lower leverage going forward. While commodity prices have helped drive this ratio lower, we'll manage our debt targets based on mid-cycle pricing assumptions, which at 1x fund flow implies an absolute debt target of $1 billion or less.</p><p>Contributing to our strong Q3 financial results was a robust European gas prices, which nearly doubled in Q3 compared to the prior quarter. As shown on Slide 4, TTF reached an all-time high of $120 per MMBtu in late August, following various supply disruptions and growing concerns regarding Europe's ability to meet winter energy demand. Energy security and inflation have become focal points for many countries and citizens around the world, especially in Europe. Energy security situation in Europe, which is really the result of policy decisions over multiple years have been amplified by the ongoing and devastating conflict in Ukraine.</p><p>Prior to 2022, Europe relied on Russia for approximately 40% of its gas supply, but Russia imports have significantly decreased in recent months as key infrastructure was taken offline. Damage to the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in the Baltic Sea in late September has removed approximately 6 Bcf of supply capacity, which brings the total supply loss of 10 Bcf per day year-over-year. At this time, it is uncertain if or when this capacity will come back.</p><p>Despite these challenges, Europe managed to source enough gas over the summer months to essentially fill storage ahead of the winter heating season, even with partial Russian gas supply, prices averaged approximately $60 per MMBtu for the injection season period. We will discuss some of the underlying fundamentals driving European gas and outline why we are bullish on this commodity. It is important to understand how Europe was able to fill stories this past year and how the situation may be different next year.</p><p>Chart on Slide 5 illustrates the year-over-year change in LNG imports versus China and the rest of the world. As you can see, over 50% of Europe's increase in LNG imports this year was due to reduced LNG demand in other countries. Global LNG supply did not materially increase, it was rerouted to Europe. European LNG imports were up significantly as Europe started to wean itself off from Russian gas. This is a very large undertaking as Russian gas represent approximately 18 Bcf per day of Europe's gas supply.</p><p>Europe achieved higher LNG imports by outbidding the rest of world for LNG. However, this was also during a period where China had lower demand due to stringent COVID lockdown policies. In addition, Nord Stream One was an operation at supplying Europe for over half of the injection period. Storage essentially full, Europe is expected to have enough gas to meet demand this winter assuming average weather conditions. However, refilling storage capacity next year may prove to be more difficult with Nord Stream 1 presumably offline and Chinese demand potentially returning to pre-COVID levels.</p><p>Europe has become structurally more dependent on LNG imports to meet current natural gas needs. To put it in perspective, the volume of Russian gas that was supplied to Europe before the war represents approximately 1/3 of the world's current LNG supply. Another way to think about it is you would need to more than double the U.S. LNG export capacity to replace the Russian volumes supplied to Europe. The increased LNG demand will require direct competition with Asia, where LNG demand is also expected to increase over the coming decades.</p><p>There's very limited new LNG supply coming online over the next few years. New projects require significant capital underpinned by long-term contracts, which many European countries have been reluctant to commit to. In the recent weeks, the Qatar Energy Minister (inaudible) is the largest supplier of LNG in the world stated that negotiations with the European countries on new LNG supply are challenging due to Europe's unwillingness to commit to long-term contracts, which are typically 15, 20 years. Investments of this scale are expected to structurally change long-term pricing of European gas to higher than what it was before the war.</p><p>Given this global LNG backdrop and the underlying supply and demand fundamentals developing in Europe, we expect LNG and European gas prices to remain elevated. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, European gas was a meaningful contributor to [remains] strong Q3 financial results, and we expect to be a key driver for future results. The chart on the left of Slide 6 shows historical and forward price for TTF, JKM and AECO. The blue bar is Vermillion's average corporate realized price premium to AECO.</p><p>On a pro forma basis, including the core of acquisition volumes, European gas represents about 1/4 of Vermilion's production base and contributes over 40% of our fund flow. Vermillion has approximately 3.8 million net acres of undeveloped land in the prospective basins across Europe. And we believe there is an opportunity to increase gas production with government support and the appropriate regulatory frameworks in place.</p><p>High European gas prices and the prospect for higher energy costs in the years ahead has become a front and center concern of all stakeholders in Europe, including politicians. For the past several months, there have been various government policy ideas debated on how to contain energy prices in Europe, ranging from voluntary demand reduction to price caps to infill taxes. Vermilion has been actively engaged with government officials in the countries where we operate to identify opportunities where we can contribute to domestic gas needs.</p><p>Natural gas is an important energy source that should be produced locally where possible to ensure security of supply. This is consistent that we haven't recognized natural gas as a transition fuel. Late in the third quarter, the European Union announced several proposals in an attempt to address high energy costs. One of the proposals which was subsequently approved the temporary windfall tax measure aimed at EU companies with activities in the hydrocarbon sector. This windfall tax is calculated as a percentage of earnings above a baseline of 120% of the average of taxable earnings with a subject company between 2018 and 2021.</p><p>We have provided an estimate for 2022 windfall tax impact of $250 million to $350 million within our Q3 release. There continues to be many unknown variables related to the final implementation of the tax. However, our current estimate of the potential 2-year exposure for 2022 and 2023 if the tax was implemented as framed by the EU would be approximately $650 million to $750 million, again, over 2 years based on the current strip pricing. This estimate is inclusive of the incremental core working interest.</p><p>As shown on Slide 7, we have updated our 2022 pro forma financial outlook to incorporate this windfall tax and now forecast pro forma fund flow of $2.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion or over $9 per share, which implies a free cash flow yield of in excess of 30%.</p><p>Getting back to our Q3 results, we provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slides 8 through 11. Production from our international operations averaged 27,095 BOEs per day in Q3 and increased 1% from the prior quarter. Production increased in Australia and Germany, which has more than offset far related downtime in France and natural decline in other jurisdictions. Most notable activity in our international operations in Q3 was a successful completion of an offshore drilling program in Australia.</p><p>As highlighted last quarter, this program was scheduled to start earlier in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately 1 month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on the third-party contracted rig. Drilling program was a success and the wells were brought on production in September. In Europe, we focused on restoring production in France that was impacted by the forest fire and expect most of the products to be restored by the end of the year. During the quarter, 3 wells were drilled in Hungary, but none of these wells encounter commercial hydro curves.</p><p>Capital spend on this program was minimum while the findings will further enhance our knowledge and understanding of the geology in this region. Elsewhere in Europe, we continued with support work for our Q4 drilling campaign, which will include 1 well in the Netherlands, 1 well in Germany and 2 wells in Croatia. The Netherlands and German program continues into early 2023 for a total of 6 wells combined.</p><p>As mentioned, we had a very successful drilling campaign in Australia. We drilled the B 17 and B 18 wells for a total of 6,500 meters horizontal well length drilled between the 2 wells. The 360-degree well path with planned sidetracks in the B-17 well resulted in accessing new reserves. The wells that produce over 300,000 barrels [cume] to date, our and crude currently sells at an approximately $14 premium to Brent, resulting in a Q3 Australian operating netback of approximately $96 per BOE.</p><p>At current pricing of these 2 wells have generated approximately $30 million of operating cash flows recovering 40% of the invested capital in the first 2 months on production. As in previous years, we will limit the production of these wells to manage our marketing contracts. We are currently evaluating the results to identify potential new targets and plan for our next drilling campaign, which we expect to occur in 2024 or 2025.</p><p>Production from our North American operations averaged 57,142 Bs per day in Q3, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter primarily due to third-party downtime in Canada, a delayed start-up of our Turner wells in the U.S. In Canada, we ramped up our Southeast Saskatchewan drilling program, we brought on production 14 wells and completed the 6 wells of our first Montney pad at Mika, which were drilled in Q2. In the United States, we completed and brought on production the remaining 5 wells of the 6-well Turner program. 3 of the wells were drilled with the extended reach 2-mile laterals and and we executed lower intensity fracs across the wells, which resulted in approximately $2.7 million of total cost savings.</p><p>While the initial production from these wells is lower than our previous higher intensity completions, we are monitoring performance to determine the impact on longer-term decline profiles, well recovery and overall capital efficiencies. One of our [pharma] partners drilled and completed 2 commitment while testing the Parkman formation. The performance of those wells has exceeded our internal type curves, which we will continue to monitor while accessing the potential of this play on our lands. At River Basin assets, similar to other North American assets, has multiple stack targets including the Parkman, the Naber and the More, which represents significant upside beyond the turn.</p><p>As a reminder, we closed the La Croda acquisition at the end of May and took over operations during the 6-well drilling program that was initiated by the La Croda on the Alberta Lands. We successfully completed the wells executing over 1,000 fracs. While testing was limited due to fire restrictions. However, we are nearing completion of the initial build-out of the facility and are excited to bring the wells on production shortly. We will be kicking off another 3-well pad in Alberta in Q4. Late in the third quarter, we received approval to restart 1 mile well in BC, which is now producing over 1,000 barrels a day for over the last month, which is in line with our expectations.</p><p>We have prepared detailed development plans for both our Alberta and BC lands. Although our preference is focused on the BC development, we will continue to maintain flexibility in terms of infrastructure development across the asset, including a drill-to-fill option on the Alberta lands, utilizing the existing infrastructure, which will result in approximately 7,000 to 8,000 BOEs a day of production in 2023. This option manages our near-term capital by deferring additional Alberta infrastructure and instead building out the BC infrastructure where the majority of our drilling inventory is located.</p><p>As part of our corporate allocation, we are optimistic that we can also increase capital to European gas drilling in 2023. Our 2022 capital budget and production guidance remains unchanged. However, we expect annual production to be at the lower end of the range due to the fire-related downtime in France and delayed downstream timing of the Australia and U.S. wells. Closing of the Core acquisition is nearing the final stages and we now anticipate acquisition to close in Q1 2023 due to administrative delays.</p><p>As previously noted, all free cash flow generated by the acquired interest in core from Jan 1, 2022 until close where accrue to Vermillion will be netted off the final purchase price. We plan to announce our 2023 budget in early January, and as we require additional time to assess the impact of windfall tax, we'll work with our regulators in Europe to facilitate additional drilling and continued timing -- confirmed timing on the core acquisition close. We will remain disciplined in '23 as we continue to focus on debt reduction.</p><p>At this time, we anticipate a capital budget similar to 2022 investment levels with potentially a greater portion allocated to European gas. We have the ability and desire to drill more wells in Europe. And if I'm going to go discussions with regulators are productive, we would look to allocate additional capital to the region in 2023. In particular, we have several large gas prospects in Germany, targets that are approximately 10x larger than our recent Netherlands drills, we have -- we're having a very encouraging dialogue with local and state officials in Germany about the prospect of a [seller] and drilling into late 2023.</p><p>That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Greg Pardy from RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: It's Robert Man on here for Greg Pardy. My first question is just surrounding the Corrib deal. Could you provide some guidance around what the net cost or benefit would be if it closed in the first quarter of 2023. And what the probability of the deal is, if the deal does not close for some reason? And if so, how would the unwind work there?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Okay. Well, thanks, Robert. I'll pass it to Lars just to discuss the financial question and then Darcy to address the timing.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER, CFO: Robert, as Dion mentioned, we have factored in the windfall tax impact of the 36.5% interest on Corrib into our analysis here. As opposed to giving a hard number, what I would guide to is a payout at some point in the second half of 2023, now that we would have to factor in the windfall tax obligation, which we will incorporate into the final purchase price effective Jan 1, 2022.</p><p>So a payout at some point in the second half of 2023. The thing that I would highlight then is that includes the hedges that we put in place as part of the original transaction. As you get into 2024 you would then have all of that European gas benefiting cash flows on an unhedged basis.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Lars. Darcy, do you want to follow up on the second part of the question?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;DARCY KERWIN, SENIOR KEY EXECUTIVE: Yes. As it relates to the timing of the close, we certainly do expect that this deal will close. Originally, we did expect it in close in 2022, and that is still a possibility, but we think it's likely to slip now into Q1 of 2023. All the parties continue to work together to complete this hedges that we put in place as part of the original transaction. We're all working through the administrative delays related to finalizing documents with the government and our partners.</p><p>I think it's worth noting that all cash flows are accruing to our benefit as of January 1, 2022, effective date. So the timing of the close really doesn't impact the financial contributions of the acquisition and kind of put things in perspective, when we last did a deal in Ireland to acquire an additional [10%] stake in quarter, it took approximately 18 months to close. And so we're used to this kind of longer closure period taking place in Europe. So we do expect to fully close in the first quarter.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: That's great. And just switching gears here a little bit, if I can. How should we be thinking about cash taxes in 2022 and 2023, not including the windfall tax as a percentage of pretax cash flow? Does the 10% to 11% range in '22 still seem reasonable?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;PATRICK O'ROURKE, ATB CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Thanks, Robert. I'll pass it back to Lars for that one.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Robert, for 2022, I think forecasting a cash tax rate of 9% to 11% for the full year would be a reasonable range. Keep in mind that does not include any contribution from the acquired core interest. And then for 2023, pre any kind of windfall tax inclusion, 14% to 16% cash tax would be a reasonable estimate. That does include the contribution of the 36. 5% acquired working interest from Equinor.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Menno Hulshof from TD Securities.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;MENNO HULSHOF, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: Thanks, and I'll start with the suspension of the NCIB for Q4. Does that mean you're simply not electing to buy back stock this quarter? Or was there a filing submitted to formally suspend it? I'm just not clear on the mechanics of that? And then the second piece of that is why suspend it at all? It feels like if the upper end of the windfall tax range is $350 million per annum, that there would still be enough to go around for at least some buyback activity. So any thoughts on that front would be helpful as well.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Menno. I'll pass it over to Lars to address those questions.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: On the first part of your question, no formal submission has been made in regards to the NCIB. And so what we really wanted to accomplish with this press release was being transparent with shareholders in terms of taking a pause here in the fourth quarter to reassess the impact of a windfall tax that is likely going to be retroactive in nature as well as potentially exposure to a 2-year period as well.</p><p>So we wanted to take some time to prioritize that. when we do our analysis around the appropriate way to return capital over the longer term, every scenario that we run includes a strong balance sheet in terms of being able to support that return of capital over the longer term. if we end up taking a quarter to ensure that we don't put that strong balance sheet at risk, we think that, that is a pause that is worthwhile over the longer term.</p><p>In terms of the second part of the question Yes, I think that really factors into taking a pause here in the fourth quarter just to make sure that we do prioritize the balance sheet. And we'll reevaluate the merits of capital allocation as we go into 2023 here, incorporating this new information that we have as well as we work through the budget and those other variables.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;MENNO HULSHOF: Yes. And then on windfall taxes, did you now have a better sense of how each of the individual countries are going to manage the EU proposal. And what is your best guess on when we have announcements from each company in which you operate? And is there any risk that these announcements get pushed into 2023?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks Menno -- end maybe this opportunity just to zoom out and talk a little bit more about the windfall tax and capacity as after that to talk about some of the mechanics. It's been interesting time with the policy in Europe. It's during this energy crisis. It's discussions from price caps to windfall taxes and oil and gas companies. I think it's important to note that the current situation is not solely the result of the war, and really the policies that all resulted in declining supply and increasing demand have created a pretty tight market.</p><p>You think about Vermilion over the last 25 years, going back to '97, we put meaningful capital at risk to provide secure energy in Europe. And over that time, we've worked hard or operations to too best-in-class. So for our shareholders, we took some risk and we've deployed capital into that market. And with the guarantees of return and also during some pretty difficult periods here with the commodity price crash. And between 2014 and 2019 as well as, of course, COVID here in 2020. From '97, we were 6,000 barrels a day. And if we look at where we're going to be in 2022, we're in excess of 31,000 and those production that we have in those jurisdictions that places the need to import energy from other areas, which, of course, from a full cycle emission point of view was actually lower.</p><p>And then you get to the economic benefits of producing in Europe. I mean we're displacing the need again to import energy, which means there's deployment. There's support of the service sector, and then there's the royalties and taxes that we pay to both communities and the federal level. If you look at 2022 across our portfolio, like we're looking at cash taxes plus royalties in excess of $550 million, and that's prior to the additional windfall tax. With that in perspective, I mean that's in excess of the $500 million of corporate cash flows we generate in 2020.</p><p>So I mean, our ask from -- as we think about the policies in Europe is really we want stable and predictable policies and two, I'd say, a recognition of twofold. Our business is cyclical, and there's periods of low prices, and there's periods of high prices. And we need those periods of high prices to offset the lows of course.</p><p>And then third, again, the benefits of having producers like Vermilion in that market day-and-date to ensure their secure lower emission energy. But with that, I mean, that's our view is just strategically looking at some of the things that we'll continue to navigate in the near term here, but I'll pass it over to Lars to talk about some of the mechanics of the individual jurisdictions and how it will be applied.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. Menno, I'll just take this chance to reiterate what Dion commented on. We have this disclosure in our press release as well. But -- so the EU regulation requires member states to levy that minimum 33% tax on in-scope companies for 2022 and/or 2023 surplus profits. Surplus profit's defined in the regulation as taxable profits exceeding 120% and of the annual average during that 2018 to 2021 period.</p><p>EU member states are required to implement the tax or some kind of equivalent national measure by December 31, 2022. So we're within weeks of having that finalization. At the end of the day, depending on the national measures that are adopted by the EU member state as well as the financial years, which measures will be applicable that's where we're basically just applying the EU framework at this point to get that estimate of $650 million to $750 million of 2-year cumulative impact. So I think in short order here, we should have a little bit more certainty on at least 2022 in terms of that deadline.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: A bit of a long answer there Menno, but that answers your question.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question will come from Dennis Fong from CIBC World Markets.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;DENNIS FONG, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: The first one really relates a little bit more towards North American operations. Just wanted to understand a little bit in terms of how you're moderating the potential cost inflation impacts, especially given ramping activity both within Mika and then if I think about Powder River Basin as well.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Dennis. I'll pass over Bryce , our VP of North America, just to touch on inflationary pressures in North America.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;BRYCE KREMNICA: Yes. Thanks for the question, Dennis. Yes, overall inflation in North America on the capital side of things is in the range of about 20%. And notably on the OpEx side of things, it's much lower in the 5% range, testament to all the work the team started on managing OpEx and managing contracts.</p><p>Just jumping over specifically to the Powder River Basin. Inflation there is about 20%, up year-over-year. When compared to Canada, our Alberta assets are up about 20%, and then Saskatchewan is probably up the most in the 30% range. So we've done lots of great work in the Powder River Basin executing our cost reduction strategies over the last few years, and we continue to do that.</p><p>This year, we brought a warm crew down from Alberta have only kicked off a program to help manage costs. So we'll continue to do the same. And then with respect to Mika, we got a good view on our costs going into the later half of this year as we've had active operations into Q3, and then we're starting up a new pad into Q4. So we have a good handle on our cost going forward into 2023.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Bryce. Yes. And we're seeing -- again, it's interesting. I think that's 1 of the advantages of our model, Dennis, is to be able to deploy capital in different parts of the business. And put a lot of thought into things like Saskatchewan drilling in the summer when we find costs are lower in the Powder River Basin, again, using crews from Alberta. So again, very thoughtful there, but we are seeing inflation in doing our best to manage it, as Bryce noted,</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;DENNIS FONG: Great. And maybe if I wouldn't mind on -- in terms of kind of an add-on to that question, if there were -- if there was incremental activity within Europe, how would you potentially think about contracting services. I mean, obviously, it's less call it, less busy over there. But how are you thinking about the cost impacts of accelerating activity out there?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Yes. I would say it's less. I can pass over to Darcy just to touch on what we're seeing there for inflation on the services side for Europe.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;DARCY KERWIN: Yes. In Europe, certainly, we're seeing lower inflation numbers on the services side than we're seeing in North America, probably in the range of kind of 5% up to 10%. As you suggested, that's kind of due to limited activity in Europe, and we've gotten a little bit of help as well from the exchange rate that even makes that a little bit lower. So that's kind of fully baked into our plans next year. We -- because of the longer time lines in Europe too, we do tend to acquire tubulars and enter into contracts earlier. So we have a pretty good handle on what the prices look like in Europe for next year.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;DENNIS FONG: Great. And then my last question here is just around hedging. I see like a small uptick in natural gas -- European natural gas hedges as we think about 2023 as a percentage of total production. Can you just kind of reiterate your strategy there? Obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the curve. I wanted to kind of understand if anything has changed on that side.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Yes, Travis, we were quite active in August with some of these higher prices. But with that, I'll pass it over to Lars to touch on our strategy and some of the recent hedges we were able to execute.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. So you can see there in the second half of 2022, European gas hedges got up to that 60% level. 2023, we're at about that 50% level now. Those are probably pretty good bookends to think about in terms of where we could get European gas hedging too. We feel very comfortable with where we're at for 2023 at this point, and it's probably a little bit more around looking to be opportunistic if we do go higher than that versus risk mitigation at this point.</p><p>OPERATOR: We will take our next question from Travis Wood from National Bank Financial.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;TRAVIS WOOD, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. And most of my questions were answered or around those questions and the discussion on Windfall. So that was super helpful. But maybe just in the context of the complexities of the windfall tax and maybe just how you guys are thinking about stressing that into 2023. And then as you think about capital allocation, the language was looking to spend more on European gas projects.</p><p>If you see this or policy language potentially push this into '23 and possibly '24. Would that change your decision to continue to add volumes or cash flow out of the region just to offset some of the future tax? Or how are you thinking about balancing that against a really strong kind of macro backdrop on pricing?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Travis. I'll pass the Lars to address that.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. So in terms of the first part of your question there, Travis, around sort of the complexities around the windfall tax. If you just sort of rewind here, the EU approved this legislation or the framework of the legislation late September. If you think back to the early part of September, there wasn't a lot of discussion around a EU-led windfall tax regime. So the velocity, the pace, the scope of this legislation I don't know if it's unprecedented, but it has been extremely rapid.</p><p>And as you introduce new legislation that's going to impact 27 member states. There's just a lot of moving parts in terms of what that ultimately is going to look like within each of the countries that adopt it. So we're monitoring it as the rest of folks are in terms of what's available in the public domain. But I just want to emphasize that this is legislation. This is a new tax that has evolved very quickly here. What we felt was important was to provide some disclosure here in terms of what the impact could be over that 2-year period, and we'll look to update that disclosure here as we go forward and as we get certainty kind of going into the end of the year here.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: And with respect to capital...</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;TRAVIS WOOD: I mean I think we understand that. But is there -- if you took the status quo and expected this to kind of roll for another couple of years, do you think that would impact the capital decisions in the region? Or is the the bottom line there just too large of a number to position capital to avoid or not avoid, I won't use that word, but to mitigate some of the tax impact in the short term.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Travis. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about capital allocation and how we're thinking about that.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. Travis, we -- as Dion mentioned earlier, we've been navigating operations in Europe for 25 years here. I think it has been a very good place to do business. Absolutely, we're going to have to factor in any kind of windfall tax that would go beyond 2023 into our capital allocation decisions. I think what you heard from Dion as well as Darcy today is, we do have an incentive to allocate more capital to Europe just in terms of we want to be part of the energy security supply response, and we think that we do have a role to play into that.</p><p>We'll obviously have to make sure that we factor in anything here. At this point, it is a temporary fall tax, the scope of it has been limited to '22 and 2023. If we were to extend beyond that, we'd have to factor that into our decisions. But we're in Europe for the long term.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from [Neil Mehta] from [Hudson Bay].</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you hear me?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Yes.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I just want to revisit the windfall tax, I know that's getting a lot of questions this morning. I guess I just wanted to better understand. I know you're saying, obviously, you want to focus on the strength of the balance sheet. First and foremost, and then we look to sort of reintroduce the dividend at some point. And I know in the prepared remarks, you guys expect it to end the balance sheet or net debt a little higher than expected. Kind of, I know it was 1.2% at the year-end, and you have a better sense of where you think that lands?</p><p>And then another way to sort of dig around that. Two is just I think someone asked a little bit earlier, but in a similar manner, if you have a sense of the total magnitude potentially being in that 600 to 700 range or whatever over 2 years. And then what was the thought process spending it now given that we're almost this part in the quarter? Is the tax that retracted for 2022? Is that going to have to be paid like the day of the decision? And therefore, there was a thought that would impact the net debt higher because that's going to be the cash flow from that like a onetime payment? Or is it going to be paid over time for the retroactiveness of 2022? And how does that also get paid for 2023? Is that as it's earned? Like what's the mechanism there for the windfall tax payments?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Okay. Okay. Yes. No, I can -- so a couple of things there. Yes, just to clarify, I mean, we suspended the share buybacks. We are paying and continue to pay the dividend. And again, our strategy is to provide ratable increases of the dividend over time. with respect to the mechanics of when the windfall tax would be accrued and paid. I'll pass it back to Lars to talk about that.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. And I'll address that as well as your question around debt balance as well. I think that the $1.2 billion debt target was going to be a nice landing spot at the end in terms of being able to go lower than that in 2023 as well as being able to return capital. Our estimate now that incorporates the windfall tax would be about $1.6 billion of exit 2022 net debt.</p><p>And that's a segue into the third part of your question in terms of the accounting for the windfall tax. Ultimately, it's going to be subject to when legislation gets finalized. As I mentioned earlier, there is a mandate right now for member states to have legislation in place by the end of this year, assuming that comes to fruition, and that is met, we would expect that to trigger an accrual for the windfall tax 2022 exposure in the fourth quarter of this year. So that will get reflected in 2022.</p><p>We've embedded that into that $1.6 billion net debt estimate. In terms of when that was cash -- or when that tax would be payable, that will be variable depending on the country, but I would expect it to range anywhere from early to late first half of 2023.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: And then just to sort of, I guess, related a little bit of a follow-up. I think you sounded like a couple of the countries that have sort of come to a policy and our outstanding on a couple of other ones. I think mostly at Ireland and Germany. On the countries that have come in so far on their sort of policies or on windfall tax, how is it compared to what you guys were thinking and relative to kind of what was implementing?</p><p>Is it sort of in line with that or better, et cetera? And are there any offsets that you guys have in those countries that may are factored into your estimates right now? Or are there -- at this point, there are no offsets in the estimates. And then also, just back to the accounting and how it's pay and all that stuff, like, again, back to like if you're exiting with $1.6 billion this year on net debt and you're looking at sort of production into 2023, if it's a similar level, I guess, and kind of what people have out there for estimates, it looks like cash flow generation should be fairly robust. And given the total size of the windfall tax is estimated and the net debt exiting this year, does the -- is it still feasible for you to reach your net debt target next year, that's sort of sub-$1 billion and you're back to sort of in that range of free cash flow generation and being able to pay out 50% or so of the free cash flow into 2023 once the buybacks are resumed.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Yes. I'll just paraphrase the question here. And some of these, again, we can or to meet with you off-line if you can get into some of the more modeling questions. But I'll pass to Lars here around just to comment on maybe some of the offset mechanics of the windfall tax. And just secondly, how we're thinking about debt targets for next year?</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;LARS GLEMSER: Yes. So just back to the windfall tax, without getting into each of the 4 countries that will have windfall tax exposure, there are varying degrees there in terms of certainty in terms of how the framework is going to be employed. I would say at this point, we have factored in all information that we have today into that estimate of $650 million to $750 million. There's quite a bit of nuances once you get into each country, both from a, I'd call it a front office as well as back office perspective in terms of how the calculation is ultimately going to unfold.</p><p>And then just back to your question -- follow-up question on debt here. So if you start with that $1. 6 billion at the end of 2022, just as a reminder, we have fully burdened that with our estimate for the core of closing cost as well. If that gets pushed to 2023. That's something that will shift between '22 and '23.</p><p>In terms of net debt balance, debt target for 2023, that's something that we'll work through here. A good landing spot could be targeting an undrawn credit facility revolver, in terms of setting ourselves up strongly for 2024 and then navigating the uncertainties that are there regardless of windfall tax in terms of commodity price uncertainty. But that is the pause that we wanted to take here in the fourth quarter is just to work through those decisions and what's the right capital allocation.</p><p>We have a firm belief that by taking a pause here in the fourth quarter, the fact that, that free cash flow, it is still going to accrue to shareholders, it will accrue to shareholders through a lower debt balance in terms of where we exit this year as opposed to a lower share count. And if that puts us in a position to accelerate buybacks in 2023, we think that that's a prudent decision here in the short term.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. And then I guess maybe just a final 1 on that last one. You said obviously accruing to shareholders. I guess, a big part of the [brilliant] store. And I know it's sort of part of the energy space in general has been sort of the capital return story. And I guess the pause near term given sort of the windfall tax situation. And I don't know if there's any related on the production or cost side as well, if that any reason there.</p><p>But how important does the capital returns remain as part of Vermilion's sort of shareholder story in general, just given that the pause is happening here. And obviously, there's going to be a reaction from shareholders to that. So...</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: Yes, I can take this one. I mean I think if you look back on the history of the company, we paid over $40 a share of dividends. Our focus is to have a strong balance sheet. And as debt levels decrease to to return increasing amounts of cash flow to our shareholders. And again, over the longer time frame, we've consistently done that.</p><p>I think to Lars' point, we were about 25%, 26% of free cash flow return to our shareholders for return of capital in Q3. We hit the pause in Q4. And again, really just that trade-off of near-term gathering more data as well as prioritizing year-end debt balance. And I think it just positions us to be that much stronger going into 2023.</p><p>If you look at where our debt level is going to be and where the strip pricing is currently for all commodities, again, we think we're positioned well. The next step for us is to continue to work through this in December, and we look forward to releasing our budget early in the new year. And that I think then would provide an appropriate time to really get into the details around spending levels, free cash flow levels or thoughts on return on capital. But just to be clear, a pause in Q4 does not, in any way, infer our change our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Again, we've got a long-term track record of doing that. It was truly for this quarter to pause and gather additional information and focus on a lower year-end debt target.</p><p>OPERATOR: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dion Hatcher for any additional or closing remarks.</p><p>&amp;GT;&amp;GT;ANTHONY HATCHER: I just want to say thank you again for participating in our Q3 release</p><p>OPERATOR: That will conclude today's conference.

It's a positive first step, according to the Canadian Airports Council (CAC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While it is good to see the air sector get direct attention in the Fall Economic Statement, what was announced on Monday appears to fall short of what Canada's airports and our industry partners need to endure COVID-19,\" said CAC president, Daniel-Robert Gooch. \"While we are still seeking additional detail on what was announced, we do know more will be required to ensure airports are able to endure the difficult period ahead.\"</p><p>While the government announced measures to support airports and regional air service, the Canadian Airport Council is concerned that not all major issues have been addressed yet, including federal plans for rapid antigen screening at airports.</p><p>\"Our current priority is to restore consumer confidence and open up safe air travel in time for next summer,\" Gooch explained. \"This requires rapid antigen screening at airports and a path to reduce quarantines. We have three to four months to get it right for our communities and tourism partners to participate in the recovery of travel and tourism we expect to start seeing in other northern countries next summer. It is not realistic to wait for Canadians and international travellers to be vaccinated: it could take years before some parts of the world are immunized.\"</p><p>Aviation was one of the most severely affected sectors from the pandemic, with passenger traffic cratering to only 10 to 15 percent of what it was in 2019. Unlike many other countries, most of Canada's airports are not subsidized by government. With few passengers and little revenue, the system is broken. Employment in the sector as a whole has been slashed by 50 percent or more. While airports remain open to support the regular commuting of essential workers like nurses, shipments of food, air ambulance, forest fire suppression and other essential services, the revenues that support these services come from passengers.</p><p>The Fall Economic Statement did provide deferrals and waivers for airport ground rent at 22 airports. However, this was primarily for just one year in which low revenues mean little to no rent would have been due for most of these airports in 2021. Calculated as a charge on revenue, airport rent serves as a form of dividend airport authorities pay to the federal government, which continues to own these community assets. After 10 months of deep financial losses, multiple years of rent waivers are required for these airports to arrest the precarious financial situation they are in.</p><p>Strong Canadian communities need strong Canadian airports, and they are feeling the pain. In June, Air Canada suspended flights to 30 Canadian communities and in October, WestJet eliminated service to four Atlantic Canada cities. Without government intervention, additional route cancellations are likely, and some communities fear it will be difficult to get air service back.</p><p>\"Suspended air routes not only affect people's ability to travel, but severely impacts inbound tourism and trade,\" said Gooch. \"The effects could linger for years after Canadians are ready to travel again in great numbers.\"</p><p>\"The challenge early on was convincing government that the air sector required its own relief measures, over and above what was done for businesses in general,\" he continued. \"It took an industry-wide push to get the government to see it the same way. We are grateful for the efforts of our partners in the industry, including air carriers, air sector workers and members of Parliament in drawing attention to the urgency of the situation.\"</p><p>In the months leading up to this announcement the Canadian Airports Council developed recommendations to the federal government that include:</p><p>Implementing a nationally consistent and globally aligned rapid antigen screening program at airports to reduce or eliminate quarantine restrictions and restore consumer confidence in air travel.</p><p>Extending a multi-year moratorium on ground lease rents at the eight busiest airports until business has recovered.</p><p>Eliminating rent for the 14 small airports, which has never raised more than $15 million in government revenue.</p><p>Providing interest-free loans or direct operational support for airports.</p><p>Increasing annual Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) funding for very small airports to $95 million for at least five years.</p><p>New funding for safety and security related infrastructure at airports not eligible for ACAP, to maintain safe infrastructure, pay for COVID-19 adaptations, and implement new federal regulations projected to cost more than $350 million</p><p>The Fall Economic Statement included increases to ACAP funding and a $500 million in infrastructure funding for safety, security and transit, which are positive developments for those airports in a financial position to meet their portion of the funding investment these programs will require.</p><p>\"I think at this stage it is fair to say that airports received some, but not all of what they need,\" Gooch concluded. \"In normal times, this may have been enough, but these are not normal times. We still need to be sure that the government is giving airports meaningful support to provide Canadian with the mobility and access to essential goods and services.\"</p><p>###</p><p>About the Canadian Airports Council</p><p>The Canadian Airports Council (CAC), a division of Airports Council International-North America, is the voice for Canada's airports community. Its 54 members represent more than 100 airports, including all of the privately operated National Airports System (NAS) airports and many municipal airports across Canada.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, Canada's airports supported nearly 200,000 jobs, generating $13 billion in wages and $7 billion in taxes to all levels of government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124116937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61FD-BJV1-DYTH-G0J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggests world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe.</p><p>Governments around the world are deploying an increasing number of military UAV systems. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>In August 2022, Japan announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces. Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. The technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups continues to remain strong in 2022 after a robust 2021. In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities. In September 2022, Japanese flying car and cargo drone developer SkyDrive Inc. raised 9.6 billion yen in its Series C funding round, bringing the company's total funding to date to 14.7 billion yen. The same month, Flyability, the leading indoor inspection drone company, raised CHF15 million in Series C funding for its collision-tolerant drone, Elios 3. Elios 3 allows inspectors to visualize their assets in 3D models created in real-time as the drone flies. In August 2022, drone delivery company Windracers landed a third round of funding from the Future Flight challenge at UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a government-backed organization. The funding amount was not disclosed.</p><p>In June 2022, Detroit-based drone software provider Airspace Link raised $23 million at a valuation of nearly $200 million. The company aims to build highways in the sky for the unmanned aircrafts. In June 2022, Indoor Robotics, an indoor drone technology company raised $15 million in Series A funding. This round will enable Indoor Robotics to push product development and expand in new geographies. In May 2022, US-based drone software company SkySpecs raised $80 million in Series D funding. The company works with wind farms to monitor the health of turbine blades.</p><p>In April 2022, solar drone inspection provider Raptor Maps raised $22 million in funding. Using drone aircraft, Raptor Maps captures images, including thermal imagery, of both potential PV sites and installed facilities. In March 2022, advanced air mobility leader Skyports raised $23 million in Series B funding. The funding will allow the company to strengthen its status as a global leader in the advanced air mobility infrastructure and drone operations sectors. Another startup, Terra Drone Corp raised $70 million in Series B funding in March 2022. The funding will be used to scale up operations and invest in innovation.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there has been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every new produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>What is needed for instance is rules that limit flights to daylight and visual-line-of-sight operations, height restrictions, operator certification, optional use of a visual observer, aircraft registration and marking, and operational limits.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>McKinsey notes that as of early 2022, more than 2,000 drone deliveries are occurring each day worldwide. The growth rate is accelerating, and it projects that there will be close to 1.5 million deliveries in 2022 in total, up from just under half a million in 2021.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>In October 2022, Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing announced the launch of its operations in Ireland. Initially, Wing will focus on delivering small, light parcels ordered to vendors close to the buyers' homes, mostly containing food or medicines. In October 2022, Zipline announced the launch of drone delivery of prescriptions and other medicines to the households of Salt Lake City in the US. This move follows similar service launched in North Carolina last year.</p><p>In September 2022, Africa-focused e-commerce firm Jumia Technologies partnered with drone-delivery startup Zipline to deliver household items to remote areas of Ghana. This will enable customers from remote and rural areas to order and receive electronics, cosmetics, fashion and other products.</p><p>In June 2022, Walmart announced same day drone deliveries in six US states. The move follows years of small scale testing and now customers will be able to get the goods delivered in as little as 30 minutes. The six states include Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Texas, Utah and Virginia, with the potential to reach up to four million homes, according to Walmart.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. The latest is Mesa Air Group, which in October 2021, announced partnership with aerospace technology company, Flirtey to launch last-mile food delivery business using drones in the US. Mesa will first order four delivery drones from Flirtey, with an option to order an additional 500 drones.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratory. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available at near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey a farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>The German chemical company Basf in partnership with the Spanish research center Tecnalia, has developed a technology whereby drones can be used to see which diseases and/or pests a farmer is dealing with on their fields. This could significantly improve the crop yield.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying over crowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best to integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hack. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones in particular could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

It's a positive first step, according to the Canadian Airports Council (CAC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While it is good to see the air sector get direct attention in the Fall Economic Statement, what was announced on Monday appears to fall short of what Canada's airports and our industry partners need to endure COVID-19,\" said CAC president, Daniel-Robert Gooch. \"While we are still seeking additional detail on what was announced, we do know more will be required to ensure airports are able to endure the difficult period ahead.\"</p><p>While the government announced measures to support airports and regional air service, the Canadian Airport Council is concerned that not all major issues have been addressed yet, including federal plans for rapid antigen screening at airports.</p><p>\"Our current priority is to restore consumer confidence and open up safe air travel in time for next summer,\" Gooch explained. \"This requires rapid antigen screening at airports and a path to reduce quarantines. We have three to four months to get it right for our communities and tourism partners to participate in the recovery of travel and tourism we expect to start seeing in other northern countries next summer. It is not realistic to wait for Canadians and international travellers to be vaccinated: it could take years before some parts of the world are immunized.\"</p><p>Aviation was one of the most severely affected sectors from the pandemic, with passenger traffic cratering to only 10 to 15 percent of what it was in 2019. Unlike many other countries, most of Canada's airports are not subsidized by government. With few passengers and little revenue, the system is broken. Employment in the sector as a whole has been slashed by 50 percent or more. While airports remain open to support the regular commuting of essential workers like nurses, shipments of food, air ambulance, forest fire suppression and other essential services, the revenues that support these services come from passengers.</p><p>The Fall Economic Statement did provide deferrals and waivers for airport ground rent at 22 airports. However, this was primarily for just one year in which low revenues mean little to no rent would have been due for most of these airports in 2021. Calculated as a charge on revenue, airport rent serves as a form of dividend airport authorities pay to the federal government, which continues to own these community assets. After 10 months of deep financial losses, multiple years of rent waivers are required for these airports to arrest the precarious financial situation they are in.</p><p>Strong Canadian communities need strong Canadian airports, and they are feeling the pain. In June, Air Canada suspended flights to 30 Canadian communities and in October, WestJet eliminated service to four Atlantic Canada cities. Without government intervention, additional route cancellations are likely, and some communities fear it will be difficult to get air service back.</p><p>\"Suspended air routes not only affect people's ability to travel, but severely impacts inbound tourism and trade,\" said Gooch. \"The effects could linger for years after Canadians are ready to travel again in great numbers.\"</p><p>\"The challenge early on was convincing government that the air sector required its own relief measures, over and above what was done for businesses in general,\" he continued. \"It took an industry-wide push to get the government to see it the same way. We are grateful for the efforts of our partners in the industry, including air carriers, air sector workers and members of Parliament in drawing attention to the urgency of the situation.\"</p><p>In the months leading up to this announcement the Canadian Airports Council developed recommendations to the federal government that include:</p><p>- Implementing a nationally consistent and globally aligned rapid antigen screening program at airports to reduce or eliminate quarantine restrictions and restore consumer confidence in air travel.</p><p>- Extending a multi-year moratorium on ground lease rents at the eight busiest airports until business has recovered.</p><p>- Eliminating rent for the 14 small airports, which has never raised more than $15 million in government revenue.</p><p>- Providing interest-free loans or direct operational support for airports.</p><p>- Increasing annual Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) funding for very small airports to $95 million for at least five years.</p><p>- New funding for safety and security related infrastructure at airports not eligible for ACAP, to maintain safe infrastructure, pay for COVID-19 adaptations, and implement new federal regulations projected to cost more than $350 million</p><p>The Fall Economic Statement included increases to ACAP funding and a $500 million in infrastructure funding for safety, security and transit, which are positive developments for those airports in a financial position to meet their portion of the funding investment these programs will require.</p><p>\"I think at this stage it is fair to say that airports received some, but not all of what they need,\" Gooch concluded. \"In normal times, this may have been enough, but these are not normal times. We still need to be sure that the government is giving airports meaningful support to provide Canadian with the mobility and access to essential goods and services.\"</p><p>[Category: Aerospace]</p><p>Contact: Debra Ward, 613/274-0691, 613/850-9118, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:debra.ward@cacairports.ca\">debra.ward@cacairports.ca</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7320481 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7320481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61H9-3P61-DYG2-R225-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><timeReceived>1:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They are not restricted to the Mediterranean space anymore but reach Northern Europe as well. In recent years, fires have taken place even above the Arctic Circle.</p><p>Several factors contribute to the increased risk. Successful forest conservation efforts mean that there is more fuel available for fires. The stock felled makes up only two-thirds of woodland grown during the last decades.</p><p>Secondly, as the climate changes, forests have become more and more dry and dead material piled up in them, which are likelier to be set ablaze.</p><p>Furthermore, sprawling cities and intensely cultivated agriculture lands get into contact with forest areas more often. In some regions up to half of the surface area can be seen as a so-called \"Wildland Urban Interface\" (WUI).</p><p>While Europe so far avoided industrial calamities caused by wildfires, it had to deal with a few close calls, creating a sense of urgency for coming up with a more comprehensive action plan for disaster preparedness in so-called \"Wildland Industrial Interfaces\" (WII).</p><p>The European Commission's Seveso-III Directive from 2012 lists a host of measures to be implemented against major accident hazards.</p><p>It mostly focuses on minimising industrial sites' negative impact on people and the environment, but also requires consideration of their own vulnerability to events in nature like wildfires.</p><p>However, there is no integrated European fire management system that would meet the requirements for preventing industrial accidents caused by wildfires.</p><p>The authors of the JRC report therefore argue that a combined effort of a wider range of stakeholders, such as plant operators, forest management, land use planners, or researchers should be included in accident prevention and preparedness in WII, among other recommendations.</p><p>Flying embers, firebrands, flames</p><p>Wildfires can harm urban spaces and industrial plants in a number of ways, sometimes triggering a cascade of events.</p><p>While the direct impact of flames or the heat caused by burning surroundings are the most obvious sources of hazard, sometimes people and buildings suffer before the fire front reaches them.</p><p>Embers and burning debris particles (firebrands) can get into contact with combustible roofs, windows, or air intakes, creating spot fires, which then fan out. Toxic smoke can get into cars attempting to drive through it, causing deaths.</p><p>Pipelines for transporting oil and gas, fuel storage facilities, external floating roof tanks for combustible liquids are especially vulnerable to the spread of wildfires.</p><p>A collective effort against fire damage</p><p>A lot depends on where industrial plants are built. Places with low moisture, high wind speeds and upward slopes are especially prone to fire propagation.</p><p>However, even if a good location was chosen, plant operators rely on external actors for keeping wildfire risk low.</p><p>Forest management should keep vegetation in check, while knowing that sometimes less is more. In the US, the practice of aggressively suppressing wildfires, which are part of the natural renewal of forest ecosystems, left more fuel for fires that did occur, making them more violent.</p><p>Crops can act as bridges, carrying fire from the forest to industrial facilities, something that land use planners must keep in mind.</p><p>Raising awareness among the population nearby can help, too.

Some researchers say an additional 30million to 40million first shots could be enough for the United States to reach a vaccine tipping point and containment of the disease caused by the coronavirus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's just another 10% to 15% more people,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overall, 44% of the nation's population has received at least one shot and 31% is fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among U.S. adults, 56% have gotten at least one dose. A tipping point comes when enough people are vaccinated that COVID-19 cases begin to fall dramatically and the spread of the virus is contained - not stopped, but slowed enough to prevent large outbreaks.</p><p>\"When you're at 50% or so, you have a significant amount of downward pressure on cases. Half the people who are being potentially exposed to the virus no longer can get it. That's a very big deal,\" said Dr. Robert Wachter, professor and chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.</p><p>Topol pointed to California, which has vaccinated 50% of its residents, as the poster child for what levels of vaccination only a little higher can mean. The state's  seven-day average case rate is just 4.3 cases per 100,000 people. That's down from 5.5 per 100,000 a month ago and 9.6 cases per 100,000 for the last week in February.</p><p>\"We're seeing the first hint of this here,\" he said. \"It's the largest state (by population), and it's never looked this good since basically Day One of the pandemic.\"</p><p>In San Francisco, where 72% of people ages 16 and over have received at least one dose of vaccine, only six people died of COVID-19 in the  month of April. That's in a county of 882,000.</p><p>\"These numbers are dropping dramatically, down fivefold in terms of the death rate,\" said Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health.</p><p>He attributes the drop to the city's focus on public health measures to lower transmission and community-based vaccination campaigns.</p><p>\"We've built an 'every door is the right door' approach to vaccination,\" Colfax said.</p><p>Encouraging numbers</p><p>While cases are rising in some states, nationwide they're falling. Perhaps most important, they're dropping like a stone in highly vaccinated age groups. Among Americans ages 65 and older, who are most vulnerable to the disease, two-thirds are fully vaccinated.</p><p>They were 94% less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than people of the same age who were not vaccinated, a CDC report last week showed.</p><p>Those trends keep working their way down the population as more people get vaccinated, said Vermont Department of Financial Regulation Commissioner Michael Pieciak, the state's lead on state  COVID-19 modeling and data. Vermont has the nation's third-highest vaccination rate at 56%.</p><p>\"COVID case rates are down 60% over the month of April,\" Pieciak said, even among younger, less-vaccinated people.</p><p>While better weather allowing for more outdoor activities may be a factor, he says,  vaccination played an important role.</p><p>\"We basically got close to that 50% mark in the middle of April,\" Pieciak said. Even though that (younger) group isn't well covered yet, the rest of the Vermont population had good coverage, and that had an effect.\"</p><p>The United Kingdom reached its tipping point when about 50% its residents received their first dose, said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor at the University of California, San Francisco. Cases there have fallen 10%, and deaths were down 31% in the past week.</p><p>In Israel, which at 60% has one of the world's highest vaccination levels, COVID-19 cases are down to less than 1person in 100,000.</p><p>Gandhi is working with disease modelers who project that U.S. cases may fall to 10,000 a day on May 29 or sooner. Currently, the U.S. sees 48,000 cases a day - the first time since October the daily number has dipped below 50,000 and 17% lower than the week before.</p><p>Getting an additional 30 million to 40million Americans vaccinated will take community-based approaches, motivation messaging and lots of education, but Gandhi believes it's possible.</p><p>\"I am almost positive we can get 60% of adults to agree to vaccination - at which point containment seems sealed,\" she said.</p><p>Topol added: \"It doesn't really matter who gets vaccinated. We just need to find another 40 million people to do it.\"</p><p>Not out of the woods</p><p>Not everyone, however, is convinced the number of vaccinations needed is quite that low.</p><p>Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, believes that to bring COVID-19 under control, closer to 80% of the population needs to have immunity.</p><p>Between vaccinations and natural immunity from previous infections, he puts the United States at about 50% population immunity right now.</p><p>He attributes the decrease in cases nationwide to a combination of vaccination, immunity through infection and a natural waning of the virus during the spring and summer.</p><p>\"COVID-19 at its heart is a winter virus,\" Offit said.</p><p>If his numbers are right, the nation still needs a big chunk of the population to roll up its sleeves.</p><p>\"You need to vaccinate another 100million people before next winter hits,\" he said.</p><p>Israel is seeing success with lower overall vaccination levels because Israelis behave differently, Offit said.</p><p>\"They have vaccine passports, so you can go into a place where you know other people are vaccinated. They think like a society, but we think as a group of individuals,\" he said.</p><p>Others point out that reaching a tipping point at which cases drops dramatically isn't the same as achieving herd immunity, which confers a population broad protection from disease. Herd immunity is estimated to require 80% to 90% of people protected.</p><p>\"My hunch is that there are many places that will have lots vaccinated and there will be other places where for political or many other reasons will choose not be vaccinated. So while overall numbers will certainly drop, I worry about flare-ups,\" said Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p><p>In Westchester County, New York, where 52% of people have had at least one dose of vaccine, COVID-19 case counts, hospitalizations and deaths are trending downward, said Dr. Dial Hewlett, medical director of the county's division of disease control. He worries that as COVID-19 rates decrease, the unvaccinated will feel less pressure to sign up for a shot.</p><p>\"It's like when you have a big forest fire and you're able to contain just about the entire fire but there are smoldering embers that can flare up,\" he said. \"We don't want to let our guard down and become complacent.\"</p><p>FDA likely to authorize Pfizer shots for teens.</p><p>\"Intense ground game\" to get shots in arms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Emanual Hernandes receives a COVID-19 vaccination at a mobile clinic in a partnership between the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and the Milwaukee Health Department before a game Sunday at Fiserv Forum.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff Hanisch/USA TODAY Sports</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUIDNW-usa2203594564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N4-50V1-DYJJ-P1GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1159\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 6, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

We just need to find another 40 million people to do it.\"</p><p>Not out of the woods</p><p>Not everyone, however, is convinced the number of vaccinations needed is quite that low.</p><p>Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, believes that to bring COVID-19 under control, closer to 80% of the population needs to have immunity.</p><p>Between vaccinations and natural immunity from previous infections, he puts the United States at about 50% population immunity right now.</p><p>He attributes the decrease in cases nationwide to a combination of vaccination, immunity through infection and a natural waning of the virus during the spring and summer.</p><p>\"COVID-19 at its heart is a winter virus,\" Offit said.</p><p>If his numbers are right, the nation still needs a big chunk of the population to roll up its sleeves.</p><p>\"You need to vaccinate another 100million people before next winter hits,\" he said.</p><p>Israel is seeing success with lower overall vaccination levels because Israelis behave differently, Offit said.</p><p>\"They have vaccine passports, so you can go into a place where you know other people are vaccinated. They think like a society, but we think as a group of individuals,\" he said.</p><p>Others point out that reaching a tipping point at which cases drops dramatically isn't the same as achieving herd immunity, which confers a population broad protection from disease. Herd immunity is estimated to require 80% to 90% of people protected.</p><p>\"My hunch is that there are many places that will have lots vaccinated and there will be other places where for political or many other reasons will choose not be vaccinated. So while overall numbers will certainly drop, I worry about flare-ups,\" said Barry Bloom, an immunologist and global health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p><p>In Westchester County, New York, where 52% of people have had at least one dose of vaccine, COVID-19 case counts, hospitalizations and deaths are trending downward, said Dr. Dial Hewlett, medical director of the county's division of disease control. He worries that as COVID-19 rates decrease, the unvaccinated will feel less pressure to sign up for a shot.</p><p>\"It's like when you have a big forest fire and you're able to contain just about the entire fire but there are smoldering embers that can flare up,\" he said. \"We don't want to let our guard down and become complacent.\"</p><p>More inside</p><p>FDA likely to authorize Pfizer shots for teens. 1D</p><p>\"Intense ground game\" to get shots in arms. 1D</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Emanual Hernandes receives a COVID-19 vaccination at a mobile clinic in a partnership between the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and the Milwaukee Health Department before a game Sunday at Fiserv Forum.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff Hanisch/USA TODAY Sports</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUIDNW-usa2203213784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N4-50V1-DYJJ-P1CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1162\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 5, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Each year, the initiative will select 20 fellows to engage in 11-month placements that help build community resilience and respond to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During their service stint, fellows will tackle projects that promote regenerative agriculture, forest and fire protections, and carbon sequestration while building long-term resilience. The inaugural cohort began their placements in early September.</p><p>\"CLEE focuses extensively on the climate crisis, finding both innovative solutions and ways to overcome persistent barriers,\" says Jordan Diamond '08, the center's executive director. \"GrizzlyCorps is a concentrated expression of that mission, focusing on providing vital support to farm and forest communities that often bear the brunt of climate harm and have meaningful opportunities to realize climate progress.\"</p><p>Focused in rural areas, the program is designed to help build forest, fire, and overall community resilience -- all essential amid California's increasingly severe climate impacts. After this pilot year, leaders hope to expand the program's scope and reach more communities statewide.</p><p>\"Bringing together AmeriCorps requirements and UCBerkeley requirements wasn't easy,\" says GrizzlyCorps Director Ken Alex, who also directs Project Climate. \"But we persevered and now have a functioning program, with strong support from the Provost's office. GrizzlyCorps brings together many elements of key importance: action on climate change, community resilience and outreach, service in underserved communities, focus on rural California, promotion of forest and farm issues, and opportunities for recent grads.\"</p><p>Targeted and timely</p><p>California's forest communities face enormous (and growing) fire and climate threats, which also threaten watershed and soil health. Alex notes that in farm communities, climate change is impacting the state's water supply, crop yields, and cattle health. He says forest and farm communities can advance carbon sequestration -- the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide to help reduce its presence in the atmosphere -- which can also increase crop and grassland yields and improve forest health.</p><p>Fellows work in conjunction with agricultural community entities and resource conservation districts to broaden the use of regenerative techniques. In forest communities, they coordinate with local, state, and federal agencies, forest and industry groups, and NGOs to expand techniques that reduce fire risk and enhance watershed and soil conditions.</p><p>A 2019 planning grant through California Volunteers (directed by Berkeley Law graduate Josh Fryday '09), the agency that administers AmeriCorps in the state, enabled CLEE to develop the program, design the type of work fellows would do, and find site partners for placements.</p><p>\"We try to match site partner picks and member picks as much as possible,\" Alex says. \"The program is modeled on CivicSpark, an AmeriCorps program run by the Local Government Commission in Sacramento (which he initiated as senior policy advisor to then-California Gov. Jerry Brown). The two programs are fairly unique. CivicSpark is about to expand into Washington State, and we're talking about making both CivicSpark and GrizzlyCorps national programs.\"</p><p>GrizzlyCorps fellows receive training, field experience with direct supervision, a monthly stipend, and $10,000 towards further education upon completion of the full placement, as well as opportunities to develop professional contacts and mentors. Geared toward recent college graduates, the program aims to expand opportunities for enrolled students in the future.</p><p>Enthusiastic response</p><p>Jenna Waite, who graduated from UCBerkeley in May, yearned to use her passion for politics and policy to help the environment. Placed with The McConnell Foundation in her hometown of Redding, her main projects involve rehabilitating hundreds of acres of rangeland that has been overtaken by weeds, sustainable agriculture and research, and community outreach.</p><p>\"The GrizzlyCorps program piqued my interest because I wanted to work with environmental nonprofits and programs,\" Waite says. \"I wasn't originally planning on staying in my hometown after college, but I couldn't let this opportunity go.\"</p><p>Rose Joseph, another 2020 UCBerkeley graduate, is working with the Tehama County Resource Conservation District. Her projects include replanting fish habitats along the Sacramento River, creating defensible space around the homes of vulnerable populations to reduce the potential for wildfire damage from wildfire, and creating carbon farm plans.</p><p>As a college student, Joseph became interested in the politics of land, food systems, and climate change. A fifth-generation Californian with roots in agriculture reaching back four generations, her family currently grows wine grapes in Sonoma County.</p><p>\"As my time at Berkeley progressed and as my family's vineyard faced the effects of drought -- and even had half of our land burned in a wildfire -- I realized that I wanted to do more to address the significant challenges in how my home state manages its land and food systems, especially in the context of a changing climate,\" Joseph says. \"I am beyond excited for this year of service.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7262496 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7262496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:611N-41D1-DYG2-R14R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 10, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They also tied into the Keystone Fire scar and worked in front of the fire in the Rob Roy and Cinnabar Park areas.</p><p>\"Thick smoke from the multiple operations was carried into Laramie by the robust west wind. The volume of smoke from the northwest reflected the area's fuel density.\"</p><p>The increased size of the Mullen Fire prompted a management handover Monday to a Southern Area Type 1 Blue Team. A Rocky Mountain Type 2 Blue Team managed the fire for more than two weeks prior. The Mullen Fire started Sept. 17 in the Savage Run Wilderness and has since mostly expanded to the north, east and south.</p><p>There are now 1,104 firefighting personnel battling the fire, along with a large fleet of a variety of aerial firefighting aircraft and helicopters when weather conditions and calmer winds allow for safety precautions.

'Projections of water supply and runoff-related hazards must account for wildfire.' <br/>The basins evaluated by the research team were 10 square kilometers or larger and had at least 45 years of historical streamflow data. They were also at least 25% forested and minimally disturbed by human impact, to minimize variables in the water supply equation. Researchers found that in basins where 20% or more of the forest burned, average streamflows increased about 30% over the following six years. Several western Montana basins were included in the study. <br/>'The amount of water we should have had through this 20-year drought is a fair bit less than we did have, and that's due in part to fire. It's almost like a correction.' Ben Livneh, University of Colorado, Boulder civil engineering professor <br/>The increase in streamflow was most dramatic during spring and fall. The fall increase came as a surprise, the authors wrote, because both streamflow and transpiration \u2014 the process by which plants take up soil moisture from their roots and release it into the air as vapor \u2014 are typically lower in the fall. They say future research on post-fire fall streamflow levels could yield insights about the dominant mechanisms at work. <br/>One of the study authors said the research points to interesting landscape-level dynamics at the intersection of drought, wildfire and water supply. <br/>'It could be that fires seem to kind of offset drought in interesting ways in terms of water supply,' Western Water Assessment Director and University of Colorado, Boulder civil engineering professor Ben Livneh said. 'The amount of water we should have had through this 20-year drought is a fair bit less than we did have, and that's due in part to fire. It's almost like a correction.' <br/> What else you need to know: <br/> 02.28.202203.01.2022  <br/> 02.28.202203.02.2022  <br/> 02.25.202202.25.2022  <br/><br/><br/>Livneh also noted that wildfire's impact on watersheds can create water quality challenges. The erosion and sedimentation that often follow wildfire \u2014 particularly after heavy rains \u2014 can make water difficult and expensive to treat to safety standards due to ash, sediment, nutrients and contaminants[2]. <br/>'There's some precedent for water [managers] essentially letting the soot-laden water flow downstream,' Livneh said. 'The cost of treating that water can be prohibitive.' <br/>From an ecological perspective, Bob Gresswell, a former U.S. Geological Survey researcher and professor emeritus in Montana State University's Department of Ecology, said he considers three factors in discussions about how wildfire affects aquatic ecosystems: the watershed's pre-fire biophysical characteristics, including topography, geology, vegetation cover and erosion potential; how hot the fire burned and how much vegetation it consumed; and the post-fire weather forecast, particularly in terms of precipitation. <br/>Most landscapes tend to be pretty resilient in the face of wildfire, but a watershed prone to erosion hit with a large, hot, wind-driven fire followed by heavy rain can have detrimental effects on stream ecosystems, he said. <br/>In some basins, a 'perfect storm' scenario could send downed trees and mud slurry scouring a channel. Further downstream, larger detritus starts to settle out and finer material is deposited in streambed gravel, damaging the diversity of macroinvertebrates that fish feed on \u2014though those impacts are generally short-lived, and fish adjust their diet to other insects as needed. <br/>In worst-case scenarios, natural resource managers have some options to minimize fire's impacts to aquatic ecosystems, Gresswell said. That could include collecting vulnerable species of fish with limited distributions to restock a fire-stricken stream once it has stabilized. <br/>Gresswell added that it sometimes takes time to appreciate the benefits offered by disturbance events like wildfire. For example: Over time streams can lose large structures \u2014 logs \u2014 that provide shade and cover for fish. A wildfire can deposit new logs into the stream, which helps keep gravel and other desirable substrates in the channel. <br/>Gresswell also emphasized that most aquatic ecosystems tend to recover just fine following wildfire. Even if a fire kills fish in smaller basins, there are often other populations living in side channels or upstream that can repopulate streams in the burn site. <br/>Dave McWethy, an associate professor in MSU's Department of Earth Sciences with a particular interest in disturbance ecology, said the study forefronts interesting questions about the relationship between wildfire, water supply, vegetation patterns and climate change. <br/>McWethy has been researching expansions of woody mass \u2014 trees and shrubs \u2014 in locations across Montana. He said a trio of factors converging in places like the Missouri River Breaks are resulting in an increase of juniper and lodgepole pine in parts of the Great Plains that have historically been dominated by grasslands[3]. <br/>'The big question is which way is this going to go? Are these big fires that we've had in the last five years going to remove woody material and counter this woody plant expansion, or are we going to get more woody plants?' Dave McWethy, Montana State University professor, Department of Earth Sciences <br/>Those factors include an overall increase in precipitation in semi-arid regions of the Northern Great Plains[4], an increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide available to aid rapid plant growth, and the post-European-colonization suppression of wildfire. The absence of frequent fire has allowed species like lodgepole pine to become more established in areas where they would otherwise have been unlikely to persist, McWethy said. <br/>That trend seems to also coincide with a reduction in streamflow, because the pines act like 'straws' pulling water from soil and surface flows, McWethy said. Wildfires like 2017's Lodgepole Complex[5], which burned about 270,000 acres of eastern Montana in an area that's seen some woody plant expansion, makes the dynamic all the more interesting and complex, he said. <br/>'The big question is which way is this going to go? Are these big fires that we've had in the last five years going to remove woody material and counter this woody plant expansion, or are we going to get more woody plants?' <br/>McWethy said he's hoping the historical record will provide clues as to what's in store. He looks at patterns playing out in time scales on the order of thousands or tens of thousands of years. <br/>In the nearer term, he said, he expects to see an expansion of wetlands with cattails, sedges, rushes and willows in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire, and 'very dynamic' ecosystem processes, including how carbon is stored in the system and how nutrients cycle through it, which in turn affects plants and animals. <br/>All of which complicates the work of natural resource professionals, McWethy said. <br/>'Even though we don't know exactly what the final trend will be, these changes are posing a lot of challenges for resource managers and fire managers,' he said. <br/>One of those challenges centers around the seasonal availability of water. One result of temperature increases wrought by climate change is that there's less snowpack to provide rivers with a steady supply of water, as noted in the 2017 Montana Climate Assessment[6]. Springtime precipitation that used to fall as snow often now falls as rain, which moves through a watershed more quickly. <br/>McWethy said 'providing a more equal distribution of water, especially during the dry season' will be a challenge for water managers. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://i0.wp.com/montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-04-at-9.07.44-AM.png?ssl=1As\">https://i0.wp.com/montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-04-at-9.07.44-AM.png?ssl=1As</url> of early March, 50% of Montana is in extreme or exceptional drought. Credit: U.S. Drought Monitor <br/>Montana is still in the grip of a stubborn drought[7] that's been alleviated, though not eliminated, by this winter's snowfall. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 50% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought[8] as of March 3. That's down from about 70% at the start of the water year, which runs Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Northwestern Montana is generally faring better than the rest of the state in both drought and snowpack[9]. <br/>Snowpack is higher in northwestern Montana than in central and southwest Montana. The northwestern corner of the state is also faring better than southwestern Montana in terms of streamflows. Credit: Natural Resources Conservation Service<br/>Streamflows around the state[10] are very much a mixed bag. Gauges monitored by the U.S. Geological Survey indicate that many rivers in the northwestern part of the state, including the Clark Fork and Flathead, are running within normal to above-normal ranges relative to previous March 3 measurements. But a handful of rivers in the southwestern corner of the state, including the Madison, Beaverhead and Ruby, are running much below normal to below normal. Data for most central and eastern Montana rivers is not currently available. They're listed as 'ice affected,' meaning the gauges can't take readings that represent current conditions. <br/> latest stories Study argues pro-duplex zoning would ease Montana housing crunch[11] A new report by the conservative Frontier Institute says Montana cities should roll back development restrictions to allow more mid-density housing in existing neighborhoods. It also calls for the state Legislature to step in if they don't. <br/><br/> Dangerous levels of lead were found in the water of about half the schools tested in Montana[12] Of the 222 schools that had turned in samples by mid-February, 110 had at least one water fixture with lead levels higher than 15 parts per billion, requiring that fixture to immediately be shut off. For many schools with high lead levels, finding the money to fix the problem will be a challenge. <br/><br/> Environmental groups seek relisting of Northern Rockies wolves[13] A collection of environmental groups has filed a new petition asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to instate immediate federal protections for Northern Rockies wolves, saying aggressive management measures in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming amount to the 'unlimited and unregulated taking of wolves' and run counter to a commitment the agency made in 2009 <br/><br/> Thank you for supporting Montana Free Press.  <br/>We rely on your donations to remain free and independent.

Ana Luz Diaz is on high alert. Uncontrolled forest fires are all too common in the Cerros de Jesus Biological Corridor near her home, but she is ready.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Diaz is a forest fire fighter and one of five women on a 30-member fire brigade. When the women joined the force, they were initially met with skepticism.</p><p>\"There is always that myth or macho thought that a woman cannot grab a machete, a back pump, a leaf blower, that she can't go up a big hill,\" says Diaz .</p><p>Like fighting fires, overcoming gender stereotypes is hard work. Diaz and her fellow brigadista are proving their mettle and gaining recognition for their contributions, particularly their effectiveness in \"finishing off\" forest fires.</p><p>Diaz says change is happening, but more must be done. Her colleague Melissa Aviles agrees: \"I want to be someone, to be seen, not be invisible. I want both men and women to see each other and the support that we too can give.\"</p><p>Women own less land and fewer and smaller farms than men, receive less financial support for them, and participate less in Costa Rica's payment for environmental services (PES) program.</p><p>Recognizing and supporting women's participation</p><p>A concerted effort is underway to better recognize, promote, and value the different ways women and men contribute to work related to the environment, forests, and climate change. The push is backed by national environmental policies that are helping to restore forest cover, as well as a specific and robust regulatory framework to promote gender equality.</p><p>\"Costa Rica is at the forefront of sustainability when it comes to human rights, social issues, and the environment,\" says Stavros Papageorgiou, World Bank Senior Natural Resources Management Specialist . \"The country has shown it has the institutions, legislation, and political will to build on programs and practices already in place and truly integrate gender into land use sector planning.\"</p><p>In 2019, Costa Rica became one of the few countries in the world to prepare a Gender Action Plan (GAP) for its national strategy on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (also known as REDD+) through enhanced forest management.</p><p>The GAP was developed with funding from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and in partnership with gender experts, civil society organizations, groups of indigenous women, and rural smallholder forest producers. It provides a clear path for guaranteeing financial resources, technical assistance, and monitoring to empower and support women so they can implement high-impact activities in the country's priority forest areas.</p><p>The GAP is helping to shape Costa Rica's Emission Reductions Payment Agreement (ERPA) with the FCPF. Once finalized and signed, with a likely contract value of $60 million, the agreement will reward communities for their REDD+ efforts. A percentage of the ERPA funds will be earmarked to support women's initiatives de-linked from the property rights requirements that PES schemes often entail.</p><p>\"This gender analysis is a real game changer. The evidence and data have empowered new thinking on how we motivate, support, and recognize women's contributions to sustainable productive landscape initiatives,\" explains Hector Arce Benavides, National REDD+ Strategy Director of FONAFIFO , the country's national forestry financing fund.</p><p>Seeing clearly through a gender lens</p><p>The GAP analysis found that many areas with a high percentage of women-owned farms overlap with areas marked by poverty. The analysis also found that women-owned farms overlap with priority zones for forest conservation and sustainable management, forest landscape and ecosystem restoration, and the promotion of low-carbon production systems. Yet, up until now, many of these efforts have not targeted women's participation or have simply left them out.</p><p>Regional consultations with rural communities further revealed that women's preferences, when it comes to activities they would like to carry out, are often in line with efforts that are promoted in the national plan for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. For example, many women are already engaged in reforestation, ecotourism, cocoa farming, nurseries, improved vegetable gardens, harvesting of non-timber forest products, and traditional indigenous practices such as low-carbon agroforestry systems. By further linking these activities with the National REDD+ Strategy and the emission reduction program's benefit sharing plan, the incomes and livelihoods of women and their families can be improved along with forest landscapes.</p><p>\"Looking at the land use sector through a gender lens has brought into focus important realities on the ground as well as significant opportunities for more strategic alignment of economic, social, and environmental goals,\" says Mara Elena Herrera, REDD+ Social Coordinator, FONAFIFO .</p><p>As the country builds back from the COVID-19 crisis, the GAP offers a solid foundation for holistic and inclusive action on a resilient recovery. Moving forward, Costa Rica is sharing its knowledge and lessons learned through the GAP with a training module on mainstreaming gender into forest and environmental initiatives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124003005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6115-C9R1-DYTH-G311-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 7, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is a textbook example of what climate scientists call a positive feedback mechanism,\" stresses David De Vleeschouwer, a postdoctoral researcher at MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen.</p><p>To reveal these kind of climate-carbon cycle feedback mechanisms under natural circumstances, David De Vleeschouwer and colleagues exploited isotopic data from deep-ocean sediment cores. \"Some of these cores contain sediments of up to 35 million years old. Despite their respectable age, these sediments carry a clear imprint of so-called Milankovi? cycles.</p><p>Milankovi? cycles relate to rhythmic changes in the shape of the Earth's orbit (eccentricity), as well as to the tilt (obliquity) and orientation (precession) of the Earth's rotational axis. Like an astronomical clockwork, Milankovi? cycles generate changes in the distribution of solar insolation over the planet, and thus provoke cadenced climate change\", explains David De Vleeschouwer. \"We looked at the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of microfossils within the sediment and first used the eccentricity, obliquity and precession cadences as geological chronometers. Then, we applied a statistical method to determine whether changes in one isotope system lead or lag variability in the other isotope.\"</p><p>His colleague Maximilian Vahlenkamp adds: \"When a common pattern in both isotope systems occurs just a little earlier in the carbon system compared to the oxygen isotope system, we call this a carbon-isotope lead. We then infer that the carbon cycle exerted control over the climate system at the time of sediment deposition.\"</p><p>Paleoclimatologists and paleoceanographers often use carbon isotopes as an indicator of carbon-cycle perturbations, and oxygen isotopes as a proxy for changes in global climate state. Changes in the isotopic composition of these deep-sea microfossils may indicate, for example, an increase in the continental carbon storage by land plants and soils, or global cooling with a growth of ice caps.</p><p>\"The systematic and time-continuous analysis of leads and lags between carbon cycle and climate constitutes the innovative character of this study. Our approach allows to sequence Earth's history at high resolution over the past 35 million years\", says Prof Heiko Palike. \"We show that the past 35 million years can be subdivided in three intervals, each with its specific climate-carbon cycle modus operandi.\" On average, the authors found oxygen isotopes to lead carbon isotope variations. This means that, under natural conditions, climate variations are largely regulating global carbon cycle dynamics.</p><p>However, the research team focused on times when the opposite was the case. Indeed, De Vleeschouwer and colleagues found a few examples of ancient periods during which the carbon cycle drove climate change on approximately 100,000-year timescales, just as it is the case now on much shorter timescales - \"but then of course without human intervention,\" states Palike.</p><p>During the oldest interval, between 35 and 26 million years ago, the carbon cycle took the lead over climate change mostly during periods of climate stability. \"Periods of climate stability in the geologic record often have an astronomical cause. When the Earth's orbit around the sun is close to a perfect circle, seasonal insolation extremes are truncated and more equable climates are enforced,\" explains David De Vleeschouwer.</p><p>\"Between 35 and 26 million years ago, such astronomical configuration would have been favourable for a temporal expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. We propose that under such a scenario, the intensity of glacial erosion and subsequent rock weathering increased. This is important, because the weathering of silicate rocks removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and thus ultimately controls the greenhouse effect.\"</p><p>But around 26 million years ago, the modus operandi radically changed. The carbon cycle took control over climate at times of climate volatility, not stability. \"We believe this change traces back to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains and a monsoon-dominated climate state. When seasonal insolation extremes are amplified through an eccentric Earth orbit, monsoons can become truly intense. Stronger monsoons permit more chemical weathering, the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere and thus a carbon-cycle control over climate.\"</p><p>The mechanisms proposed by the authors not only explain the observed patterns in carbon and oxygen isotopes, they also provide new ideas as to how the climate system and the carbon cycle interacted through time.</p><p>\"Some hypotheses need further testing with numerical climate and carbon cycle models, but the process-level understanding presented in this work is important because it provides a glimpse at the machinery of our planet under boundary conditions that are fundamentally different from today's,\" says De Vleeschouwer. Moreover, this work also provides scenarios that can be used to evaluate the ability of climate-carbon cycle models when they are pushed to the extreme scenarios of the geologic past.</p><p>Research paper</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202010062239125261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610Y-PR91-JC3D-Y180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 7, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>climate-and-carbon-cycle-in-perpetual-interaction</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp; GEOPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DD7B</classCode><className>PALEONTOLOGY &amp; PALEOBIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GX427</classCode><className>BREMEN, GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Now how can we overlook that?\" - Christopher Raffoul, a 22-year-old Beirut resident.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the blink of an eye: Buildings collapsed, cars were thrown into the air and a giant mushroom cloud rose above downtown Beirut, Lebanon. Hospitals were damaged and so overwhelmed by casualties that the wounded were being treated in veterinary clinics, pharmacies and parking lots. Due to this explosion on Tuesday, 330,000 are homeless, 5,000 are wounded and hundreds are likely dead. The explosion occurred at the Port of Beirut, near the heart of the city. Homes, stores, office buildings, universities, schools, hospitals and even the national grain silo have been destroyed. As the explosion ripped through Beirut, people on the island of Cyprus, 150 miles away, felt the effects of the blast. Seismographs registered it as a 3.3 magnitude earthquake.</p><p>The sad reality is that Lebanon was already facing devastation before the explosion happened, rendering it truly helpless after the blast. Prior to the pandemic, Lebanese took to the streets to demand the resignation of senior politicians due to pervasive corruption that has existed since the end of the civil war in the 1990s. This led to hyperinflation, famine and record-high unemployment, which have reduced this once proud nation to privation. The local currency has devalued by nearly 80 percent, driving critical imports like fuel, medicine and food out of reach for countless Lebanese. 45 percent of the population currently lives below the poverty line. Aid organizations like the World Bank forecast that this proportion could increase to 75 percent by December. Lebanon also imports all of its fuel and roughly 80 percent of its food - much of it through the now inoperable Port of Beirut. For the past several years, rolling blackouts have been egregiously common, leaving much of the country without electricity for up to 22 hours a day.</p><p>It is a cruel irony that, in a nation plagued by shortages of food and medicine, the explosion destroyed the national grain silo, essential medical supply warehouses and severely damaged hospitals and pharmacies. The Lebanese, in the aftermath of the explosion, understandably ignored social distancing precautions to seek and provide help. Even though the race to save lives eclipses COVID-19 precautions, the Lebanese are dreading the imminent spike in cases that their healthcare system is woefully unprepared to combat.</p><p>For nearly six years, 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate have been stored improperly in the densely populated capital. It was this depot of ammonium nitrate that somehow detonated, wreaking havoc on an unimaginable scale. The bureaucrats are currently pointing fingers, but the problem goes beyond any individual. The mismanagement of the country is systemic. While one can never quantify the suffering caused by the blast, experts are estimating it destroyed $10 billion to $15 billion worth of property. For a nation already in economic freefall, ruled by an incompetent political class, this is nothing short of ruinous.</p><p>We understand that the coronavirus crisis has stretched many budgets to their breaking point. There is also no shortage of worthy causes in the United States that desperately need contributions. That being said, Lebanon has been going from tragedy to tragedy with no light at the end of the tunnel. While the international media outlets will inevitably leave Beirut and turn their cameras towards the next disaster, the hard work of healing and rebuilding will go on for years. The emotional scars of this calamity will never fade; today's Lebanese children will now carry the same pain their parents did from their own childhoods riddled with memories of the civil war. The streets that they knew and the houses they grew up in will never be the same.</p><p>This is a cry for help to the international community. Since the Lebanese cannot rely on their own government, international support is their only hope. Due to the collapse of the Lebanese currency, American dollars will do a disproportionate amount of good - approximately eight times more than they would have in the past. Just as Cornell came together as a community in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, we hope to see the same kind of support for this humanitarian emergency. The LebaneseRed Cross has been vital in responding to this colossal challenge. Donations can be made here. If you cannot contribute funds, your thoughts and prayers are always welcome and appreciated.</p><p>\"This country lives in my heart, so I am heartbroken.\" - Marya Wahidi, a 22-year-old medical student at the American University of Beirut.</p><p>Charles Mouaikel '20</p><p>Nadia Samaha '20</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4652090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JD-KMC1-DY7P-T3PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cornell Daily Sun: Cornell University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 8, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ithaca</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

The story takes place about four years after Isla Nublar was destroyed in \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\"</p><p>Dinosaurs naturally have gotten loose again, and they're mad, hungry and everywhere-in the tropics and deserts, swimming in frozen lakes and hunting in the narrow streets of charming European cities.

So here's your guide to the large lizards, amphibious animals, cloned carnivores and benign behemoths of the Jurassic Park series, and what to look for in the new film. Don't worry, no spoilers.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Allosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Allosaurus</emphasis> was a large bipedal predator with dozens of sharp, serrated teeth. It was about 28 feet long. At the top of the food chain, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Allosaurus</emphasis> probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs, and maybe even other predators.</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Allosaurus</emphasis> appears in \"Jurassic World Dominion\" rampaging through a city.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ankylosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Greek for \"fused lizard,\" this armored herbivore is protected from carnivores by thick plates on its back, two rows of spikes, large horns and a powerful club tail. It was over 5 feet tall, up to 35 feet long and weighed up to 6.5 tons. They were last seen in \"Fallen Kingdom.\"</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apatosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>In Michael Crichton's first novel, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apatosaurus</emphasis> is the very first group of dinosaurs seen on the island. At some point in the \"Dominion,\" an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apatosaurus</emphasis> is seen wandering in a snow-covered lumber yard, according to Fandom. </p><p>This herbivore stood 15 feet high and up to 90 feet long, and weighed 20 to 36 tons.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Atrociraptor</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>The only known specimen of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Atrociraptor</emphasis> was found in 1995 in Alberta, Canada. It had teeth, an unusually short and tall skull, and was about 6.5 feet long and weighed about 33 pounds. According to Fandom, the film will feature four of these, with different coloring.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baryonyx</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>The name<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Baryonyx</emphasis> means \"heavy claw\" and refers to the animal's large claw on the first finger. It was 25 to 33 feet long and weighed between 1.2 and 1.7 tons. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baryonyx</emphasis> was discovered in 1983 in England.</p><p>Scientists think the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Baryonyx</emphasis> might have been bipedal and ate fish.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brachiosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>This enormous herbivore stood up to 70 feet high and weighed up to 56 tons. Brachiosaurus' size is its protection. From the first movie, this is the \"veggie-saurus.\" Fossils were first discovered in Colorado in 1903.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Camarasaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>This sauropod replaces the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apatosaurus</emphasis> in some editions of the first novel.</p><p>An herbivore, it was the most common of the giant sauropods in North America, fossils were found in Colorado and Utah. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Camarasaurus </emphasis>was about 49 feet long, with the largest species, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C. supremus,</emphasis> up to 75 feet long and weighing as much as 51.8 tons.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Carnotaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>At the beginning of \"The Lost World,\" a pair of these carnivores attack Richard Levine and kill his guide, Diego. In that film, they are capable of changing skin color like a chameleon. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Carnotaurus</emphasis> stood about 9 feet high and 29 feet long. Look for it in \"Dominion.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Carnotaurus</emphasis> is known from a single well-preserved skeleton found in 1984 in Argentina. Its name means \"meat-eating bull,\" an allusion to the animal's bull-like horns.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Compsognathus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>These small dinosaurs briefly make an appearance in the second film in 1997, in which a pack of several <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Compsognathus</emphasis> killed Dieter Stark.</p><p>Paleontologists have found two well-preserved fossils of these little guys, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. They are estimated to have weighed between 1.8 and 7.7 pounds, about the size of a Chihuahua.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Corythosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Specimens of this 27-foot-long herbivore have been found in Canada. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Corythosaurus</emphasis> probably lived in a woodland forest, and might have occasionally wandered into swampy areas. One specimen was found preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity, including conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Corythosaurus</emphasis> hasn't been seen since \"Jurassic Park III.\"</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dilophosaurus</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Slender and lightly built, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dilophosaurus</emphasis> was about the size of a brown bear. Three skeletons were discovered in northern Arizona in 1940. The largest known specimen weighed about 880 pounds and was 23 feet long.</p><p>Scientists suggest the creature's crest was for visual display for attracting a mate, or for temperature regulation. Not seen since the original film, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dilophosaurus</emphasis> may make an appearance in \"Dominion.\"</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dimorphodon</emphasis></emphasis><br/></p><p>The 4-pound 3-foot-long winged <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dimorphodons</emphasis> made a brief appearance in \"Jurassic World,\" where they are freed from the aviary by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Indominus rex</emphasis> and soon wreak havoc on the tourists alongside the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pteranodon</emphasis>.</p><p>It had a wingspan of about 5 feet, but studies show that the animal was actually a rather poor flyer. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dimorphodon</emphasis> probably relied on frantic short flights, unable to fly for long distances and only taking to the air as a last resort.

It was one of the country's deadliest civilian disasters. The stampede began when large numbers of people thronged a narrow tunnel-like passage during the event, according to witnesses and video footage. People began falling on top of each other near the end of the walkway, as they descended slippery metal stairs, witnesses said. </p><p>One of the injured, Avraham Leibe, told Israeli public broadcaster Kan that a crush of people trying to descend the mountain caused a 'general bedlam' on a slippery metal slope followed by stairs. 'Nobody managed to halt,' he said from a hospital bed. 'I saw one after the other fall.' Video footage showed large numbers of people, most of them black-clad ultra-Orthodox men, squeezed in the tunnel. Initial reports and witnesses said police barricades had prevented people from exiting quickly. The stampede occurred during the celebrations of Lag BaOmer at Mount Meron, the first mass religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted nearly all restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The country has seen cases plummet since launching one of the world's most successful vaccination campaigns late last year. Lag BaOmer draws tens of thousands of people, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jews, each year to honor Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, a 2nd century sage and mystic who is believed to be buried there. Large crowds traditionally light bonfires, pray and dance as part of the celebrations. This year, media estimated the crowd at about 100,000 people. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron around midday Friday, said it was 'one of the worst disasters that has befallen the state of Israel' and offered condolences to the families. He said Sunday would be a day of national mourning. Netanyahu was jeered by dozens of ultra-Orthodox protesters, who blamed the government and police for the tragedy. Velvel Brevda, a rabbi who witnessed the stampede, accused police of putting up barriers that had prevented people from leaving through exits that were usually open in past years. 'Where should we leave from?' he said. 'And the officers who were there couldn't care less.' He said the government was responsible for the deaths of 'beautiful holy Jews that were killed here for no reason whatsoever, just to prove a point that they're in charge of this place instead of the Orthodox Jews being in charge.' At least 45 people were killed, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, with four people remaining in critical condition. In the immediate aftermath of the stampede, rescue workers collected the bodies, wrapped them in white covers and laid them side by side on the ground at the site. Bodies were later taken to Israel's central forensic pathology institute for identification. Ultra Orthodox Jews make their way out of Mt.

(AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner) Efforts were still under way to identify some of the victims and connect families with missing relatives. In the night from Thursday to Friday, cell phone coverage around Mount Meron had collapsed for hours and emergency hotlines were overwhelmed with phone calls. In the overwhelmingly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, officials were working with healthcare workers to connect the families of the missing. 'The picture is slowly becoming clearer,' Kivi Hess, a municipal spokesman, told Channel 13 TV. In a race against time, a number of funerals were to be held before sundown Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath when burials do not take place. The country's figurehead president, Reuven Rivlin, lit 45 memorial candles to honor the dead. The death toll at Mount Meron exceeded the 44 people killed in a 2010 forest fire. That had previously been believed to be the deadliest civilian tragedy in the country's history. Zaki Heller, spokesman for the Magen David Adom rescue service, said 150 people had been hurt in the stampede. Heller told Israel Army Radio that 'no one had ever dreamed' something like this could happen. 'In one moment, we went from a happy event to an immense tragedy,' he said. The Justice Ministry said the police's internal investigations department was launching a probe into possible criminal misconduct by officers. The deadly stampede was also bound to have political reverberations at a time of great uncertainty following an inconclusive March election, the fourth in two years. Netanyahu has so far been unsuccessful in forming a governing coalition, and his time for doing so runs out early next week. His political rivals, including former allies bent on ending his 12-year rule, will then get a chance to try to cobble together an alliance from a patchwork of left-wing, centrist and hawkish parties. Netanyahu needs the continued support of ultra-Orthodox parties, his long-time allies, if he wants to keep faint hopes alive of staying in power. Israeli media reported Friday that earlier this month, Netanyahu assured ultra-Orthodox politicians in a meeting that the Lag BaOmer celebrations would take place with few limitations. The reports said this decision was supported by Cabinet ministers and police, despite objections by health officials who warned of a risk of renewed coronavirus infections. Last year, observances on Mount Meron were limited due to the pandemic. At the start of this year's celebrations, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana, police chief Yaakov Shabtai and other top officials visited the event and met with police, who had deployed 5,000 extra forces to maintain order. Condolences were sent by foreign leaders and diplomats, including the U.S. charge d'affaires. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote on Twitter that his 'thoughts are with the Israeli people and those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.' The European Union conveyed 'deepest condolences to families and friends of the victims' and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.

By Robert Dugan Robert Dugan is chair of the Placer County Water Agency Board of Directors and a board member of the Sacramento Regional Water Authority, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:District4@pcwa.net\">District4@pcwa.net</email> [1].; Jeff Harris, Special to CalMatters Jeff Harris is vice mayor of the city of Sacramento and a board member of the Sacramento Regional Water Authority, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jsharris@cityofsacramento.org\">jsharris@cityofsacramento.org</email> .;The uncontrolled wildfires that raged across California this year devastated lives, homes, forests and entire watersheds. </p><p>We set a dubious record for most acres burned in a single year: 4.1 million[2] and counting.It takes a long time to recover from such intense fires. In 2014, the King Fire[3] burned 97,000 acres of vital American River watershed in Northern California, and we're still managing the consequences.As representatives of urban and rural communities in this watershed, we appreciate that our lives are interconnected by the effects of wildfire. We understand how uncontrolled fire in our headwater forests can trigger cascading negative impacts on our water supplies, environment, recreational resources and economy - from the Sierra foothills to Sacramento's urban core into the Delta and beyond. We also know that the way we have historically managed our forests must change.Today, millions of acres of forest, too crowded with trees and brush, are primed for catastrophic fire with little or no resilience to accommodate our changing climate. For this, we can blame last-century practices of extinguishing every forest fire as rapidly as possible. Lightning-caused fires and burning practices of indigenous people, which mitigated the risk of mega-fire, were stopped in the early 1900s. This allowed underbrush and small trees to crowd the park-like spaces between big trees that once defined our forests.Forests can again function as they did historically and be more resilient to climate change, if Californians make several major shifts:Local agencies must take the lead on forest restoration efforts. State and federal agencies can provide vital money and technical support. But the pressure to act must arise from residents, elected officials and conservation organizations in fire-threatened watersheds. Also, each of us needs to accept that small-scale, controlled fires are a natural condition in California. After all, historical accounts tell us that smoky skies in the late summer were common long before the state was settled.We must support more funding for forest thinning and prescribed fire. Case in point: The King Fire turned sections of the American River watershed into a virtual moonscape. Later, tons of ash, logs and soil eroded into hydropower and water supply facilities owned by Placer County Water Agency[4], threatening storage capacity and water quality for not just our Sacramento region but the Valley and Southern California as well.Ever since, the Placer County Water Agency, Placer County, The Nature Conservancy, U.S. Forest Service and other partners have progressed on a 20,000-acre forest restoration project at French Meadows Reservoir, a vital water storage facility on the American River's Middle Fork. The project's goal is to use small, prescribed fires to eliminate overcrowded trees and brush that could stoke an inferno. Getting there has required six years of planning and hard work to mechanically remove undergrowth - using saws and tractors - so that a prescribed burn could occur safely.Ultimately, we estimate the total project will cost $18 million. That's a bargain when considering that federal officials spent $117 million fighting the King Fire in 2014 and the countless tons of carbon that was released into the atmosphere. Keep tabs on the latest California policy and politics news   Much more is needed statewide to address the tinderboxes like French Meadows that exist throughout California - up to $10 billion according to forest health experts[5]. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature were unsuccessful in their attempts earlier this year to boost funding for forest health projects. It's imperative that funding succeed in the year ahead.That may require broad public support for a bond measure - your support - for the many public benefits these projects could yield. For example, restoring the natural, open condition of our forests is more accommodating for recreation and native species. Remaining trees can grow bigger, making them more resistant to fires. And avoiding catastrophic fires prevents pollution caused by massive carbon release, post-fire storm runoff and sediment flows that shrink capacity in downstream reservoirs and impact cold water management to protect fisheries.The fires of 2020 showed all of us how daily life is affected by uncontrolled wildfire. Our long summer of record heat, deadly wildfires[6] and smoky skies may have left many Californians feeling hopeless about the state we cherish. But the future is actually very bright, if we turn our focus to the forests.

Forest loss impacts not only the environment, but also approximately 1.3 billion forest communities and Indigenous Peoples who rely on forests for their livelihoods.As advocates and companies turn their attention to engaging and enabling forest communities as stewards of the forest, as well as tackling climate change and deforestation more broadly, working together can achieve more significant results, experts say. New initiative brings companies and communities together as 'Forest Allies' In addition to supplying many of the products we use in our everyday lives and providing critical benefits like carbon sequestration and water regulation, forests support approximately 1.3 billion forest communities and Indigenous Peoples who rely on them for their livelihoods. Forest Allies, a new initiative from the Rainforest Alliance[1], brings companies together with forest-dependent communities to tackle deforestation and resilience issues. </p><p>Through their work to maintain and restore forests and the biodiversity within them, Forest Allies prioritizes helping forest communities adapt to climate change and improve economic livelihoods while elevating their expertise in partnerships to implement sustainable forest management at scale.&#x2028; 'Collaboration is key,' Samantha Morrissey, forest products sector lead for the Rainforest Alliance, told TriplePundit. 'We often see our partners across various sectors sourcing from the same landscapes and regions experiencing similar challenges, but [they] often lack the opportunity to come together to learn from each other, pool resources and co-create solutions.' Further, even as companies that rely on forests for their supply chains become more aggressive about developing strategies around sustainability and forestry, their efforts are somewhat limited if they can't engage the full range of local stakeholders. 'Very small companies with limited supply chains do have the opportunity to engage directly with their suppliers and ask these important questions' related to implementing sustainable practices and building policies based on local needs, Morrissey explained. 'But large international companies continue to struggle to gain the visibility within their supply chains needed to engage in this way, and given the scale and size of their sourcing footprints, such an exercise would be prohibitive in terms of time and resource intensive.' To address this disconnect, the Rainforest Alliance compiled a learning assessment and inventory based on their experience working with community forest enterprises and formed the Forest Allies community of practice. The aim of these efforts is to enable all actors across industries, sectors and the supply chain, regardless of size, to contribute to the improved health of a region by enabling community forest management at scale. The Forest Allies initiative leverages the Accountability Framework[2], and requires members are to align their policies, strategies, and activities with it. The Framework is a set of norms to help companies define and operationalize deforestation-free supply chains alongside a common approach to monitoring, verifying, and reporting their progress. Overall, Forest Allies members want to reorient stakeholder conversations to better balance top-down approaches, such as certifications and corporate policies, with a bottom-up approach that centers communities, which they say can help redefine what business-as-usual looks like. Corporate decision-making is historically focused on prioritizing time, quality, cost and profits, leaving inadequate space for collaboration and partnerships that take time and resources to build. 'Now, we have seen an emergence of the dedicated consumer and the 'impact corporation' where decisions are made not only based on time, quality and costs, but also in consideration of impacts and externalities,' Morrissey told us. 'This shift requires collaboration and partnerships in order to be successful, because the challenges we face are too great for any one company to address alone.' It takes a village Corporate commitments for individual supply chains are no longer enough to tackle deforestation and the concomitant problems of human rights violations and poverty. Those commitments need to align with 'public-sector measures that improve land sector governance, enable sustainable rural development, and create incentives to conserve forests,' Morrissey said. The inextricable link between the forest, the communities that depend on it, and the corporations that rely on it for their supply chain needs is clear. As such, solutions to maintaining the health of the forest must also address the health and well-being of forest-dependent people and enterprises. As climate change continues to affect forests, adaptation and resilience measures must be socially just and include responsible forest management and land stewardship in order to protect and strengthen the bonds of interdependence between people and nature. Morrissey noted the positive impacts of such measures in forested areas of Guatemala and Mexico, where the Rainforest Alliance works with local associations, governments, industry and communities to reduce forest fire risk through improved forest management. Companies including Procter &amp;#38; Gamble, a longtime partner of the Rainforest Alliance, are also making more stringent commitments[3] to work beyond their supply chains to improve the resilience of forest-dependent communities. Companies including Procter &amp;#38; Gamble and Kingfisher are already engaged[4] with Forest Allies, and Rainforest Alliance is still actively recruiting[5] new corporate members&#x2028;. Continuing the work to protect and restore forests The Rainforest Alliance and its partners are far from the only groups working to improve forest management by engaging corporate and local stakeholders. Regardless of who is spearheading the effort, the key to an effective, sustainable solution is understanding the root causes of the issues on the ground and aligning goals and solutions accordingly. For example, Morrissey referenced a partner that wanted to use only pesticide-free natural rubber, and instead of limiting their suppliers through policies, visited smallholder rubber farms to understand why pesticides are used and learned that the long grass between the trees hid snakes, so farmers used pesticides to keep the grass back. As a simple solution the partner paid for the grass to be mown. '[Companies] can't go out and mow all of their suppliers' lawns, but they can invest in community forest management and support that investment through meaningful engagement in our community of practice and the partnerships that result,' she told us. In the end, long-term conservation of any forest must recognize that the best guardians are those who depend on the forest for their lives and livelihoods. Collaborating from the top-down and the bottom-up means that when stakeholders meet in the middle, their solutions are likely to be more equitable and comprehensive.

Through changes in the climate, anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter fire dynamics. Here we compile satellite (19 and 32 years) and ground-based (90 years) burned area datasets, climate and weather observations, and simulated fuel loads for Australian forests. Burned area in Australia\u2019s forests shows a linear positive annual trend but an exponential increase during autumn and winter. The mean number of years since the last fire has decreased consecutively in each of the past four decades, while the frequency of forest megafire years (&gt;1 Mha burned) has markedly increased since 2000. The increase in forest burned area is consistent with increasingly more dangerous fire weather conditions, increased risk factors associated with pyroconvection, including fire-generated thunderstorms, and increased ignitions from dry lightning, all associated to varying degrees with anthropogenic climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The degree to which wildfire activity in Australia is affected by climate change is not well quantified. Here, the authors show that the frequency of forest\u00a0fires and the area burned have increased significantly over recent decades, mainly due to an increase in dangerous fire weather conditions through warmer temperature and circulation changes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>The extraordinary forest fires in Australia in 2019 and 20201 have brought further interest in detecting changes in fire activity, the possible role of anthropogenic climate change and their likely future trends both in Australia and globally2\u20136.</p><p>Terrestrial ecosystems in Australia are among the most fire prone in the world, with fire regimes varying widely7,8. Fire activity is dominated by savanna and rangeland fires in the northern and western parts of the continent characterized by fire return intervals of less than 5 years7,9. Forests in the east and south have fire return times of decades to more than a century, with subtropical and tropical forests in the northeast burning rarely or not at all9. Fire, including cultural burns by indigenous people, has shaped the function and structure of most Australian ecosystems for millennia10,11.</p><p>Against this background of fire activity, Australia\u2019s mean temperature has increased by 1.4 \u00b0C since 1910 with a rapid increase in extreme heat events, while rainfall has declined in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, particularly during the cool half of the year12\u201314. These changes can affect the four components that must simultaneously come together for fire to occur: biomass production, its availability to burn (fuel loads), fire weather, and ignition7, making Australian forests vulnerable and sensitive to changes in fire activity.</p><p>Previous studies showed increased fire danger due to changes in weather conditions over past decades in Australia5,15,16, climate change fingerprinting to individual fire events and trends17\u201319, and predicted increases in fire danger under future climate change due to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases2,20,21. Although these studies indicate more dangerous weather conditions for wildfires in a warmer world, studies also suggest that trends due to climate change might not be clearly detectable until later in the coming decades owing to the high natural variability and extremes of the Australian climate4,22\u201324.</p><p>Fuel loads and trends, as effected by climate, human activity and time since the last disturbance, also play a role in determining fire risk25,26. This link is a central motivation for using prescribed burning to reduce fuel availability27, which in Australia is managed through changes in the frequency of prescribed burns28. Although there is some debate on their value to reduce fire risk29, particularly during extreme fire weather conditions2,30, fuel loads and their distribution and structure are key determinants of fire spread, intensity and severity7.</p><p>Here we analyze trends of the burned area in forest ecosystems in Australia, which are dominated by temperate forests extending over the southern and eastern regions of the continent. We use a high-resolution (1.1 km x 1.1 km) burned area satellite record available based on NOAA-AVHRR (32 years), the NASA-MODIS burned area at 500 m resolution (19 years), and the fire histories from State and Territory government agencies (90 years). In addition, we analyze trends of nine wildfire risk factors and indices that relate to characteristics of fuel loads, fire weather, extreme fire behaviour, and ignition, which together with the burned area enable us to infer the causal influence of climate change on fire activity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trends in area burned</emphasis></p><p>At a continental scale, total annual burned area (fire year defined as July to June to include the Austral summer of December to February) using the NOAA-AVHRR dataset (\u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data), significantly increased over the past 32 years albeit with large interannual variability (Fig. 1a; Linear fit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.04, Supplementary Table 1). The high variability is in part driven by large-scale modes of atmospheric and oceanic variability such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annual Mode31,32 that influence fire weather conditions16,22. Nine out of the 11 fire years, each with more than 500,000 km2 (&gt;50 Mha) burned, occurred since 2000.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burned area (km2) for each fire year (July to June) from 1988 to 2019.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Whole of continental Australia including Tasmania, linear fit; (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) Australian forests, linear fit; and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) Australian forests for the Austral autumn/winter seasons (March to August), exponential fit (regressions in Supplementary Table 1). Data: AVHRR-Landgate (1988\u20132019, dots) and MODIS (2002\u20132019, triangles). Regressions are calculated using AVHRR-Landgate, and MODIS is shown for comparison.</p><p>Forest ecosystems also show increased burned area over time (Fig. 1b, linear fit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.02, Supplementary Table 1; Fig. 2). The increasing trend is statistically significant with and without the 2019 fire year, indicating a robust increasing trend even before the extraordinary large burned area of that year (Supplementary Table 1). Forests in Australia experienced an annual average increase of 350% in burned area between the first (1988-2001) and second (2002-2018) half of the record, and an increase of 800% when including 2019. The 2019 fire year burned about three times (60,345 km2) the area of any previous year in the 32-year AVHRR-Landgate record (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 1, \u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area). The burned area of the 2019 fire year was estimated at 71,772 km2 based on State and Territory agencies (NIAFED) and 54,852 km2 based on NASA-MODIS, with an average for the three products of 62,323 \u00b1 8,631. Ten out of eleven fire years with at least 5000 km2 (&gt;0.5 Mha) burned have occurred since 2001. These trends are broadly consistent across the three burned area products (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Monthly burned forest area for fire years (July to June).</emphasis></p><p>Data: AVHRR-Landgate (1988\u20132019).</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wildfire burned area by states and territory in forest ecosystems for the 1930 to 2019 fire years.</emphasis></p><p>New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory (dark blue), Victoria (red), Queensland (light blue), South Australia (black), Western Australia (violet) and Tasmania (green). Data for 1930\u20132018 stacked bars are State and Territory agencies fire histories, supplemented with MODIS for Queensland in 2016\u20132018. Data for 2019 fire year are National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset (NIAFED) by States and Territories (stacked bar), AVRHRR-Landgate (filled triangle), and MODIS (filled circle). See \u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data.</p><p>We find a positive exponential trend of burned area in forest ecosystems during the cool season months of the Austral autumn and winter (March to August), with a mean growth rate of 14% yr-1 (Fig. 1c; exponential fit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.001; 9% increase without the 2019 fire season; Supplementary Table 1). These results indicate an extension of the fire season into the cooler months of the year, with more than a five-fold increase in the annual mean burned area in winter and three-fold increase in autumn between the first and second half of the studied period. However, spring and summer contributed about 10 times more to the increase in burned area than autumn and winter (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). All seasonal linear trends were highly significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value &lt; 0.001), and with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.07 for the summer season. The seasonal fractions of burned area for the 32-year period are 66% in summer, 24% in spring, 7% in autumn and 3% in winter.</p><p>Along the latitudinal increasing temperature gradient from South to North (Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland), we find that the largest relative growth of burned area between the early (1988\u20132002) and later (2003-2019) periods of the record occurred in the southern coolest parts of the forest distribution (Tasmania) and the northern warmest parts of the forest distribution (Queensland), with Queensland showing the largest absolute difference of the two.</p><p>The AVHRR-Landgate data predominantly detects wildfires and misses low-intensity fires, including most prescribed (planned) burning33, suggesting the trends presented here are very unlikely to be affected by changes in prescribed burning (\u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data). This result is further corroborated by the lack of trends in the annual area of prescribed burning (see section below Fire risk factors and fuel load).</p><p>Fire histories compiled from State and Territory agencies (\u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data), suggest that the extent of burned area for the 2019 fire year was also unprecedented since the 1930s when most agencies began to collect annual records (Fig. 3). Out of four forest megafire years (defined as the top 10 percentile years with most burned area) that have occurred since 1930, each with over 10,000 km2 (1 Mha) of burned area (1930, 2002, 2006, 2019), three occurred since 2000. Historical records show that no other forest megafire years occurred during the 1900s but that a large fire year occurred in Victoria in 185134. Further disaggregation into States and Territories, and wildfires and prescribed burning is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.</p><p>The increasing trend in annual burned area, and the exceptional 2019 fire year, become all the more significant against a concurrent diminishing of forest extent available to burn due to land clearing for pasture and agriculture35, and increasing bushfire firefighting capacity in Australia36,37.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Years since the last fire</emphasis></p><p>We further investigate trends in increasing burned area with an analysis of the number of years since the last wildfire (YSLF). The longer time series of the fire history records from State and Territory agencies enable us to construct a gridded database of wildfires at 250 m resolution to analyze decadal changes in the number of YSLF for all pixels that have burned at least once (\u201cMethods\u201d: Years since the last fire). The analysis shows that 48.8% of all forest area has burned at least once since the 1930s. The burned fraction of the total area for each of the forest classes consistent with the Australian National Forest Inventory (\u201cMethods\u201d: Forest extent and types) varied widely: eucalypt low-forest 61.1%, eucalypt tall-forest 60.6%, eucalypt medium-forest 58.2%, coastal non-eucalypt 54.3%, and rainforest 11.1%. Thus, YSLF estimates presented here do not represent a fire frequency for specific region or forest type, but they are correlated, as they have been estimated by a combination of observations and expert knowledge elsewhere9.</p><p>For context, some of the dominant vegetation types such as tall eucalypt forests have typical fire intervals of 20 to 100 years with extreme cases with more than 100 years9. Lower stature eucalypt forests have typical fire intervals between 5 and 20 years with extreme cases with a range between 20 and 100 years9. Tropical forests have fire return intervals above 100 years9.</p><p>The YSLF declined over the past four decades with decadal means (\u00b1SD) (all forests that had burned at least once since 1930s) of 70.6 \u00b1 1.1 years, 68.1 \u00b1 1.0 years, 53.2 \u00b1 7.8 years, and 39.8 \u00b1 8.1 years for the decades of 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively (Fig. 4; continental figures in Supplementary Fig. 5). YSLF values for the last four decades of the record are the most robust due to the large amount of data from which they are estimated (cumulative), and therefore are the focus of this analysis. Fig. 4 reveals areas with rapidly declining YSLF, with some regions in Victoria with YSLF below 20 years. At the State and Territory level, the decade of 2010s shows a range from 46 \u00b1 21 in Queensland to 33 \u00b1 4 in Victoria, with a minimum of 18 \u00b1 4 years for the Australian Capital Territory whose forests were largely burned in 2003 and again in 2020 (Supplementary Table 2).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number of years since the last wildfire (decadal mean) for forested areas.</emphasis></p><p>Analysis based on forested areas that have burned at least once since fire records began in the 1930s for most states.

Data: State and Territory fire histories.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire risk factors and links to climate change</emphasis></p><p>There are four components that drive fire activity: weather that influences fire spread, ignition sources, biomass accumulation (fuel loads), and dryness of fuel loads (fuel availability)2,7. In the next three sections we address each of these four factors and show trends of various indices and quantities which we link back to changes in fire risk over the past 40 years.</p><p>We use a daily dataset of McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) values gridded throughout Australia15. This index is specifically developed to indicate weather conditions across the \u201cDanger\u201d spectrum associated with wildfires in Australian forests38. It integrates a combination of key weather factors known to influence the severity of wildfires including wind speed, humidity, temperature, and fuel moisture deficit, which is calculated from antecedent rainfall and temperature.</p><p>Multi-decadal changes towards more dangerous fire weather (as indicated by FFDI) are occurring for most of Australia (Fig. 5a). The largest increases occur in the southeast, including in association with increased temperatures (Fig. 5d) and decreased rainfall (Fig. 5e) in that region, as others have reported before2,5,15,39. Temperature influences fire behaviour in a number of ways. First, through relative humidity (vapour pressure deficit) and its effect on the absorption of energy by the atmosphere and on the moisture content of vegetation. Second, by influencing atmospheric stability based on temperature lapse rates and humidity profiles, which influences the risk of extreme wildfire events including those that generate new thunderstorms20,21,40. Third, through its contribution to the occurrence of heat waves18, and fourth by influencing the speed and intensity of drought development41,42, along with other factors such as wind speed, specific humidity and soil moisture.Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change factors associated with wildfire weather and activity.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Near-surface fire weather conditions based on the Forest Fire Danger Index, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) mid-tropospheric fire weather conditions based on the C-Haines Index, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) dry lightning conditions as key factors for ignitions, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) daily maximum temperature, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) annual rainfall deficit and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) soil moisture (0\u201323 cm) associated with dryness of the forest system.

Grey areas in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) denote areas with insufficient data availability.</p><p>Over the last four decades, a trend has been observed towards drier conditions during the cooler months of the year (e.g., April to October) in many parts of southeastern Australia (Fig. 5e for annual change). This has been associated with a strengthening of the subtropical ridge and a decrease in rainfall from fronts and cyclones13,14,43. The observed trends are consistent with projected future declines in cool season rainfall in the 21st century from global climate models, and are stronger than those produced in historical simulations for the period 1950-200544,45. Reduced Austral spring and winter rainfall influences the fuel moisture leading into the fire season, with drier fuels in spring being associated with a trend towards an earlier start to the fire season particularly in southeast Australia in recent decades15,16,24.</p><p>In addition to the FFDI, which is based on weather conditions near the surface, we used the Continuous Haines (C-Haines) index46 to represent dangerous weather conditions for wildfires based on higher levels of the troposphere (\u201cMethods\u201d: Fire weather indices and climate/weather variables). The C-Haines index is used to indicate a high chance of extreme wildfires such as those with thunderstorm formation in fire plumes (generally referred to as pyrocumulonimbus cloud, termed pyroCb)21,40,46. PyroCbs are associated with extreme dangerous fire behaviour, including erratic and strong gusty winds near the surface and generating lightning in the fire plume that can ignite additional fires far ahead of the main fire front47,48.</p><p>Long-term changes in the C-Haines Index have occurred over the last four decades in many parts of Australia (Fig. 5b), with higher values representing more dangerous conditions for extreme wildfire events, particularly over forest ecosystems of southeast Australia. This is consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated significant increases in C-Haines Index in recent decades, particularly for regions of southern Australia40. High C-Haines index occurred in previous wildfire disasters in southeast Australia including during the Black Summer fires in 2019/2020, the Black Saturday fires in Victoria in 2009, and the Canberra fires in 200340,49. Often high C-Haines values are accompanied by high FFDI values (Supplementary Table 3), but there are exceptions with a notable case for the Canberra fires in 2003 where the C-Haines had a higher percentile value than FFDI, although both were high40.</p><p>Modelling shows that increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions can increase the C-Haines in some regions including southeastern Australia20,21. These climatological changes are primarily associated with an increase in the moisture-related component of the C-Haines (representing increased dewpoint depression at 850 hPa) rather than its stability component as seen based on historical reanalysis data40 and projections of future climate20. Increased dewpoint depression (and similarly relative humidity or vapour pressure deficit) is primarily caused by increased temperatures, but countered to some degree by an increase in atmospheric moisture content that is as expected consequence of a warmer world50.</p><p>Fire ignition factors in Australia include multiple anthropogenic and natural sources. The primary natural cause is lightning, particularly that known as \u201cdry lightning\u201d, which occurs when the lightning is not accompanied by substantial rainfall. A threshold of rainfall of about 2.5 mm is used to define dry lightning. Rainfall less than this quantity on a day with lightning is associated with a higher than average chance that the lightning will result in a wildfire51. Lightning can be responsible for more than 50% of the area burned in some regions of Australia including the temperate forest regions of southeast Australia52. Although lightning observations are not available in a homogenous form over many decades, environments associated with dry lightning events show an increased frequency of occurrence in recent decades in near-coastal regions of southeast Australia (Fig. 5c)53. Specifically, there is an increase of about 50% in the frequency of occurrence of those environments for the recent period of 2000\u20132016 compared with the previous two decades of 1980\u20131999.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burned area and fire weather</emphasis></p><p>To understand the influence of fire weather on the observed trends in burned areas in forest ecosystems, we use uni- and multi-variate regression analyses with the fire risks factors of FFDI \u2265 25, FFDI \u2265 50, C-Haines and dry lightning as predictor variables. Note that we find no significant relationships with biomass variables (see section Fire risk factors and fuel loads, and Fig. S7), and therefore they are not included in this analysis.</p><p>We found both FFDI equal or exceeding 25 (Very High fire danger classification starts at FFDI \u2265 25) and equal or exceeding 50 (Severe fire danger classification starts at FFDI \u2265 50) to be significantly increasing over the past four decades for the forest areas (Fig. 6a,b; linear fit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.01, Supplementary Table 1). The five years with most severe or greater fire danger (FFDI \u2265 50) all occurred since 2002 (2002, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2019).Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trends in the number of days with very high or severe Forest Fire Danger Index.</emphasis></p><p>Trends in the number of days in which Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) equals or exceeds (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) 25, linear fit, or (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) 50, linear fit, over the fire years of 1979 to 2018 and averaged over forest ecosystems in Australia (Supplementary Table 1).

Burned area data: NOAA-Landgate (1988\u20132019).</p><p>For the last 32-year period (1988\u20132018, section Trends in burned area), burned area in forest ecosystems increased exponentially with the number of days in which FFDI was equal to or greater than either 25 or 50 (Fig. 6c,d, exponential fit, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> values &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 6 for exponential fits). These trends equate to 21% increase in the burned area for every additional day of FFDI \u2265 25, and about 3 to 5 times increase in the burned area for every additional day of FFDI \u2265 50.</p><p>Using a multivariate regression analysis, we show that FFDI is a strong predictor of burned area for both FFDI \u2265 25 and FFDI \u2265 50, as FFDI alone is able to explain more than two-thirds of the variance in both models (Supplementary Table 3). Including C-Haines and dry lighting into the regression model improves the explained variance only marginally, most likely due to fact that these two variables are highly correlated with FFDI (Supplementary Fig. 7).</p><p>We use the exponential regression of burned area against days of very high FFDI \u2265 25 for the period 1988\u20132018 (Supplementary Table 1, regression no.8) to test whether it could have predicted the record burned area of the exceptional 2019 fire year (June 2019 to July 2020). The regression model predicts a total area burned of 143,151 km2 against the three estimates available (71,772 km2 Agencies-NIAFED, 60,345 km2 AVHRR-Landgate, 54,852 km2 NASA-MODIS) (\u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data). The regression model was not developed as a predictive tool for burned area under future climate conditions, however, it clearly predicted a record megafire year for forests for the 2019 fire year, as occurred. These results suggest the very likely possibility of further increases in burned area in response to the predicted higher FFDI values under future warming scenarios2,6,20,21,54.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire risk factors and fuel load</emphasis></p><p>In addition to weather and climatic conditions, and the availability of ignition sources for a fire to occur, fuel amount, structure, continuity and condition are also key components of fire risk26,29. The availability of fuel plays a key role in determining the intensity (peak energy output) and severity (impacts related to the amount of canopy scorch, canopy loss, tree death, biomass loss) of fires. Understanding the role of fuel loads in fire activity is important as it also provides the knowledge base to reduce fire risk through the management of fuel quantity and distribution in the landscape26,30. Fuel loads are composed of aboveground biomass (particularly leaf biomass) and litter, including coarse woody debris (e.g., dead branches, logs, standing dead trees) and fine litter (eg, leaf, twigs).</p><p>There is no continental forest observatory available that tracks fuel loads which could enable a similar analysis to the one above for climate/weather factors and burned area. However, regression analyses with modelled fuel loads show no statistically significant relationships with burned area (Fig. S7). This result does not rule out the possible role of fuels in influencing burned area, but it is the reason for not including fuels in the multi-variate analysis above.</p><p>Here we analyze two datasets that characterize processes influencing fuel loads and therefore fire risk: (1) changes in the area burned by hazard reduction fires; and (2) the influence of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on biomass production and fuel loads. We hypothesize that changes in trends leading to reduced fuel loads will reduce fire risk and burned area, while the opposite will hold true for changes leading to increased fuel loads.</p><p>First, we address hazard reduction burns, also known as prescribed fires, planned fires or fuel reduction burns, including cultural burns by indigenous people. These fires are deliberately human-lit during the cooler months of the year leading to reduced fuel amounts. They have multiple purposes including the prevention or reduction of damage to human life and infrastructure, biodiversity conservation, reducing future fire intensity and increasing hunting for First Nations communities. We extracted the prescribed burning areas in forest ecosystems over the past 32 years from the State and Territory fire history databases (\u201cMethods\u201d: Burned area data). Prescribed fires burned an average of 3071 \u00b1 732 km2 per year, or about 1% of the current area of forest ecosystems. There is large inter-annual variability due to the year-to-year variability in suitable weather conditions to conduct prescribed burns, but the data show no trends over the past three decades (1988\u20132018) in forest ecosystems (Fig. 7).Fig. 7</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Area of prescribed burning in forest ecosystems.</emphasis></p><p>Data from the States and Territories fire histories for New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory (NSW + ACT, dark blue), Victoria (VIC, red), Queensland (QLD, light blue), South Australia (SA, black), Western Australia (WA, violet) and Tasmania (TAS, green). Queensland data for 2016-2019 is not available.</p><p>Second, we address the influence of climate change and the associated accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the atmosphere on biomass production and fuel loads through changes in temperature, rainfall and the elevated CO2 effect on vegetation growth (i.e., the CO2 fertilization effect)55,56.</p><p>Here we use a highly parameterized and benchmarked biospheric model for Australia (CABLE)57\u201359 for the estimation of fuel types and loads60. CABLE was forced with observed CO2 concentration and climate over the past four decades, but does not include the effects of fire and other disturbances, hence we refer to the simulated rates as the potential rates of fuel production in the absence of fires. The simulation shows a small positive trend of potential aboveground biomass and coarse woody debris (Fig. 8a, b; Supplementary Table 4), but a declining trend of fine litter associated with declining canopy leaf biomass over Australian forests (Fig. 8b). This declining trend could be associated with the reduction in rainfall and soil moisture of the past four decades (Fig. 5e, f). In addition to declining fine litter and its associated fire risk, we find a decrease of rainfall and soil moisture down to 23 cm depth over the past 40 years, as seen in the historical record (Fig. 5e) and simulated by CABLE-BIOS as a proxy for reduced water availability at the forest floor (Fig. 5f) (see \u201cMethods\u201d: Biomass and fuel loads). This suggests a likely increase in dryness of fine litter, which is associated with increases fire risk61. Fine fuels are a key determinant of fire risk and initial spread25, while coarse fuels are more associated with total energy output and overall fire severity26.Fig. 8</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modelled aboveground biomass and litter fractions of forested areas.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Aboveground woody biomass (dark green, with 95% confidence interval) and leaf biomass (light green), and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) litter fractions of forests derived from BIOS-CABLE with varying observed CO2 and climate.

Nominal forest types occurring in savanna, rangeland, and littoral ecosystems are not included: Callitris, Casuarina, Eucalypt Mallee, Mangrove, Melaleuca.</p><p>We isolate the effects of the CO2 fertilization from those of climate change (e.g., changes in temperature, rainfall, wind) on the observed biomass and fuel trends with an additional simulation (\u201cMethods\u201d: Biomass and fuel load). The elevated CO2 effect led to an increase in potential aboveground vegetation (biomass and litter) of 11% during the period 1960\u20132018 but with an overall net increase of only 9.5% due to the offsetting effects of changing climate (Fig. 9).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>We find an annual linear increase in the forest area burned in Australia over the past 32 years, with increases in all seasons and the largest interannual variability during summer. The growth in burned area is exponential for the autumn-winter period, although the largest absolute seasonal contributions to the increase were in spring and summer. These trends show a lengthening of the fire season towards the cooler seasons, where limited fire activity occurred in the early part of the satellite 32-year record. We also find that along the latitudinal temperature gradient South to North, fire activity increased the most at both ends of the gradient, with fires increasingly intruding into fire-sensitive forests: alpine forests in Tasmania in the South and tropical rainforests in Queensland in the North. Both trends, spatial and temporal, provide robust evidence for an increase in fire activity across forest ecosystems in Australia.</p><p>In addition, we find that the frequency of megafire years in forests with more than 10,000 km2 (1 Mha) burned has markedly increased since 2000. Together these trends have led to the rapid decrease in the number of years since the last fire. The mean YSLF values across the last four decades are still within the historical fire regimes reported for the same type of forests9, however, we find a growing trend in the number of pixels in which YSLF is decreasing (Fig. 4). A continuation of that trend, especially in areas with sensitive species, could lead to significant ecological changes. Examples of sensitive ecosystems are the mountain ash (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus regnans</emphasis>) and alpine ash (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eucalyptus delegatensis</emphasis>) forests in Victoria. Both species are obligate seeders that require 20-30 years to reach maturity and begin to establish a seedbank able to recover the forest after fire62\u201364. Some regions in Fig. 4 show mean YSLF of about 20 years or less for the last decade. At this short fire return interval, if fires were to be of high severity leading to tree mortality (which this study has not assessed), both ecosystem-types would be at risk of local collapse.</p><p>We also show an increasing trend in very dangerous fire weather based on the FFDI for near surface conditions and C-Haines for lower to mid-tropospheric vertical atmospheric stability and humidity measures relevant to pyroconvective processes, consistent with previous studies15,40. We find strong correlations between those fire weather indices, long-term changes in climate and dry lightning with increase forest burned area. These multiple and individual correlations establish a robust and multi-evidence link between climate change and increased fire activity over the past three decades. Both increased temperature and shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns have very likely played a dominant role in observed burned area trends.</p><p>Two independent analyses were performed to investigate the possible role of prescribed burning and climate change on fuel loads. We found no changes in the mean annual area of prescribed burning over the past 32 years, although we have no information on how successful those burns were in reducing fuel loads. However, given the lack of trend and the fact that on average, only 1% of forests are subject to fuel reduction burns every year, it is very likely that fuel management had no effect on the observed multi-decadal increasing trend in the burned area of forest fires. We also note that the main objective of fuel management is to reduce fire risk and severity27, which might or might not result in reduced total burned area.</p><p>The evidence for the possible role of CO2 and climate effects on fuel loads is complex, with increased modelled total biomass due to elevated CO2 partially offset by the negative effects of climate change. The actual and future effects as climate and atmospheric CO2 continue to change is uncertain, with the only elevated CO2 experiment on eucalyptus forests in Australia finding no effect of CO2 on biomass production due to nutrient limitation65. We also found a potential decline in fine fuels, but increased dryness as suggested by proxy data, which led to decreased and increased fire risk, respectively.</p><p>Together, these results further underscore the dominant role of changes in fire weather and climate on the observed trends in burned area, and the need to further investigate the role of fuel loads in a changing environment.</p><p>Based on the strong correlations between FFDI and the observed trends of a number of other factors associated with climate change and fire weather, our analyses suggest that the observed trend of increasing burned area and frequency of forest megafires are likely to continue under future projected climate change. Consequently, there are considerable implications for emergency management, health, infrastructure, natural resource management and ecological conservation, noting the severe impacts that the 2019/2020 fire season had on these sectors in Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest extent and types</emphasis></p><p>The forest region in this study is based on the agro-ecological zones of the Biogeographic Regionalization for Australia (IBRA) (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra\">https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra</url>), with the corresponding forest types from the National Forest Inventory66. Forest ecosystems are dominated by open forests of up to 80% canopy cover and 30 metres height and woodland forests up to 50% canopy cover. The forest vegetation classes were developed from ground, aerial and remotely sensed vegetation mapping, the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS), and large field validation programs (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra,66\">https://www.environment.gov.au/land/nrs/science/ibra,66</url>).

ArcGIS majority resampling was used to determine forest/non-forest membership of cells at 0.01\u00b0 resolution (1.1 km \u00d7 1.1 km) for comparison with Landgate NOAA-AVHRR, and at 0.0025\u00b0 (~250 m \u00d7 250 m) for all other analyses. The total area covered by this study is 324,873 km2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burned area data</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A national satellite-based burned area (Landgate NOAA-AVHRR)</emphasis></p><p>We use a database of burned area developed for Australia covering the whole continent for the period 1988 to June 2020. The data product is developed by the Western Australia Land Authority (Landgate) that produces a burned area based on NOAA\u2019s Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1.1 km x 1.1 km and monthly resolution with continental coverage (<url normalizedValue=\"https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au\">https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au</url>). The product has been validated with fire history data from State and Territory government agencies, higher resolution products (eg, MODIS) and field observations67,68 including for forests in southeastern Australia33. It is currently used for web-based fire mapping and applications (<url normalizedValue=\"https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au\">https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au</url>) and greenhouse emissions accounting for the whole of Australia69,70. These data were resampled from the ESRI format shapefiles supplied by Landgate to 0.01o rasters using the GDA94 datum.</p><p>We use July-to-June fire years in all burned area data analyses to include the full Austral spring and summer (September to February) when most forest wildfires occur, including the 2019 fire year.</p><p>The NOAA-Landgate burned area has been shown to have up to 87% omission rate for prescribed burning in southern temperate forests33. Prescribed burning is of low intensity and sub-canopy fires that are largely concealed from satellite detection. For the objectives of our analyses, the spatial and temporal consistency of the NOAA-AVHRR data is the most important feature to reveal changes in long-term trends, and the omission of most prescribed burns is desirable to remove the direct influence of human management. This approach enables assessment of the links between wildfires and fire weather and climate. NOAA-AVHRR burned area is also likely to miss low intensity wildfires. The data do not have attributes on the intensity and severity of the fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">State and territory fire histories data</emphasis></p><p>We collected burned areas from land management and fire suppression agencies from all States and Territories in Australia. Agency data are provided as polygons in vector files derived from a variety of sources. Data include paper records, ground mapping, and aerial photography for the earlier part of the record, and GPS boundary tracing from ground surveys, line scans, aerial photography and, in some cases, satellite mapping for the later part of the record. These are converted to rasters at 0.0025 deg resolution.</p><p>The responsibility for fire mapping, firefighting and management, including prescribed burning, falls within the jurisdictions of States and Territories, which means that there is no nationally-consistent approach, that methodology has changed over time, and there is not a centralized database71. The records discriminate wildfires from prescribed burning, and most agencies began annual fire recordings by the 1930s: New South Wales (1900), Victoria (1900), Western Australia (1922), Queensland (1930), South Australia (1932), Tasmania (1960), with data quality increasing over time (see data sources in Supplementary Table 5). The data have been extensively validated, particularly over the past few decades, and researched (e.g.,2,17,29,61,64). The data do not provide information on the severity of the wildfires or how successful prescribed burns were in reducing fuel loads.</p><p>Data for the 2019 fire year (July 2019 to June 2020) came from the rapid-response National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset (NIAFED) developed collectively by the same State and Territory agencies. The NIAFED v20200622 used a variety of mapping methods (including ground and aerial surveys, and remote sensing) and attribution approaches. The fast nature of the assessment means the dataset lacks national coherency, and tends to be an overestimate due to its precautionary nature.

We chose the MODIS product, and not the NOAA-Landgate burned area, to have two totally independent products (Agency histories and NOAA-Landgate) for long term-trend analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NASA-MODIS burned area</emphasis></p><p>NASA-MODIS burned area data were also used as a third estimate for the 2019 fire year and to fill gaps in recent data for the state of Queensland (see previous section). Its shorter coverage (18 years) makes it less valuable to study trends.</p><p>The NASA-MODIS burned area, at monthly and 500 m resolution, combines MODIS Thermal Anomalies and the Fire product MCD64A1.00672. The data were downloaded for the Australian region in cylindrical equidistant form (0.004167\u00b0 resolution) at <url normalizedValue=\"https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/task/area\">https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/task/area</url>. They were resampled to 0.0025\u00b0 (~250 m) by nearest-neighbour using gdalwarp (GDAL/OGR contributors, 2020), and the burned area for temperate subregions was calculated from the union set of burned cells over the 12-month period in those areas. A small proportion of cells were flagged as burning more than once but were not recounted. The NASA-MODIS data are assumed to be capturing wildfires only and not low intensity prescribed burns.</p><p>The three annual burned area datasets used in this study are compared in Supplementary Fig. 1, and the longer two datasets used for trend analyses are also compared spatially in Supplementary Fig. 8.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Years since the last fire</emphasis></p><p>We construct an annual 250 m gridded database of the number of years since the last wildfire (YSLF) occurrence at the end of the previous calendar year. It is based on the State and Territory fire histories from 1930 to 2019, considering all 0.0025\u00b0 cells that burned at least once during the period and masking all others from the analysis. The fire histories data were completed to June 2020 by using burned cells for complete calendar years from monthly MODIS Burn Date data72 aggregated annually. The number of years since the last fire (YSLF) is selected as the most robust variable to study trends over time because it covers the largest pixel-year population (pixels with at least one wildfire) and gives the current state of wildfire regime based on the last fire. This choice, with the data initialization method below, led to a total area of 155,384 km2 used in the calculations from the total of 324,873 km2 forest area considered in this study. We exclude prescribed burns to focus the analysis on the impacts and trends of changes in environmental conditions on fire activity (i.e., wildfires).</p><p>At 1930, the YSLF is unknown for all candidate cells except those burned during that year, which are set to zero. The rest of the 1930 YSLF grid is initialized with estimates by drawing randomly (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis>) from the geometric inverse distribution scaled by the mean wildfire frequency (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>) (Eq. (1)) calculated from each pixel\u2019s fire history:1</p><p>For subsequent years, the estimated and known YSLF are incremented until historical fire events reset the YSLF to zero years. Therefore, over the entire period of the dataset, the YSLF surfaces go from mostly estimated in 1930 to entirely observed fire occurrence by 2019. This initialization method allows us to use a large population of pixel years with at least one fire since the start of the record in 1930, with observations of both fire occurrence and no-fire occurrence used in the calculations. We only provide the mean YSLF values for the last four decades when estimates have the most observations on fire occurrence and therefore are the most robust.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire weather indices and climate/weather variables</emphasis></p><p>Forest Fire Danger Index. Fire weather data for near-surface conditions are examined here based on the FFDI38, which is similar to a range of other fire weather indices used around the world and based on humidity, wind speed, temperature and rainfall20,73,74. The FFDI data used here are daily grids of 0.05 degrees in both latitude and longitude throughout Australia, available back to 195015. The data are calculated from a gridded analysis of observations throughout Australia including for temperature, rainfall and humidity from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) as well as wind speed from reanalysis data calibrated to the operational fire weather warning forecasts produced operationally by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology15. Rainfall data from AWAP are also presented in this study, as well as temperature data from the ACORN-SAT high-quality dataset for Australia.</p><p>Continuous-Haines Index. Fire weather data for higher levels above the surface are based on the C-Haines index which was adapted for Australian conditions46 based on development of the Haines Index in North America75. The C-Haines index represents vertical atmospheric stability and humidity measures relating to pyroconvective processes, based on two subcomponents: a stability measure based on the temperature difference from 850 to 700 hPa and a humidity measure based on the 850 hPa dew point depression. It is calculated here using the method described in a previous study40 which applied it to ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1979 to 2016, with the data updated for this study from 1979 to the end of 2019 based on ERA5 reanalysis data.</p><p>Dry lightning. A data set containing dry lightning information for Australia was recently developed53 based on a combination of rainfall based on observations and environmental conditions associated with thunderstorms based on reanalysis data. The data are gridded through Australia and available for each day during the time period from 1979 to 2016. The method used for thunderstorm environments is based on previous approaches developed in North America76 and subsequently applied in Australia77, but calibrated specifically for individual locations to reproduce the observed lightning frequency which can vary considerably throughout Australia53.</p><p>Changes in these weather-related variables are presented from the first to the second half of the period used in this study, dependent on data availability for each individual variable. This is from 1980\u20131998 to 2000\u20132019 for temperature, rainfall, FFDI15 C-Haines40 and soil moisture (see Biomass and fuel loads), and from 1980\u20131999 to 2000\u20132016 for dry lightning53.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biomass and fuel loads</emphasis></p><p>We performed continental simulations with the terrestrial biosphere model CABLE-BIOS57,78 at 0.25\u00b0 spatial resolution. The model was forced with Australian Bureau of Meteorology daily gridded rainfall, temperature, solar radiation, and vapour pressure, and near surface wind for the period 1900\u20132018. Except for rainfall, all observed time series started later than 1900. The gaps in the temperature (1900\u20131910), solar radiation (1900-1989), vapour pressure (1900\u20131950) and wind (1900\u20131974) were filled with synthetic daily surfaces generated from 30-year monthly climatologies (29 years for solar radiation) from the nearest period to the missing data. Biomass (including wood and leaf components) and litter stocks (coarse woody debris, fine litter, and very fine litter) (all in kg C m\u22122) were averaged spatially across all grid cells dominated by forest ecosystems and for each year (see \u201cMethods\u201d: Forest extent and types). The aboveground fraction of woody biomass was calculated as a function of total shoot biomass according to58, whereas all litter components were assumed to be 40% aboveground, which is in agreement with data presented in a meta-analysis79. For the analyses, we only use the aboveground fraction of the litter pool. Two different simulations allowed us to attribute the combined and individual contributions from the elevated CO2 effect and changes in climate based on CABLE with TRENDY protocols (S1: CO2 effect only), S2 (CO2 + climate effect): S2-S1 (climate effect only)59. TRENDY (trends in the land carbon cycle) is a model intercomparison of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) with common model experiments and driving datasets. It is used to estimate the global land sink for the Global Carbon Project\u2019s annual update of the global carbon budget59. The protocol is fully described here <url normalizedValue=\"https://sites.exeter.ac.uk/trendy/\">https://sites.exeter.ac.uk/trendy/</url>. CABLE-BIOS also simulated soil moisture to 23 cm in depth. CABLE provides potential biomass and fuel loads based on climate and CO2 and their changes over time, but does not simulate previous fires or other disturbances that also affect fuel loads.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>Vale Vanessa Haverd, a co-author of this paper, colleague and friend, passed away during the time the manuscript was in review.

A botanical sub-project of the University of Bayreuth headed by Dr. Andreas Hemp will be funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) over the next four years to the tune of some Euros 700,000. A total of fifteen universities and research institutes in Germany, Switzerland and Tanzania are involved in the network, coordinated by the Senckenberg Institute in Frankfurt am Main.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Environmental change and ecosystem services</p><p>The project focuses on the question of how nature - in interaction with social and economic conditions - influences the living circumstances of people in the Kilimanjaro region. Crucial factors here are biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides, such as clean drinking water and fertile soils. These are being diminished by climate change and, as a result of population growth, also by intensifying land use.</p><p>\"In the new project, we are seeking to map out, in their overall context, the natural, social, and economic factors that shape the living conditions of the people in the Kilimanjaro region. We hope to describe their interrelations more precisely than in the research to date. For example, we will examine the nutrients in the soil, the diversity of species, and especially those species that have only recently become native to Kilimanjaro as a result of globalization. So-called bioindicators will also play an important role. These are plants and animals that are particularly sensitive to changes in the environment like extended periods of drought, major temperature fluctuations, and pollutants in the air and water. In previous studies, these organisms have already shown evidence of considerable environmental change,\" says Andreas Hemp.</p><p>Research stations on the ground</p><p>The Bayreuth biologist has been researching the flora of Africa's highest mountain together with partners in Germany, Kenya, and Tanzania for more than 30 years. From 2010 to 2019, he headed the \"KiLi\" DFG research group in Africa, which for the first time studied the ecosystems of Kilimanjaro on 65 research plots in locations ranging from the savannah to the summit region.</p><p>As part of the new project, Hemp will also spend several months researching at two scientific stations on the southern slope, together with coordinator Dr. Claudia Hemp of the Senckenberg Institute, who is responsible for African personnel and infrastructure at the research stations. As in previous years, a team of young African researchers is involved in the project.</p><p>The aim: prognoses on living conditions during climate change</p><p>In order to determine recent effects of climate change on the vegetation of Kilimanjaro, previous measurements will be replicated and expanded upon. This includes, for example, the number of species in a given area, the biomass produced annually, the amount of dead wood, and the fog interception. The data thus obtained will be evaluated with regard to interdependence, and extrapolated to the entire mountain. At the same time, Hemp and his team will compare these findings with further statistical surveys. These concern population growth, state control structures, the use of natural resources by the agriculture and forestry sectors, and economic development in the region. This will provide a multifaceted picture of the entire socio-ecological system of Kilimanjaro. \"On this basis, we will be able to estimate reliably how ecosystem services will change over the course of climate and land use change. From this, in turn, it will be possible to derive forecasts telling us what consequences these developments will have for the well-being of people in the medium and long term,\" says Hemp.</p><p>A focus of research: Kilimanjaro National Park</p><p>A particular focus of the research work is Kilimanjaro National Park itself, which covers an area of around 1,700 square kilometres, and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It covers a range of altitude from 1,800 metres above sea level to the 5,895-metre-high peak of Kibo, the main summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.</p><p>As in 2001, the Bayreuth researcher's team intends to fly over the entire area and comprehensively map current forest damage. In addition to illegal activities such as logging, charcoal burning, and forest grazing, they are seeking to identify areas at risk of landslide and forest fire. This will provide invaluable information for the further development of the National Park and its use for tourism, from which other national parks in East Africa also stand to benefit.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7124034 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7124034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600W-29G1-JC11-109H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><timeReceived>9:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In Yunnan province, a severe drought from March to June caused drinking-water shortages for 2 million people and crop failures over at least 13,500 square kilometres of farmland, with a direct economic loss of about 6.6 billion yuan (about US$1 billion). The chances of those extreme levels of hot and dry conditions occurring concurrently are an estimated 43% higher owing to anthropogenic climate change. A forest fire in the region killed 31 firefighters. The conditions favouring such fires have been made around 7 times more likely by climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Canada that year, heavy rainfall led to floods that caused thousands of people to evacuate and about Can$200 million (US$157 million) in insured losses; this event was up to 3 times more likely owing to climate change. That August, Hurricane Dorian dropped half a metre of rain on the Bahamas; climate change increased the chances of such precipitation by 5\u201310%.</p><p>These are just a few of the specific heatwaves, floods and events that my colleagues who work on \u2018climate attribution\u2019 can now show were made more likely by human impact (these and more are showcased this week in a special issue of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</emphasis>; S. C. Herring et al. Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc.102, S1\u2013S112; 2021). Now, these techniques should be applied routinely to help governments, organizations and communities to act on their responsibilities and improve resilience to extreme weather.</p><p>For too long, weather\u2019s randomness has kept events such as these from being blamed squarely on climate change. Reporters in the late 1990s and early 2000s would ask climate scientists about climate change\u2019s role in a weather-related disaster. All we could say was that we\u2019d expect to see more of these events. Now, we can specify increased chances for specific events. This extends to forecasts: we can identify the places that are more likely to see wildfires, mudslides and fish die-offs. Such calculations dent both climate denial and a false sense of security. They take away the argument that \u2018extreme weather happens anyway, so we don\u2019t need to worry about it\u2019. Extreme weather happens \u2014 and these metrics pinpoint what is becoming more likely, by how much and why.</p><p>The randomness of weather is still a challenge, but physics-based calculations of the workings of the global atmosphere can simulate numerous ways in which the weather could have played out, and compare that with versions of how the weather would have looked in the \u2018world that might have been\u2019 without human influence. This lets us estimate how anthropogenic climate change shifted the odds of a drought, heatwave or heavy rain event.</p><p>The most crucial use of this information is to make planning more pragmatic. Putting numbers on the increased likelihood of weather extremes increasingly informs my work on climate-change risk assessments, which in turn helps policymakers and planners to apply these methods to saving lives and livelihoods.</p><p>Knowing how much more likely heavy rains or heatwaves are can help those who manage grids, roads and rivers to prepare for events that are no longer too improbable to worry about. After major flooding in 2007, UK electricity-transmission and electricity-distribution companies implemented flood-protection measures for substations; quantifying how climate change is increasing flood risk helped to convince the industry regulator that the investment was necessary.</p><p>This sort of planning needs to happen as a matter of course. One thing I have found particularly frustrating is that, although houses in my area are now rightly made to be energy-efficient, many are not yet able to cope with hotter weather. (Happily, the UK government launched a consultation related to the topic this month.) Building codes and highway designs are set locally, and are often based on past weather patterns. Drains are built to cope with a certain level of heavy rainfall, say, the highest seen in the past century. Railways and electricity-distribution networks are designed to withstand certain temperatures. For example, in the United Kingdom, a well-maintained railway track should not be vulnerable to buckling below 39\u200a\u00b0C. Poorly maintained tracks buckle at lower temperatures. As yet, the highest UK temperature officially on record is 38.7\u200a\u00b0C on 25 July 2019 in the Cambridge Botanic Garden, but exceeding 35\u200a\u00b0C is now a one-in-5-year event rather than one in 10\u201315 years, and the chances of 40\u200a\u00b0C are no longer negligible.</p><p>Such evidence is also useful for legal proceedings when citizens call corporations or governments to account for their role in climate change, or are on trial for taking the law into their own hands. Although the courts, not climate scientists, make judgements on these matters, the legal process needs to be informed by objective, authoritative scientific evidence; published, peer-reviewed science is crucial. I relied on this to provide an expert-witness statement for the trial of an Extinction Rebellion activist arrested after obstructing the main road on Waterloo Bridge in London. For a case against 33 European countries brought by 6 Portuguese youth applicants, the non-profit science and policy institute Climate Analytics prepared an expert report (see go.nature.com/3qmv) centring on the evidence for climate change\u2019s rising threat to their lives.</p><p>The latest set of extreme-event attribution studies provides yet more evidence, and a reminder that these risks will continue to rise until emissions fall to net zero. We must also learn to adapt, and fast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Climate tipping points \u2014 too risky to bet against</p><p>How scientists can help lawyers on climate action</p><p>Liability for climate change</p><p>The increasing likelihood of temperatures above 30 to 40 \u00b0C in the United Kingdom</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNTURE-d4158602100185x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNTURE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GPW-2JG3-S0DF-Y0R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">486253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nature</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0028-0836,1476-4687</issn><volume>Vol. 589</volume><issueNumber>No. 7843</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January, 2021</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Then all hell broke loose.\u00a0</p><p>In a move surprising to none, criticism from fans came down hard and fast. Most (if not all) of the comments emphasized the irresponsibility of Del Rey's choice of mask during a global pandemic. The nature of the event made the incident more incriminating -- a book signing by nature involves intimate one-on-one social interaction, and multiple photos of Del Rey posing with fans only added fuel to the fire. Swift as a California forest fire, Del Rey's Twitter fans tore her down.\u00a0</p><p>Here, a familiar pattern breaks out: cancel culture. Social media has allowed a system of extremes to develop, an environment where declarations of allegiance are a necessity to claim \"citizenship\" of \"woke culture.\" If you don't love somebody, you have to hate somebody -- the middle ground is no longer acceptable. Judgement calls can be made by anyone, anywhere, anytime. Online platforms act as personal megaphones. Often, the loudest voices are not the most accurate voices. And when it comes time to bring the gavel down and mete out justice, it becomes the shot heard around the world.\u00a0</p><p>Can we still love our icons when they become \"problematic?\" This is often asked in a global culture which is increasingly black-and-white when it comes to identifying what behavior is right and what behavior is wrong. Questions whispered in layered guilt by fans who have found their favorite icons suddenly struck from favor. In a way, online justice feels as fickle and unyielding as that of an emperor or king.</p><p>Now, Del Rey stands before the chopping block, and her legions of fans watch in fear and anticipation to see if her \"head will roll\" next. Does a mesh mask disqualify her from our love? It seems such an insignificant misstep for an idol who the world has cherished for so long. But the pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of people -- a number so large, it seems unfathomable. Mask etiquette has become synonymous with compassion, intelligence and human decency. Del Rey's fashion choice feels like a slap in the face for those who have been intimately hurt by COVID-19 and for those who wear their masks without issue. Celebrity status does not exclude Del Rey from responsibility.\u00a0</p><p>Other whispers online have suggested that Del Rey glamorizes abusive and toxic relationships; some have accused the artist of being a secret \"Trump supporter,\" going so far as to say that Del Rey's American vintage style is indicative of her personal politics (\"Harken, ye old glory days\"). However, all of these accusations and musings on the internet are just that -- whispers. One can't help but wonder if fans and critics alike are simply fishing for some fresh meat to bite. With tensions high and safety protocols demanding frequent isolation, the spotlight turned towards the internet. Everyone loves a good Twitter fight, too.\u00a0</p><p>Should Del Rey be deemed \"problematic\" by the \"high courts\" of the internet? Do we abandon her completely? Do we shun her music and her poetry? Does this become a hard break-up, with deleted phone numbers and zero contact? Or is it a cowardly retreat, where Del Rey is publicly shamed and ostracized in daylight while the world continues to indulge in her music as a guilty pleasure.</p><p>This article poses a lot of questions, I know. Cancel culture paints itself as progressive and self-reflective: On the positive side, society has learned to hold the powerful accountable, to critique the heroes and reflect on how their larger-than-life reputations actively shape reality; on the other hand, cancel culture can be trigger-happy, overeager to place blame while enabling (sometimes anonymous) individuals to boost their own egos by tearing others down. In the spirit of modernity, then, I pose these questions to urge this type of reflection as well.</p><p>So, what's left? A music icon who made a bad decision, a bad tweet. Excitement has soured, but has it gone rotten? Not just yet. It feels too early to call the shots on where Lana Del Rey is heading; popular opinion sways too easily to know with any certainty. By the time this article is published, there might be a new Twitter fight, Reddit post or Instagram reel thrusting Del Rey back into the harsh spotlight of fame.\u00a0</p><p>In one of her first breakout songs from 2013, \"Young and Beautiful,\" Del Rey once asked us in that trademark glamorous lament: \"Will you still love me / When I'm no longer young and beautiful?\" It feels like only months ago, the answer would have been a confident \"Yes.\" Now? It seems fans are not so sure.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Daily Arts Writer Madeleine Virginia Gannon can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mvmg@umich.edu\">mvmg@umich.edu</email>\u00a0</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown challenges at all of us - including The Michigan Daily - but that hasn't stopped our staff.

But the investigation is taking a new turn. CNN has learned two former Trump administration officials testified before a federal grand jury in Washington. Marc Short on the right served as chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, and Greg Jacob was another top aide. Evan Perez explains why their testimony is a big deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: The Justice Department investigation into the efforts to overturn the 2020 election has taken a major step forward with the former Vice President's chief of staff appearing before a federal grand jury in Washington. Marc Short, a close aide to former Vice President Mike Pence, testified Friday for several hours before the federal grand jury that is examining efforts to block certification of Joe Biden's election and instead offer a set of fake electors that could keep former President Donald Trump in office.</p><p>Short and his attorney were seen on Friday leaving the federal courthouse. He is the highest profile witness known to have testify in the criminal investigation and this shows that prosecutors have now reached into the Trump White House as part of their investigation which has expanded beyond the rioters who breeched the Capitol.</p><p>Short was in a meeting on January 4, 2021 at the White House two days before the Capitol attack where Trump and his lawyer John Eastman tried to persuade Pence that he had the power to stop certification of the election results. Pence refused. We know that prosecutors have also been investigating fundraising and organizing for the political rally that served to instigate the riot as well as efforts to subvert the electoral college vote count.</p><p>Evan Perez, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: This is not the first time investigators have heard from Marc Short and Greg Jacob. They spoke previously with the House Select Committee about what they saw before and on January 6. CNN's Ryan Nobles has more from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN NOBLES, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Both Jacobs and Marc Short were really kind of the first big witnesses that the January 6 Select Committee were able to cooperate that were inside that orbit of the White House, the Oval Office, the West Wing and the days leading up to January 6.</p><p>And what their testimony revealed to the committee at that time was the intense pressure campaign that was put on Vice President Mike Pence during that period of time and the steps that Pence stood to resist that. It also really shed a light on things like the fake elector plot that was going on around the country. These were all things that we didn't previously know until the committee was able to really crack the core of Mike Pence and his inner circle. And it shows that they are very much interested in the plot to subvert the will of the American people beyond just the violence that took place here on January 6.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) MACFARLANE: Well, CNN's Ryan Nobles there on Capitol Hill. Now Marc Short spoke to CNN late Monday and shared his thoughts on the people who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC SHORT, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO U.S. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I think that on that day certainly there were probably some people who foolishly got caught up in the events that were happening on the 6th.</p><p>[04:05:02]</p><p>But I think it's unfair to describe the rioters as patriots or merely expressing their First Amendment rights. And I think, you know, as conservatives I think just a couple months before, we were very clearly calling for the prosecution of those in \"Black Lives Matter\" protests who had destroyed businesses and taken lives. And I think that if we're consistent, then I think it applies in both cases and I think that if you heard Vice President Pence's remarks when the Senate reconvened that night, he very clearly called that all involved should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, former President Donald Trump clearly had a different view of those who stormed the Capitol. New video release by a member of the January 6 committee shows the former president was reluctant to strongly condemn the violence. It shows the text of his speech with several lines crossed out including one that said, those who broke the law belong in jail. And another in which Trump was supposed to say the rioters who stormed the Capitol did not represent him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: He's very deliberate, he says what he means to. And taking that out was because he believes that they are very special people. He had said that the day prior. He believes they're his people and he wants them to stay with him. He knew what he was doing by eliminating it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Meanwhile the state of Georgia, a grand jury could hear soon from Republican Congressman Jody Hice. A federal judge has denied his request to avoid a subpoena. The grand jury is investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Their strategy included submitting a slate of fake electors who would back Trump in the electoral college rather than Joe Biden who won in Georgia.</p><p>And the White House continues to downplay fears of a recession in the U.S. as it braces for a highly anticipated report that could show the economy shrinking for a second straight quarter. Here was President Joe Biden on Monday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're not going to be in a recession in my view. The employment rate is still one of the lowest we've had in history. It is in the 3.6 area. We still find ourselves with people investing. My hope is we go from this rapid growth to a steady growth and so we'll see some coming down. But I don't think we're going to -- god willing, I don't think we're going to see a recession.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, we'll be waiting to see how the president reacts to a number of new reports coming this week giving a real glimpse into how well the U.S. is faring. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve will meet to discuss interest rates and on Thursday second quarter GDP numbers will be published. Giving the Biden administration lots of homework.</p><p>Meantime as a sign inflation may begin waning in the U.S., retailer Walmart is set to majorly slash prices in an effort to move large amounts of big ticket inventory. The company is acting to avoid a slump in customer spending expected in the second half of the year.</p><p>Well, inflation fears haven't slowed summer travel, but U.S. storms certainly have. They contributed to the cancellation of more than 3,000 flights on Monday according to the FlightAware website. And the chaos continues, more than 1,800 cancellations have been recorded already today. The airports most affected have been LaGuardia and Newark, in the New York area and Reagan international near Washington DC.</p><p>Well, another day of scorching temperatures is expected across parts of the U.S., including the southern plains and lower Mississippi Valley where it could feel as hot as 115 degrees Fahrenheit. And in the Pacific Northwest, cities are opening cooling centers to help residents stay safe as temperatures climb toward the double digits.</p><p>Extreme heat in Texas likely helped fuel this grass fire outside Dallas on Monday. Officials say at least 26 buildings were damaged and nine are a total loss. A local fire marshal says the fires have all been put out.</p><p>Meanwhile, in California, a wildfire raging near Yosemite National Park has now burned through more than 17,000 acres. Right now, the fast moving Oak Fire is only 16 percent contained. CNN's Adrienne Broaddus has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADRIENNE BROADDUS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And here in Mariposa County, firefighters are attacking the Oak Fire from above using aircrafts like helicopters to dump water. This is a rural area and it's also rugged. Leading to some of the challenges firefighters have experienced. But here's a little more about that challenge strictly dealing with topography. Listen in. KEITH WADE, SACRAMENTO CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT: I come from the flat lands down in the city of Sacramento. And as you are coming up here, you start to see the change in the topography, the rolling hills and then to the mountains and the available fuel load out here, it's trees and light flashy fuels on the forest bed.</p><p>[04:10:02]</p><p>There's so much fuel out here to burn and everything is so dry. California is huge. The footprint out here, the acreage of available fuels to burn when a fire gets going, along with the topography, the canyons, the drainages, the wind that throws flows through these areas can make the fire behavior erratic and it can explode.</p><p>BROADDUS: He also added, they've been able to attack this fire with numerous resources because currently California in his words doesn't have that many big fires. Meanwhile, California is also dealing with a year's long drought on top of the heat which is impacting the current situation.</p><p>Adrienne Broaddus, Mariposa County, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, for more, let's bring in CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. And Pedram we're hearing just there, the acres of wildfires really, you know, no way of containing or controlling them except perhaps if there is some rain. Do we know if there's going to be any relief on the way for California?</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Not in the areas that need it most. You know, there is rain just to the east into Arizona where the monsoonal moisture is in place, Christina. But if you take a look at what's happening across the Western United States, unfortunately, this is the heart of the dry season, the excessive heat certainly not helping out. Temperatures across portions of Washington state into Oregon, Eastern Washington 108 degrees. Work your way toward portions of central and southern Oregon, as hot as 107 degrees.</p><p>And into areas of California, cramming up into the century mark. All of these tying or breaking records. And notice heat indices in spots getting up to 109 here over the next 24 hours. Seattle, Portland, all portions of western Oregon, into areas of northern California, underneath these heat alerts. And this is an impressive multi-day event here for Seattle where temps stay into the 90s, almost 20 degrees, 15 to almost 20 degrees above average for this time of year and finally cooling back down to the 70s where they belong this time next week.</p><p>But again, you've got an immediate fire concern across the region, you've got temperatures as such here that are incredibly hot and in fact just a couple years ago maybe when you cite a four day forecast in Seattle with four consecutive days of 90 degrees, would almost raise an alarm. But it doesn't seem to be the case anymore because so routine here. And you'll notice across California, there is the Oak Fire, 17,000 acres consumed, 16 percent containment. Your question as far as rain across this region, notice portions of California nearly the entirety of the western half of California remains out of the threat here for any monsoonal moisture. Really the bulk of it falls across New Mexico and Arizona, everyone portions of southern Utah where flood alerts are in place here. Very beneficial rainfall has come down. And this has been the case a couple weeks now across this region.</p><p>But with all that said, both the states of New Mexico and Arizona nearly 100 percent in drought even with all the beneficial rainfall coming down and the next couple days additional rainfall forecasts to come down as well. Notice looking forward into the next week or so, still seeing rainfall potential increase there, across areas of the southwest. It does keep most of California especially the areas that need it most out of the zone here.</p><p>But the heat really stays in place over the next several days where we get multiple shots of cooler air for our friends around the northeast. This is an area that we saw plenty of records in recent days and finally seeing Boston cool down from what was 90 yesterday to expect around 82 by this afternoon, New York City also from the upper and mid-80s yesterday down to 81 degrees. So, there is some changes on the horizon that is for the better across a large area of the Northeastern United States.</p><p>But back around parts of the West, that's where the heat is on and again anytime you see a forecast in Portland 10 degrees warmer than Las Vegas and even warmer than Phoenix, you know the heat is very serious across the Northwest, Christina. And that's what we have here the next couple of days.</p><p>MACFARLANE: It's not a pretty picture, is it. Pedram Javaheri there, many thanks for that.</p><p>Well, it's not just the U.S. dealing with extreme weather. In Greece, scorching heat is fueling several wildfires raging across the country. Parts of Spain, Portugal and Italy are also under very extreme danger of fire warnings. A similar scene in the Czech Republic. Dozens of people had to be evacuated as a forest fire ripped through a park near the Czech/German border.</p><p>OK, just ahead, a new hearing in the trial of the American basketball star detained in Russia. We're expecting to hear from Brittney Griner's defense team.</p><p>And Russia slows down its gas deliveries to Europe. We'll have the Kremlin's explanation and reaction from Germany.</p><p>[04:15:00]</p><p>MACFARLANE: Welcome back. The fifth hearing is now under way in the criminal trial of WNBA star Brittney Griner. The two time U.S. Olympic gold medalist has been held in Russia since February on allegations of attempted drug smuggling. The previous hearing ended without a verdict and we're not expecting one today. Let's cross live to our Fred Pleitgen who is tracking the case. And Fred, this is an important week for Griner as we understand she will attempt to plea for leniency. What are we expecting today, however?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, first of all, you're absolutely right, Christina, it is an extremely important week for Brittney Griner where she is going to plea for leniency. And I think that the defense right now, they really have a three pronged approach. First of all, we know that Brittney Griner is already inside the courtroom, the hearing is already under way. Now essentially what she's done, is she's pled guilty. Saying, yes, she made a mistake.</p><p>But what the defense is now doing, is first of all they're calling into question the original toxicology of those cartridges that contained THC oil saying that those measurements might not have been correct. And they also have an expert witness on saying that, look, in other countries of course medical marijuana is used for people who have extreme pain. Brittney Griner has already put forward a note from a doctor saying that this was prescribed for her for medical purposes. So that's the sort of second part of that approach that the defense has.</p><p>And then there's the character approach, what I think is really interesting as well, is that the defense has called witnesses who have simply said Brittney Griner is someone who is not only an important model athlete but also someone who did a lot for basketball in Russia.</p><p>[04:20:03]</p><p>And so therefore is someone who should be viewed favorably.</p><p>So, the trial right now is going on as sort of an expert phase, right now it's the defense that's calling on the witnesses. They asked for the delay in the last hearing and are calling experts again today.</p><p>Tomorrow is also going to be a really important day as well. Where we expect Brittney Griner herself to take the stand and be cross-examined as well. So really important. But you also have very correctly pointed out that no verdict is expected today, probably also no verdict expected tomorrow as the trial obviously is going on for a very long time. That is so important for Brittney Griner as of course she is seeking freedom to then return to the United States -- Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, a big two days ahead. Fred, I know you'll be tracking it for us there. But for now, thanks very much.</p><p>Now to new Russian attacks on key parts of Ukraine. Local leaders say there's been another missile strike on the Odesa region. They say this one hit a civilian area in a coastal village and set off fires. And Ukrainian officials report a major rocket attack on the southern city of Mykolaiv today. They say infrastructure at the port was attacked and air launches, missiles targeted the outskirts of the city.</p><p>Meanwhile the U.N. says the first shipment of the desperately needed Ukrainian grain is expected to set sail this week. The Turkish president who helped broker the Black Sea initiative is urging Russia and Ukraine to act responsibly and stick to the deal. But these Russian strikes on the key port of Odesa and wider region have cast doubts on whether this crucial grain agreement will hold. And the Ukrainian president says his country is ready to start exporting so it can prove to the world Ukraine is not the one blocking the exports. But he warns Turkey and the U.N. must guarantee the security of the shipments.</p><p>Well meanwhile, Russia is planning deeper cuts on a key pipeline to Germany. Nord stream 1 just reopened after being shut down for ten days for maintenance. Now however, Gazprom says its reducing gas flow by half to fix another turbine. The Kremlin insists the cuts has nothing to do with politics but says Europe is only making things worse on itself with sanctions on Moscow.</p><p>Germany is warning that it won't have been able to meet its needs for the winter if deliveries continue at these levels. Well, CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me here in London. And Clare, to gas first, these news of gas cuts from Gazprom, were exactly what the EU was fearing, that Russia is weaponizing gas.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Exactly it. Shocking but not unexpected. Even President Putin warned about this in a speech in a press conference he gave on a visit to Iran. Last week he said that there's another turbine that might need maintenance, where are we going to get a replacement. Clearly this is coming to pass now.</p><p>So, the Nord Stream pipeline is down to 20 percent capacity at this level. Well, I spoke to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie this morning. They say at this level that Europe should be able to refill is gas storage to about 75 percent to 80 percent going into the winter which should mean that they end of the winter with still some in storage, a small amount, except if it's a very cold winter. So, puts them at a bit of a critical position and this is what President Zelenskyy had to say about this last night. He's really sort of piling on the rhetoric about how Russia is weaponizing its energy supplies. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All this is done by Russia deliberately to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an over gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe. This is exactly how it should be perceived and they don't care what will happen to the people, how they will suffer from hunger due to the blocking of ports or from winter, cold, and poverty. Or from occupation. These are just different forms of terror.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: You know, it does raise the odds of a potential recession in Europe if Germany has to move to the next stage of its gas emergency plan that could mean rationing and that does raise the odds in a recession. And the other thing this does, Christina, is it's another test of unity in Europe. The EU energy ministers are meeting today. There's already signs they're going to have to water down the plans to demand cuts that they're bringing in a little bit because some countries are claiming the blanket 15 percent is unfair.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, a real test. Meanwhile we've been talking about grain. The U.N. claiming -- or saying that they still think that this grain will set sail in days regardless of what is occurring. You know, this morning we're seeing more attacks on the Odesa region, Mykolaiv. It doesn't bode well right now, does it?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: It does not. I mean, look, you have to have trust for this agreement to work. The way it works is that Ukraine is expected to de- mine this corridor so the ships can pass through. They have been very reluctant to de-mine any areas around the ports because they're worried that could give Russia sort of an opening to attack, which is of course is what we've seen that they're willing do. And then the ships have to be escorted by Russia and Turkey and another partner out to the Bosporus.</p><p>[04:25:00]</p><p>So, it relies heavily on trust.</p><p>And look, President Zelenskyy, Ukraine is saying that they want to push ahead. He wants to prove to the world that this isn't Ukraine's fault, that they are willing to export their grain. It's just that Russia is blockading it. So, it looks like they're still going to try to push ahead even despite these attacks, but, you know, it's going to be hard.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, that's an understatement.

It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 23.5% from 2020 to 2027. Growing awareness about the ill effects of air pollution, dust, and smoke, and the outbreak of coronavirus are among the primary factors driving the market. According to the American Lung Association, close to 133.9 million people in the U.S. are exposed to unhealthy air conditions every year. </p><p>Face covering masks act as a shield to protect the wearer from the direct impact of harmful particles present in the air. As the air quality continues to deteriorate, the demand for face masks will keep increasing.  The widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe has been driving the demand for reusable face masks.According to the USA Facts report of September 2020, the country reported 6,060,334 known cases and registered deaths amounted to 184,280.  With the restriction on the use of surgical masks, including N95, which are known to offer comparatively higher protection than other types of masks against the virus to healthcare workers, the demand for reusable mask has spurred among the general public. These masks are highly recommended by the government and medical institutes as they reduce the chances of virus spread, which is favoring the market growth.  In terms of material, the cotton segment led the market and accounted for 69.1% share of the global revenue in 2019. According to a 2020 research by Smart Air, an open-source data and content provider on air pollution, among the face masks made to balance protection and breathability, cotton filtered out 84% of large particles and 19% of small. Moreover, recommendation by the organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, to use cotton in cloth face masks bodes well for the future demand for reusable face masks.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase the demand for reusable face masks across the globe.Demand is escalated with the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.  Small and large-cap companies are investing in manufacturing facilities to meet the current demand for face masks amongst the general public, medical workers, and industrialists. Moreover, small and medium-sized market players are expected to show considerable improvements in the foreseeable future.  In terms of application, the personal segment led the market and accounted for 78.3% share of the global revenue in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to rising consumer awareness and maintenance of public protocol of wearing face masks. Moreover, manufacturers and designers have been launching products in bulk for the individual segment. For instance, in August 2020, Burberry launched its first collection of reusable and sustainable face masks made of cotton and antimicrobial technology.  Based on the distribution channel, the offline segment dominated the market and accounted for 62.6% share of the global revenue in 2019. Additionally, with mandatory regulations on wearing face masks in public places, people are experimenting with the latest trends online offered by companies. For instance, e-commerce websites including Etsy and Zazzle witnessed an upsurge in the sales of customized masks, and more than 200 private labels have registered on such websites to increase the sales of face masks.  Asia Pacific held the largest revenue share of more than 33.0% in 2019. The growing demand for washable and reusable masks from densely-populated countries like India and China is expected to serve as a great growth booster for the region.  North America is expected to expand at the fastest CAGR from 2020 to 2027.The rise in the incidences of airborne diseases, pollution levels, forest fire cases, and the outbreak of the coronavirus have been encouraging a sizable number of consumers to opt for personal reusable face masks in the region.  With consumers looking to protect themselves from several virus- and bacteria-related illnesses, such as allergies, lung infections, and coronavirus, prominent manufacturers are focusing on increasing their scale of operations concerning the manufacturing of reusable face masks.

This is why the Government of Canada is investing in clean energy projects across the territories, so that, together, we can work to achieve Canada's commitment to transitioning Indigenous communities away from diesel by 2030 while prioritizing reconciliation, self-determination, and community-led clean energy projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon, on behalf of the Honourable Seamus O'Regan, Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, today announced a $5.4-million investment in five community-led clean energy projects in Yukon. This funding will support communities in their efforts to build a cleaner future and reduce their reliance on diesel fuel for heat and power while creating jobs.</p><p>The investments are:</p><p>- $2.1 million to Carcross/Tagish First Nation to install a biomass district heating system to displace existing electric and fossil fuel heating systems in five community buildings;</p><p>- $1.6 million to the Yukon Conservation Society to evaluate the technical feasibility and customer acceptance of utility-controlled electric thermal storage heaters that can provide reliable electricity capacity;</p><p>- $800,000 to Teslin Tlingit Council to construct a biomass district heating system for eight new duplexes, including 16 housing units, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs for the community;</p><p>- $574,000 to the Government of Yukon to work collaboratively with Yukon First Nations to evaluate and address gaps that delay the deployment of energy projects in communities; and</p><p>- $345,900 to Kluane First Nation to develop a forest resources management plan for the First Nation settlement lands to meet current and future local biomass heating needs.</p><p>Funding for the projects is from the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program. The six-year, $220-million program aims to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in rural and remote communities by deploying and demonstrating renewable energy, encouraging energy efficiency and building local skills and capacity. It is part of the government's Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, a $180-billion investment over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes and Canada's rural and northern communities.</p><p>The government supports innovative energy initiatives that reduce our carbon footprint, create healthier communities and provide opportunities for economic development. This commitment will be more important than ever as we reopen the economy and plan our recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>Quotes:</p><p>\"These communities are fighting climate change by taking control of their energy futures and being leaders in the clean energy economy.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Seamus O'Regan, Canada's Minister of Natural Resources</p><p>\"Clean energy is central to achieve net zero by 2050. Our government continues to work with Indigenous communities to transition away from diesel reliance and to invest in community-driven projects in remote and rural communities.\"</p><p>- Larry Bagnell, Member of Parliament for Yukon</p><p>\"With the Government of Canada's Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities funding, the Government of Yukon has launched a three-year initiative to better support Yukon First Nations with local energy projects. We are excited to be working in partnership with Yukon First Nations as we move toward a low-carbon energy supply that meets our territory's growing demands and facilitates ongoing economic growth and prosperity in Yukon.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Ranj Pillai, Government of Yukon Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources</p><p>\"The Yukon Conservation Society is appreciative of NRCan's support for the Yukon Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) Demonstration Project during such a crucial time in the advancements of green energy projects in Yukon. We would not have had this opportunity to demonstrate the potential for electric thermal storage to assist in Yukon's pursuit of a greener future without this funding. This project represents steps forward toward the renewable-powered, energy-independent Yukon that the Yukon Conservation Society has been working toward for over 50 years.\"</p><p>- Coral Voss, Executive Director, Yukon Conversation Society</p><p>\"Biomass technology presents economic opportunities for the TTC and its citizens while reducing forest fire risks around Teslin and its Traditional Territory. The ultimate goal of the Teslin Community Energy Strategy is to provide the community with the complete means to be energy self-sufficient.\"</p><p>- Chief Richard Sidney, Teslin Tlingit Council</p><p>\"The Kluane First Nation Forest Resources Management Plan project strengthens Kluane First Nation's ability to self-govern in a planned and measured way. This project has strengthened community resilience through the identification of local resources for biomass heating, as well as provided our community with valuable skills in the forestry sector that will see many benefits into the future. Kluane First Nation would like to express appreciation to Natural Resources Canada for its support of this project.\"</p><p>- Chief Bob Dickson, Kluane First Nation</p><p>\"Our environment is key to our way of life, and we are committed to continue finding ways to produce clean energy. This biomass heating system will mark a significant upgrade to our community's infrastructure. Carcross/Tagish First Nation is proud to work with the Government of Canada in our joint pursuit of a sustainable future.\"</p><p>- Chief Lynda Dickson, Carcross/Tagish First Nation</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7242361 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7242361</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X1-FDC1-JC11-149N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Lauren Warner | New York National Guard | May 21, 2020,</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORTLANDT MANOR, N.Y. -- UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crews from the New York and Connecticut Army National Guard spent May 19 honing the skills needed to turn a helicopter into a firefighting machine at the New York National Guard's Camp Smith Training Site.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twelve Soldiers flew three UH-60s to practice scooping up, flying and dumping 2.8 tons of water onto a simulated fire using the Hudson River as both a water source and a target.</p><p>The purpose of water bucket training is to coordinate, train and recertify pilots between New York and Connecticut to assist with fighting wildfires. Helicopter crews that may be needed to fight fires have to train with the buckets each spring.</p><p>\"The most important thing about this mission is building relationships between states and in the future, if we are called upon to work together, we are able to work together seamlessly,\" said Chief Warrant Officer 5 Peter Haack, a New York Army National Guard pilot from Southold.</p><p>The joint exercise was the result of a 2019 Emergency Management Interstate Compact between New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Edward Lamont.</p><p>\"Connecticut is our neighbor to the east, and there are many issues we are dealing with that are enhanced when we work cooperatively,\" Cuomo said.</p><p>The states agreed to conduct an exercise to test their response to a brush fire that crosses state lines.</p><p>The last time New York deployed National Guard helicopters on a firefighting mission was in July 2018. Two New York Army National Guard UH-60 helicopters were called to a forest fire in Flat Rock State Forest in Altona, where the aircrews dropped 126,000 gallons of water on the 526-acre fire over three days.</p><p>To fight fires, helicopters sling the orange collapsible bucket underneath the UH-60.</p><p>The 660-gallon bucket weighs over 250 pounds with no water. It takes at least two people to open the bucket for operational use.</p><p>The bucket is attached to a cargo hook on the aircraft and then an electrical connection is made to operate the bucket. A switch is engaged to open the bladder of the bucket and dispense the water over a designated area.</p><p>For this training exercise, the Black Hawks followed a route over the Hudson River, just below the Bear Mountain Bridge, with the bucket slung below the aircraft. The bucket was lowered into the river, filled up, and the water was dispensed at the target location.</p><p>This equipment is used to put out wildfires and structure fires, and to set up additional water sources, Haack said.</p><p>The training exercise was especially valuable because many of the Connecticut aviators are in the same unit as the New Yorkers, the 3rd Battalion 142nd Aviation, Haack explained.</p><p>The battalion's Charlie Company is part of the Connecticut Army National Guard.</p><p>\"They are our sister company. So, we get to achieve commonality working between the units, face time and partnership between both units,\" Haack said.</p><p>Members of the New York Guard fly together on a regular basis and are aware of their strengths and weaknesses Haack said.</p><p>Now, that they are able to partner with Connecticut, they are able to learn their differences and work toward becoming a more efficient, cohesive unit, he added.</p><p>Connecticut Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan Behuniak, a member of Detachment 2, Company C, 3rd Battalion, 126th Aviation Regiment, was one of the pilots conducting the fire bucket training for the first time.</p><p>Behuniak, a facility instructor pilot based at Bradley International Airport, said that because a full bucket can weigh between 4,000 and 6,000 pounds, the pilot needs a heightened sense of awareness and must coordinate with all members of the crew.</p><p>\"I just want to do the best job that I can. It is a new mission I have never done,\" Behuniak said.</p><p>The goal, Behuniak said, is to be able to respond within four hours to a fire in the northeast.</p><p>\"This enhanced response time and training really helps everyone out. You have qualified crews on both sides of the border,\" Behuniak said.</p><p>\"When it comes to it, we take a really deep self-pride in being able to help everyone out, our neighbors, our friends, our loved ones,\" Behuniak said.</p><p>New York National Guard</p><p>Connecticut National Guard</p><p>fire bucket training</p><p>firefighting</p><p>UH60 Black Hawk</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-DDD521040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOVPUB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYC-JS01-JCCP-01P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247474</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Defense Department Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

This has led to public protests and push-back from the legislative and judicial branches. The latest example is from Wisconsin, where public protests against the stay-at-home orders have recently mounted and where the Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of the legislative branch by striking down a COVID-19 stay-at-home order issued by the executive branch. </p><p>The Supreme Court of Wisconsin struck down a broad COVID-19 stay-at-home order issued by the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health Services (DHS) because the court held the manner in which DHS issued the order did not follow required procedural safeguards and because the order was overreaching. The Wisconsin State Legislature brought this lawsuit as a check on the executive branch's very broadly asserted powers relating to COVID-19.According to the court, \"This case is about the assertion of power by one unelected official, [Acting Secretary of DHS] Andrea Palm, and her order to all people within Wisconsin to remain in their homes, not to travel and to close all businesses that she declares are not 'essential'\" and purporting to establish criminal penalties of up to 30 days in prison for violation of that order. It is important to note that the Wisconsin order is similar to those issued in many other states in that it limited gatherings of 10 or more people, ordered all schools and libraries closed, and ordered all businesses closed unless designated by the executive branch as \"essential.\"DHS argued that its general authorization to limit the spread of communicable disease legitimized its broad-reaching COVID-19 order. The court rejected this argument by noting the order was \"obvious overreach\" and an unauthorized \"vast seizure of power.\" The court explained the DHS Acting Secretary far exceeded her general authority because she did not \"quarantine those infected or suspected to be infected\" but instead quarantined \"[a]ll individuals present within the State of Wisconsin . . . with exceptions she deems appropriate.\" Similarly, DHS's closing of businesses, prohibition of gatherings of people, and prohibition of travel even within Wisconsin \"is not based on persons infected or suspected of being infected,\" but instead applies to all people who enter the State of Wisconsin.The court further explained that the DHS Order was a \"Rule\" issued by a department of the executive branch, and is therefore subject to the same administrative rulemaking procedures and safeguards as any other administrative rule. Because DHS did not follow such rulemaking procedures, \"Emergency Order 28 is unenforceable.\" The court noted that if it accepted DHS's broad interpretation of its power, a single unelected official such as Palm could create law applicable to every person who enters Wisconsin and subject them to imprisonment if they disobeyed her order. The court emphasized that the procedural requirements protecting against such orders exist \"precisely to ensure that kind of controlling, subjective judgment asserted by one unelected official, Palm, is not imposed in Wisconsin.\" In other words, \"Rulemaking provides the ascertainable standards that hinder arbitrary or oppressive conduct by an agency.\"Finally, it should be noted that while this case did not directly rule on separate COVID-19 orders issued by the Governor of Wisconsin, it does send a message that the Governor's powers are also not unlimited:But the Governor's emergency powers are premised on the inability to secure legislative approval given the nature of the emergency. For example, if a forest fire breaks out, there is no time for debate. Action is needed. The Governor could declare an emergency and respond accordingly. But in the case of a pandemic, which lasts month after month, the Governor cannot rely on emergency powers indefinitely.This case may be the clearest yet relating to checks on broad COVID-19 emergency powers claimed by executive branches around the United States over the last three months. This result makes it likely that many more such cases will be filed in the coming months as COVID-19 stay-at-home orders are extended. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411158991035532275776100131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YY0-BRV1-F03R-N1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 19, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU2MUI0N0NCM0RDNDNDM0JBRDFFQzRDRDhGNkQwRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

We will have all the latest on the blistering Heat wave, blanketing much of Europe as well as the United States and part of Asia in just a moment's time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the meantime, a bit of relief of Britain is following the hottest day on record Tuesday. We don't often talk about wildfires in the UK but fire did destroy dozens of homes and buildings around London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the busiest day for the emergency responders there since the Second World War. Wildfires are also scorching the European mainland. We'll have live reports from Europe, the UK, Beijing in just a moment's time.</p><p>A heat wave settling in around New York City to and while it might be a bit of a scorching day outside the New York Stock Exchange, the field I can tell you is a little cooler inside as you can see, and that has nothing to do with the aircon.</p><p>Investors I think taking a breather after what can only be called a fiery day of trading on Tuesday, the NASDAQ rising more than 3 percent with the DOW and the S&amp;P 500 not far behind.</p><p>Europe softer two on the eve of that crucial European Central Bank meeting with a half a point rate hike in play. A bucking a stronger handover to from Asia where the Chinese central bank kept interest rates steady.</p><p>China's premier also ruling out \"excessive stimulus to help boost growth\", Netflix shares a bright spot to set to rally more than 4 percent in trade today after the home of Stranger Things reported another quarter of slowing things, a loss of around 1 million subscribers, forget squid games more like skip games perhaps but much better.</p><p>And this is the key numbers then the 2 million customers lost that were feared. I call that a triumph over extremely lowered expectations. As we discussed on the show yesterday Netflix shares go down more than 65 percent year to date.</p><p>Investors were truly pricing the worst it seems the worst, however, clearly in play in Europe as it battles against the heat wave emergency. And that's where we begin today's show.</p><p>At least 20 European countries are currently under heat warnings. Its fueling wildfires in several nations in southwest France, fires have burned in an area twice the size of Paris.</p><p>The French President is planning to visit the region today. Firefighters are also battling raging wildfires in Italy. Nine cities are under the country's highest heat alert. In Greece houses are engulfed in flames near Athens.</p><p>At least 600 people have been evacuated. Elinda Labropoulou joins us now and Elinda, great to have you on the show. Have the firefighters managed to get those wildfires under some kind of control?</p><p>Oh, I believe we've lost her. OK, we'll continue and we'll see if we can get her back shortly for now. The UK finally cooling down a day after seeing temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius for the first time, the record breaking heat set off red, rare wildfires in London, the London area destroying dozens of homes and buildings.</p><p>Nina dos Santos joins us on this. Nina and London Mayor said it was the worst day for the firefighters in that region since the Second World War incredibly busy for them.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, 2600 calls they had to deal with yesterday is Breton roasted under those record breaking temperatures that just a reminder for our viewers top the mercury at 40.3 degrees Celsius in Fahrenheit that's 104.5 and rising.</p><p>Well, there were blazes that burned right throughout the course of the evening in London around London, particularly around the perimeter from north to West to south and also east where I am here.</p><p>Just a half a mile away from the village of Wennington, which are only few miles outside of the perimeter of London? We saw 90 acres of farmland backyards back 20 buildings being destroyed by fire leaving 90 residents tonight not knowing where they're going to sleep.</p><p>I in fact spoke to one of them who are a grave digger, a second generation winning --. And he and his son first noticed the fires that broke out that caused all this damage in his neighbor's backyard.</p><p>They try desperately to put out the flames with a hose pipe, but very quickly realized that with the winds rising and the earth as dry as it is it was a tinderbox and there was very little that they could do. Here's what Tim Stock had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM STOCK, WENNINGTON, ENGLAND RESIDENT: But once the wind picked up yesterday obviously, obviously the flood the flames are sucking the oxygen. It's gotten out of control, it's so quickly. So - a training so deeply thinking about but laying in I didn't sleep last losing hotel room and thinking I barely could have gone I just thank God that everyone got out alive everywhere --.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>SANTOS: Well two rows of terraced houses were damaged in this place a number of other different semidetached and detached buildings. 12 stables were burnt down as well with horses now having to try and find some shelter for the next few nights.</p><p>And Tom Stock there managed to escape with his wife, members of this family, two dogs in the pet tortoise multi, he said, but across the Capitol, there was other damage by other fires.</p><p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said that 40 buildings in total had been destroyed by these wildfires. The specter of the type of flames that we see burning around this time of year in southern Europe has become a reality even in Northern Europe.</p><p>And we spoke to the leader of the local council just earlier today who said that they become increasingly aware that climate change is a reality for these parts of the United Kingdom.</p><p>In fact, they've actually recently been voted back in and actually nominated a specific representative to deal with climate change in this part of the suburbs of London.</p><p>So this has been a wakeup call, yes, the Mercury has come back down. It's a balmy sort of 27 degrees Celsius at the moment. But there is a reality that fires like this, and potentially other extreme weather events like flooding, are going to become an increased reality, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, that's fascinating, isn't it hiring people to take risk mitigation efforts and to perhaps assess what infrastructure needs to change. But to your exact point in our viewers, and I was going to ask if you hadn't mentioned it, your hair's blowing, I can see a breeze.</p><p>And the sky looks considerably less bright and blue than it has for the last couple of days. As even as we see increasing frequency and ferocity of temperatures in the UK, and in other countries, it is only a few days a year, at least for now.</p><p>And that's the challenge in understanding how to react and how to adapt infrastructure in particular.</p><p>SANTOS: Yes, that's right. And this is true, particularly in big agglomerations, like London, where yes, public transport inside the city continued to work a bit yesterday, but only 50 percent of it was air conditioned, meaning that it wasn't a forgiving environment for the elderly or the young.</p><p>And when it comes to rail services across the United Kingdom, yes, they have somewhat resumed today after a number of services were taken out of action, because the tracks got so hot.</p><p>They started to bend yesterday, Julia, there's big delays for commuters, still lots of cancellations and a big backlog. This is worrying times, of course, for an economy that today published inflation figures that topped 9.4 percent.</p><p>So really, it's another dent to the economy that the government and the people of Britain can scarcely afford these days.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The last thing the country needs Nina dos Santos, thank you for that. China also enduring the effects of extreme weather ranging from floods and landslides to scorching heat wave conditions which are weathering crops and putting lives at risk. Selina Wang reports.</p><p>SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The heat wave continues across China, but rain showers through the south are expected to slightly cool the weather. But only briefly, more than 30 cities have issued an orange alert meaning temperatures are expected to reach 98 degrees Fahrenheit, only one city in Xinjiang issued a red alert meaning temperatures are expected to reach 104 degrees.</p><p>Now compare that to last week when more than 80 cities issued red alerts with some logging temperatures of more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit. But China's Meteorological Administration says this relief will be short lived and they expect the heat to crank up again in southern China tomorrow and then later in the north.</p><p>Now this heat wave has been ferocious. According to state media by mid- July, the heat wave in Gulf to half the country and impacted more than 900 million people, that is more than 60 percent of China's population.</p><p>This is all part of the global trend of more extreme weather driven by climate change. It is not just heat but also flooding in China. Flooding in recent months have displaced more than a million people and destroyed crops in central and southwest China.</p><p>That crop damage threatens to push up inflation. And it is bad news for an economy already battered by the pandemic. The heat wave has also pushed up electricity demand to extreme levels as people turn up the air conditioning.</p><p>For instance, Zhejiang province a major manufacturing powerhouse, urged it 65 million residents and businesses to save power. And all of this is coming as COVID cases are raising in China.</p><p>The snap lock downs and mass testing continues across the country even in the scorching weather. There have also been growing reports of COVID workers collapsing in the heat.</p><p>And residents across the country are still required to wait in long lines for the regular COVID tests, even under the brutal temperatures. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Scorching temperatures sweeping across the globe are proving to be more evidence of the climate crisis more in the United States. More than 100 million Americans are under heat warnings and advisories.</p><p>John Harwood has more on the White House's plans for climate action, John, great to have you with us. We're expecting President Biden to announce some measures. Is he going to announce a climate emergency? And if he does, what does that mean?</p><p>[09:10:00]</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: No, he's not going to announce a climate emergency today, he's going to announce some more limited steps, for example, using federal emergency management money to assist people affected by extreme heat.</p><p>He's going to talk about some regulatory steps to encourage the transition to win to renewable energy, including wind power. He's going to be speaking in Massachusetts, at a defunct coal power plant that is now being used to facilitate wind energy.</p><p>But we have to step back and remember the challenge here. The United States is a closely divided political system controlled by two parties, one of the parties, the Republican Party has no interest in dealing with this issue, doesn't even acknowledge that it's an issue, that puts the entire burden on Democrats.</p><p>The Democrats have a very narrow majority, including a member from a cold state that's very Republican. And that has prevented legislative action. There are some administrative steps that the president can take.</p><p>But the Republican Party, which opposes action, also controls the nation's highest court. So that severely constrains the ability in the current environment for the United States to act.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He's fascinating, and this was a president that came into power saying he wanted to put the planet foil first. And this was one of the key differences, I think, between this administration and the Power Administration.</p><p>I spoke to John Kerry, who is of course, the United States climate envoy, back in May, at Davos, and I talked to him about coming up with some kind of comprehensive climate plan. Just listen to this, John.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY (on camera): Final question, can you promise me a comprehensive climate bill, in this administration, please?</p><p>JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: I wish I had the power to grant that promise. But I have confidence that members of Congress are still fixated on it. They're serious about it. People want to get something can they come together? That's up to them. But I still believe there's a chance of getting some times.</p><p>CHATTERLEY (on camera): Planets before politics, please.</p><p>KERRY: Well said.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Planet before politics, John, but what you're telling me is that whether we're focused on it or not, Congress just won't be able to come together to agree anything comprehensive or concrete on this, despite what was seen.</p><p>HARWOOD: At this moment, they can't, you put it exactly right, Julia, John Kerry has been working on this issue for a very long time in the Senate, in the Obama Administration, and now in the Biden Administration.</p><p>But again, when power is so closely divided, and one party is an obstacle, that means the other party has to be completely united to do anything. And the Democratic Party is overwhelmingly in favor of acting on climate, they've got a substantial agenda, that but for the one vote of a cold state senator, they can't move on right now.</p><p>And that's simply the political reality. It could change. You've got several months to go in this Congress. So either before the election or in a lame duck session, after the election, it's possible that people like Joe Manchin, if inflation, for example, is coming down, might view the equation differently.</p><p>But at this moment, there is not the ability in the United States Congress to act. And Joe Biden can do a few things, but not all that much on his own.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I guess that's politics. But all the while the planet burns and people suffer. But to your point, I guess they are more fixated on inflation and the cost of living crisis. But this has to be an emergency priority, too, John, great to have you with us, thank you, John Harwood there. Straight ahead, on \"First Move\", sowing seeds of recovery how drones fighting global deforestation from wildfires faster than humans ever could.</p><p>And subscribers slide what Netflix needs to show to bring back the darling of Wall Street. Stay with us, that's next.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back and return to our top story. It could be the middle of next week before Europe gets any serious relief from its searing current temperatures.</p><p>Heat records have been shattered across the region and over the past 10 days wildfires have torn through more than 40,000 hectares in France, Spain and Portugal. CNN's Melissa Bell reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A fire rages through a field in Spain as homes burned. In Greater London, a house is swallowed by Wildfire. These are just some of the many sweeping across Europe, where temperatures have soared in a heat emergency that stretches across the globe.</p><p>China's heat wave began last week with 51 cities including Beijing, now under the second highest heat alert level. European cities sweltered under new highs in what is the continents second heat wave of the summer now entering its second week, Ireland seeing its hottest day in a century.</p><p>In the United Kingdom temperatures reached 104 degrees. At first with London's fire brigade declaring a major incident on Tuesday because of a \"huge surge and fires across the Capitol\".</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we just have to adapt. Our homes have to change our way of life has changed really, doesn't it.</p><p>BELL (on camera): Here in France, the temperatures reached 105 degrees difficult enough for Paris, which is not accustomed to such extreme temperatures. But down in the southwest of France, the impact has been far more devastating.</p><p>The French president is do down by those wildfires that have been spreading for several days under pressure from local officials who accused him of not having done enough, soon enough.</p><p>BELL (voice over): Down near Bordeaux, wildfires have continued to spread burning through still more of the parched pine forests that run all the way down to Spain. Already tens of thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes in southern Europe, the extreme heat causing fires in Texas and causing the plains to swelter all the way up to the Dakotas.</p><p>Temperatures are as high as 110, feeling as high as 115. Experts say that climate change can no longer be ignored.</p><p>DAVID WALLACE-WELLS, AUTHOR, \"THE UNINHABITABLE EARTH\": We're talking about weather events that we probably would have expected to see a decade or two down the line. But what's more striking than that, I think is how poorly we're preparing and adapting because we knew these temperatures were coming.</p><p>BELL (voice over): For many people across the northern hemisphere this Tuesday brought those temperatures and those weather events into far sharper focus, Melissa Bell, CNN Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Now as you watch wildfires like this one in France destroy thousands of acres of forest and vegetation. The next question should be how can it be restored as efficiently as possible, especially when traditional methods of receding means time consuming manual labor.</p><p>In Chile, for example, specially trained dogs were used to scatter seeds from bags on their backs. Well, thankfully now, tech is transforming that process. The good news is that drones can be used to reseed burned lands six times faster than a planter carrying a shovel, who can only cover around two acres a day.</p><p>Now firstly, they use to identify optimal receding locations. Then swarms of heavy lift drones follow flight paths to spread seeds in the most efficient way. Seattle based startup DroneSeed offers a one stop shop to replenish land using ceilings they specially produce.</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Grant Canary is Founder and CEO of DroneSeed. And he joins us now. Grant, great to chat, you set up this company because I think you believe that the wildfires that we're seeing are going to become more prevalent and there needs to be a scalable way to reforest. Talk us through how it all works.</p><p>GRANT CANARY, FOUNDER AND CEO, DRONESEED: Yes, so as you mentioned, it's a one stop shop. And so what we've done is taken a five year old tech company, which is DroneSeed, and combine it with Silvaseed, which is a 130 year old seed and seedling powerhouse.</p><p>And so by doing that we're vertically integrated. And that's really important for the size and scale of what we're trying to accomplish. Because with the severity and the size of wildfires that we're seeing, what's occurring is that we are completely overwhelmed on the supply chain side.</p><p>And so by being able to combine all those aspects, we're able to vertically integrate. So start with the land manager, they need seed, they need capital, we're able to walk them through that process when they're affected by fire and supply the seed that's from Silvaseed come out with the drones.</p><p>They're heavy lift drone swarms deploy with the seed vessels you mentioned, and then follow up with seedlings, small baby trees grown in the greenhouses associated were growing millions and pay for it all with carbon offsets.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, so there's a lot in there. So we're going to break it down. I think the first thing for our viewers to understand is that 30 days after the fire stop burning, you can start planting the seeds and seedlings, and that's an incredibly swift turnaround.</p><p>And it helps, as you pointed out that you've got the whole supply chain covered. So you've, you're already establishing that you have the seeds and the seedlings in hand to be able to drop.</p><p>CANARY: That's absolutely correct. And that's really important because what we're seeing with that natural regeneration, the size and disparity, the wildfires, it used to be forest burns, forest regrowth, nine times out of 10 with temperate conifers in the in the U.S. West, that's dropping significantly, because the seed sources in the soil and the tops of trees are being burned up and consumed.</p><p>When we see these high severity fires, which are historically not, been what occurring, coming through due to climate change is. And so there needs to be a bigger solution as a result from humans to be able to step in and get that seed source back on the landscape.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you can cover three quarters of an acre per flight with one of these drones, but actually, it's quite fascinating. So we're now showing images of an area of land.</p><p>And it's your video that's clearly been burned by Wildfire, what kind of soil quality and nutrients are left? I just wonder when you're dropping these seeds and seedlings, how much of these actually, ultimately are able to grow and become trees, because surely they're not all going to survive?</p><p>CANARY: Yes, a lot of you see that big black clouds, that's a lot of the organic topsoil being burned off and consumed in the high severity of the fires. And so what we do is we take the seed that we've acquired from Silvaseed, we've expanded to become the largest private seed bank.</p><p>We manufacture that into a seed vessel, which is kind of about the size of a hockey puck. So it's like a little tiny patch of soil, the seed is in it. And then we drop that seed vessel down into an area that we've really identified in a first pass with Lidar and multispectral imaging, which are just sensors to say, great, where's a seed going to grow well?</p><p>Where's their gravel patch, where's their competitive vegetation or rock faces, want to eliminate those areas, drop the seed vessels in places they will grow. And then we follow up with seedlings.</p><p>So we get the best of both worlds, we'd get the seed, and then we follow up with seedlings, which is the historical method of doing it. And by that we're seeing the highest establishment rates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And because we do have a drone following on this show, so I would never be forgiven. If I didn't ask you about the drones specifically, they carry a 57 pound payload and you operate them in groups of three to five.</p><p>CANARY: That's correct. We were the first and only FAA approved to fly swarms, this two to five aircraft, and to be able to do so beyond visual line of sight and with heavy payloads at 57 pounds.</p><p>So the first step, that survey flight, then the second step, we create the flight paths, we pre-program them, deploying them to areas where the seed vessels will grow well, and then its show time.</p><p>That's when the crew goes out to say, we've got the two to five aircraft flying at a time. And then they land and we swap out the seed vessels and we swap out the batteries like a NASCAR pit crew.</p><p>So that's really how the operations work. Then we follow up with the seed vessels that are the sea seedlings the baby trees grown at Silvaseed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I can see how passionate you are, show time when you get to go out there and try and help restore the London and fix these things. Have more questions, but we have to talk about the money.</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Because one of the ways part of the way that you finance this is that companies can come to you. And I know Shopify already as a client and say hey we want to take part in this because it helps offset their carbon footprint, so in a similar way to going out and planting trees, this works in a very similar way.</p><p>CANARY: Absolutely, we're seeing a number of use cases in which not only is that the right thing to do, but it's a competitive advantage. So for Shopify, what they're doing is they're able to utilize their planet app on their app stores.</p><p>For their merchants, it's difficult to source carbon offsets, understand all the methodologies, et cetera. And so they're able to source for those merchants and then help them offset the shipping. And that's available on their store.</p><p>Others, they're utilizing carbon offsets as a competitive advantage. You see a lot of tech companies, they're competing for internal talent, and they've got a pitch that vision of the future.</p><p>And if that vision is not talking about climate change, it's not a real vision that they're pitching that for internal talent, as well as to their customers. We're seeing the same in real estate, there's better rates available for green interest lend, or green lending with interest.</p><p>And so they've got to be able to first decarbonizes and then second, which means eliminating the sources of emissions to begin with. And then second, translate some of those things as sticky things that are difficult to remove the source of the emissions, transport and other bits.</p><p>And then that's where the offsets come in. And that translates into better interest rates and story for tenants and higher rent rates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, so you are just one company, as brilliant as this is, this needs to be scaled up in a dramatic way. And I like it. When you say to me, look, you've got FAA approval now to swarm fly drones, which is a huge step. But who are you talking to?</p><p>How do we scale this up beyond one company as important as you are? Because this not only is required in the United States, as we've been talking about in the show already, Europe requires it parts of Asia, we need to do this in scale and size, particularly, it's far more efficient than then current methods.</p><p>CANARY: That's really where the tech side comes in. Tech enabled companies are really focused on that scale, and doing so in a very short time period. So we've started out and started off in the Pacific Northwest, expanded California.</p><p>We're adding Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico hit by fires; we're working up in Canada with First Nations, Saito, Dell, and all those communities impacted by fire in a really significant way.</p><p>And we've added New Zealand and Australia. And then we'll be looking to expand elsewhere, as well.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I get your point is about private companies, but what about governments too?</p><p>CANARY: Governments are absolutely part of the solution. And that's, that's, we work with land managers. That includes state and federal agencies affected by fire that need better tools, they need software resources.</p><p>We work with tribal nations; we work with timber companies, nonprofits like the Nature Conservancy and small family forests.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Good, so it is a team effort. That's why I was getting down to because we all have to take part in this and reforesting regenerating our environment. Grant, great to chat to you, thank you.</p><p>CANARY: Grant Canary, Founder and CEO of DroneSeed there. Thank you for your time. OK, up next Stranger Things. Netflix calls the loss of nearly a million subscribers a win as streaming stalls. We'll discuss.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", stock market traders toiling as summer temperatures remain boiling inflation. The market outlook is boiling but for now.</p><p>Investors not truly recoiling take a look at this. U.S. stocks are consolidating a bit after the best day of gains for stocks in almost a month yesterday markets upbeat on second quarter U.S. earnings picture so far but still plenty of investor pessimism out there.</p><p>Bank of America saying fund managers are unloading risky assets as a speed that has not been seen since the global financial crisis. And Sanford C. Bernstein is warning today that the markets still may have not seen full capitulation on reason a quickening pace of central bank rate hikes that will be needed to contain inflation. And on that note, the UK is reporting today that consumer prices have hit a fresh 40 year high of almost nine and a half percent. The Bank of England now considering a half point interest rate rise at its upcoming meeting.</p><p>And in other European headlines we could know tomorrow where the gas is flowing to Europe once again through the Nord Stream pipeline from Russia after \"maintenance work\".</p><p>President Putin is suggesting that Russia will honor its customer commitments even as Europe announces new emergency plans to conserve energy in the face of an uncertain Russian energy supply.</p><p>And in earnings news, let us not beat around the bush Netflix shares are running up that hill after the streaming home of Stranger Things reported a less bad set of subscription losses only and I say only around 1 million customers last.</p><p>I have to say instead of calling Saul, it's time for Netflix to bring up - over at Microsoft and get its cheapest streaming service up and running as soon as possible.</p><p>Joining us now is Tim Nollen, Director and Senior Analyst at Macquarie. Tim, great to have you with us, it's sort of a stranger thing. But there are Stranger Things to be celebrating the what, largest subscriber loss in the company's history, but it could have been worse. And I think that was the message from that the co2 and the investor reaction reflected that.</p><p>TIM NOLLEN, DIRECTOR &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, MEDIA &amp; TECH, MACQUARIE: Yes, I mean, it is still a loss of a million subscribers, and that's the second straight quarter. And I mean less bad than they had guided to. And you know, from the outside, we never have a good way of understanding really what subscriber numbers are going to look like.</p><p>So we have to go by what they say. What they're saying for Q3, though, is lower than Investors had been expecting only about a million subscriber ads in Q3 total. So turning back positive again, but that gets them through the first nine months of the year to flat to zero subscriber ads on that number.</p><p>Typically, Q4 is a better number. And so there's still hope that they will grow this year in terms of subscribers. But they really still are still struggling to add subscribers at a time when competition from a lot of other streaming players has really heated up.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Subscription growth in the United States and Canada. Can we just assume that that's done that market saturated? So when we're talking about trying to find those locations of potential growth, it's got to come from the international arena, Asia Pacific.</p><p>And while there's both opportunity and brand recognition, clearly in that region to your point, competition continues to heat up too. So it's never really going to recapture what they've had over the last five to 10 years.</p><p>NOLLEN: Absolutely. Well, you know, U.S. and Canada, obviously the most mature and the oldest markets for Netflix basically have maxed out. And actually Europe or EMIA region and Latin America have also maxed out those numbers were all negative in Q2.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>NOLLEN: Asia Pacific is the one growth region for Netflix, and that probably will remain the case. The reason though, that Netflix has come out with a new strategy as of last quarter's call, which is to launch an ad supported tier is to try to regain some subscriber growth.</p><p>Now, internationally, you know, that is has been the case for some time that that is where the growth for Netflix will come from. But as you said, there's a lot of competition. I mean, Disney Plus still has a number of markets to enter into Discovery Plus, HBO, Max, Paramount Plus, lots of other U.S. based services, launching an international market, some with very strong brand recognition to begin with.</p><p>So that's an ongoing challenge. But for Netflix, the ad supported tier really is an effort, in my opinion, to reduce the churn to sort of stabilize the losses in the U.S. and Canada, the more mature markets, hopefully add some new subscribers over time, given that a lower price point may be appealing to them.</p><p>But we'll see if they actually can add subscribers in some of these more mature markets.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I guess the hope with this ad supported tier 2 is that you can tackle one of the other big problems they've got, which is password sharing, and obviously they're testing that now in Latin America.</p><p>Look, guys, you no longer get to share a password, but you only have to pay a small fee relative to the broader subscription price. What do you think the likelihood is of being able to convert those sorts of secret password shares into people that are on that lower ad supported tier? What's the conversion rate we're looking at here if we want to try and monetize this better?</p><p>NOLLEN: Yes, it's a difficult question to answer in terms of the numbers. And actually the password sharing, it kind of goes hand in hand with the ad supported tier.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely.</p><p>NOLLEN: If the problem is losing subscribers, or maybe more optimistically, not adding to subscriber growth so much anymore, then the answer is how, you know, how do you fix that?</p><p>One answer, I think is a lower priced ad supported tier. We should probably talk a bit more about what that really means, because we think it could be quite positive for their actual ARPU and revenue growth over time.</p><p>The other is to reduce the password sharing, they have estimated 100 million users are simply sharing passwords, you know, kids on their parents passwords, or parents on their kids passwords and so forth.</p><p>What may happen, I think over time, as Netflix is testing a way to try not to alienate their customers who have been kind of accustomed to doing this for so long. But to just encourage them to pay, you know, one to $3 more per month to be able to share that account.</p><p>It's walking a fine line, because it risks upsetting users who are just accustomed to doing this for so long. And it risks turning them off completely and say, well forget it. I don't need Netflix; I'll watch HBO or something instead.</p><p>So can they encourage customers to actually pay up a little bit more to have other users on the platform? That's a big important question. As you said, they're testing it now in a few smaller countries in Latin America.</p><p>And we'll see how that goes. But I look at this as you know, an element of an effort to really introduce some lower priced plans, along with an ad supported tier that ultimately the hope is to, to increase revenues as well as subscriber numbers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And have 10 seconds. You don't touch this stock. It's not a buy here. Even how beaten up it's been.</p><p>NOLLEN: Right, we are still staying away from Netflix. A little bit of a relief in the stock today on the news, a bit of less bad report. But we think it's--</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But don't get excited.</p><p>NOLLEN: Whether you had.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You got it too, great to chat. Thank you, Tim Nollen, Director and Senior Analyst at Macquarie there, thank you. OK, up next, wildfires raging across Europe. We speak to a French firefighter about the blazes devastating southwest France. That's next.</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back. Europe's record breaking heat wave is bringing with it raging wildfires. Blazes are ravaging swathes of land in Italy, Greece and France, in France is southwest wildfires seared an area twice the size of Paris.</p><p>The French president is expected to survey the devastation later today. Tens of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes over the eight days the fire raged, officials say its spread has now been contained.</p><p>Joining us now is Yael Lecras; he's Vice President of the French National Fire Brigade Union, sir, great to have you with us. Can you explain the current situation? I know the weather has cooled slightly is that helping?</p><p>YAEL LECRAS, VICE PRESIDENT, FRENCH NATIONAL FIRE BRIGADE UNION: Yes, of course this is very good news and that the temperature are going down. What we have to face it's a huge fire. And not only one fire but many fires in the whole country.</p><p>Because there is too big fires in the southwest but we have four so fires everywhere in the north in the south, southwest, southeast. And what we are doing is to stop those fires very quickly at the very beginning to stop them not - coming from the east and people are on duty since a long time since too long time. But we have enough people to fight the blazes. And we have also some help coming from the European mechanism of civil protection which is a good thing and we have two - plain that are coming from Greece to help us to fight these blazes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: (Inaudible)</p><p>LECRAS: (Inaudible). The forest and that is a real problem. That's why the authorities decided to evacuate the people and at this time even if we have the 20,000 hectares burned there is nobody who is hurt seriously.</p><p>No, no people is injured. So it is a success. But it's very difficult to fight a forest fire with all those houses in camping and population inside. That's why we decided to evacuate and it facilitated the operation of course.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yael, have you ever dealt with anything like this before? And the belief is that we're going to see more fires like this. How do we prepare better? What, what do people need to know and to understand?</p><p>LECRAS: This kind of fire is very special. But in the future, I think that it will be more currants - because of the climate change. With so many huge fires, like in your country in America, yes, like in Australia and with bushfires.</p><p>And we have, we will have to face more often this kind of fire. So what the population have to know is that we will always have some small fires, but also huge fire light just like this one.</p><p>And we can have means to fight the fire. But the real solution is in the how to fight the wave of change in the climate change. And this is not a job for the only firemen it is a job for the whole population.</p><p>And what we can do is to preserve what we can to the forest and the economic aspect of the country. But the real key is the climate change.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I think many people would agree with you, sir. Are your firefighters trained for this? These are not normal fires. These are not home fires. These are wildfires.</p><p>And they're called that for a reason. It is more training, more support required for your people to from the government.</p><p>LECRAS: Yes. All firefighters are really trained for this kind of fire. We have a national school for this kind of fire. We have special simulation tools. And we have a real expertise in this kind of fire.</p><p>We train hardly and we have solid experience of this kind of fire. So the people on the ground, people on the air that the firemen are really prepared for this fire. And when we went from some other firemen come to help if they can't fight because they are trained, the forest fire, the wildfires, they go on this wildfires.</p><p>But if they are not trained, they come in the European city to do the currant operation. Because it is one operation every seven seconds in France for the firemen.</p><p>So organization is really to prepare for this kind of fire. What we are not prepared for is the multiple starting of fire in the whole country. One fire, two fires OK, but 2030, it's more difficult for us, of course.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Of course. And we're seeing that all over the world. Sir, thank you for your bravery and I'm actually showing pictures of President Macron meeting some of your firefighting colleagues in the Gironde region.</p><p>I know he'll be thanking them for their bravery and we thank you too. Sir, thank you so much for what you're doing and great to have you on the show today. Yael Lecras, the Vice President of the French National Fire Brigade Union.</p><p>Once again, there the President of France, Emmanuel Macron meeting with firefighters hearing, I'm sure some of the stories of what they've been facing over the past week and a half fighting those wildfires in the Xian region.</p><p>OK, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world. Sri Lanka's parliament has picked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to be the country's next president.</p><p>He will replace the former leader who was ousted after mass protests over his handling of the economy. But the appointment of the premier threatens to anger some protesters who are demanding a full government overhaul.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley joins us now from Colombo with war. Well, you and I were discussing the fact that the former, he's now the president, the former Prime Minister's residence was set fire to in those protests that we saw over the weekend. Congress may be happy other people are going to be happy with this choice.</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, I think it's just - Julia because obviously those who are out protesting are the loudest and the most vocal and we didn't saw that today. I think we have some pictures we can show you of very, very loud and angry protesters chanting pretty strongly worded derogatory statements about the sixth time Prime Minister, acting President and now President Elect Ranil Wickremesinghe.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>RIPLEY: But I'm also talking to people, by the way, their numbers Julia and the dozens at the Secretariat, which is the last government building that they continue to occupy.</p><p>And there's been actually an order to police to clear out that area at some point; we don't know when that's going to happen. There is a small number of people who say they're going to dig in their heels there.</p><p>So we obviously have to watch that situation. But we're not talking about 100,000 plus people or even 10,000, or even 1000. We're talking about dozens of people largely protest organizers that came out expressing their displeasure.</p><p>Talking to regular folks, which is what I you know, I was walking around Colombo, and just kind of randomly - people because sometimes I think that's a great way to get a sense of what people think.</p><p>And I asked this one truck - driver, why aren't people out? Why aren't they protesting? And he said, look, we're tired. The election is over. Let's see what happens.</p><p>And I think that there are others who think that look, yes, he was closely allied with the Rajapaksa dynasty. He's been prime minister six times. So he's worked with obviously lots of different administrations.</p><p>He was the prime minister under the exile, former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa for two months. But he does have a lot of economic --. He is the guy that was called in, in the early 2000s to turn around the economy in Sri Lanka, pull it out of the doldrums.</p><p>And he said to me earlier this week that he could do it again. So maybe people are waiting to see what's going to happen. They are promising Julia, fuel deliveries starting tomorrow, hopefully get those fuel queues down from six to eight days to you know, maybe hours, maybe two days, three days, God that'd be an improvement. Isn't that a scary thought?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. To point they need a government now that can take action and provide fuel and food supplies and try and stabilize the economy in the country and the living standards for people which is the key now, so fingers crossed. Will Ripley in Sri Lanka there, thank you, more on \"First Move\" after this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\". And today's connecting Africa. The International Energy Agency reports that almost half of Africa's population has no access to electricity.</p><p>Madagascar's Axion Group wants to change that by scaling up solar. Eleni Giokos spoke to their CEO.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hassanein, great to meet you, give me a sense of what Axion does.</p><p>HASSANEIN HIRIDJEE, CEO, AXION GROUP: Axion basically is doing infrastructure and services on the African continent where investing and operating on the long run in those fields that is to say energy, telecom and financial services.</p><p>GIOKOS: Why have you picked some of the biggest growth sectors to be plugged into?</p><p>HIRIDJEE: Because it's where you can make fastest disruption. 1.1 billion Africans and today, barely we've got 30 percent that are connected to a grid, which is very low. In my home country, Madagascar, we are talking about 12 to 14 percent, which is very low.</p><p>We're building a small production unit, and we're distributing it straight with decentralized electricity grid to the final customer in small villages. Today we're covering 50 villages in Madagascar, we started 50 villages, we're connecting 10,000 households.</p><p>That is to say 70,000 people are using our electricity grid, which is decentralized, de carbonated and fully, fully digitalized, thereby with the coupon with their mobile money form, and they just plug-in in their prepaid metering.</p><p>GIOKOS: You're establishing Madagascar but you've also got your eyes set on other countries to help for some of the energy needs.</p><p>HIRIDJEE: In Madagascar we've developed the biggest solar farm of Indian Ocean called --. We've developed 40 megawatts of green energy. It was the first solar farm in the country. Now we're developing a new solar farm of 20 megawatts in Senegal on the new port of mineral port of Dhaka.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>HIRIDJEE: We're also working on two projects on the continent, focusing right now in Gabon, the project. And in Mozambique, we're discussing on the project as well.</p><p>GIOKOS: Has your life and world as a business changed since the continental free trade area came into effect?</p><p>HIRIDJEE: Today, we're not seeing immediately the effect of this agreement yet is starting to be implemented. But a basic thing when I want to travel in Africa from point A to point B, I mean, you know, how is it?</p><p>GIOKOS: I know.</p><p>HIRIDJEE: How complicated is it to get a visa here and there.

Helicopter crews that may be needed to fight fires have to train with the buckets each spring.</p><p>\"The most important thing about this mission is building relationships between states and in the future, if we are called upon to work together, we are able to work together seamlessly,\" said Chief Warrant Officer 5 Peter Haack, a New York Army National Guard pilot from Southold.</p><p>The joint exercise was the result of a 2019 Emergency Management Interstate Compact between New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Edward Lamont.</p><p>\"Connecticut is our neighbor to the east, and there are many issues we are dealing with that are enhanced when we work cooperatively,\" Cuomo said.</p><p>The states agreed to conduct an exercise to test their response to a brush fire that crosses state lines.</p><p>The last time New York deployed National Guard helicopters on a firefighting mission was in July 2018. Two New York Army National Guard UH-60 helicopters were called to a forest fire in Flat Rock State Forest in Altona, where the aircrews dropped 126,000 gallons of water on the 526-acre fire over three days.</p><p>To fight fires, helicopters sling the orange collapsible bucket underneath the UH-60.</p><p>The 660-gallon bucket weighs over 250 pounds with no water. It takes at least two people to open the bucket for operational use.</p><p>The bucket is attached to a cargo hook on the aircraft and then an electrical connection is made to operate the bucket. A switch is engaged to open the bladder of the bucket and dispense the water over a designated area.</p><p>For this training exercise, the Black Hawks followed a route over the Hudson River, just below the Bear Mountain Bridge, with the bucket slung below the aircraft. The bucket was lowered into the river, filled up, and the water was dispensed at the target location.</p><p>This equipment is used to put out wildfires and structure fires, and to set up additional water sources, Haack said.</p><p>The training exercise was especially valuable because many of the Connecticut aviators are in the same unit as the New Yorkers, the 3rd Battalion 142nd Aviation, Haack explained.</p><p>The battalion's Charlie Company is part of the Connecticut Army National Guard.</p><p>\"They are our sister company. So, we get to achieve commonality working between the units, face time and partnership between both units,\" Haack said.</p><p>Members of the New York Guard fly together on a regular basis and are aware of their strengths and weaknesses Haack said.</p><p>Now, that they are able to partner with Connecticut, they are able to learn their differences and work toward becoming a more efficient, cohesive unit, he added.</p><p>Connecticut Army National Guard Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan Behuniak, a member of Detachment 2, Company C, 3rd Battalion, 126th Aviation Regiment, was one of the pilots conducting the fire bucket training for the first time.</p><p>Behuniak, a facility instructor pilot based at Bradley International Airport, said that because a full bucket can weigh between 4,000 and 6,000 pounds, the pilot needs a heightened sense of awareness and must coordinate with all members of the crew.</p><p>\"I just want to do the best job that I can. It is a new mission I have never done,\" Behuniak said.</p><p>The goal, Behuniak said, is to be able to respond within four hours to a fire in the northeast.</p><p>\"This enhanced response time and training really helps everyone out. You have qualified crews on both sides of the border,\" Behuniak said.</p><p>\"When it comes to it, we take a really deep self-pride in being able to help everyone out, our neighbors, our friends, our loved ones,\" Behuniak said.

Since that time, similar lawsuits have continued to hit the courts, including one accusing ex-anchor Ed Henry of rape and the network of sex trafficking[1]. That civil case remains pending, but earlier this month, Fox settled[2] claims by ex-Fox Nation host Britt McHenry. She had claimed that her former co-host George Murdoch (also known as the wrestler 'Tyrus') sent her inappropriate text messages, creating a hostile work environment allegedly tolerated by the network. <br/> Filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, Fawcett's complaint accuses Fox of the same old practices of protecting their stars like Napolitano and Larry Kudlow, the latter of whom Fawcett claims to have overheard using 'ethnic slurs' and 'sexually inappropriate comments about women.' <br/>Fox News vigorously denied those allegations in an unsigned statement, which notably said that the network has parted ways with itssenior judicial analyst. <br/> 'Upon first learning of John Fawcett's allegations against Judge Andrew Napolitano, FOX News Media immediately investigated the claims and addressed the matter with both parties,' the statement read. 'The network and Judge Napolitano have since parted ways. We take all allegations of misconduct seriously, are committed to providing a safe, transparent, and collaborative workplace environment for all our employees and took immediate, appropriate action. Furthermore, the additional allegations laid out in this claim are completely baseless and nothing more than a desperate attempt at a payday by trying the case in the court of public opinion as the complaint does not meet the standards of the law. We will defend the matter vigorously in court.' <br/>Fox News Network is the sole defendant in the lawsuit, accused of violating New York City and state human rights law barring gender discrimination. <br/> 'They Look Clean, But They Get Really Dirty' <br/> Two other men previously accused Napolitano of inappropriate sexual behavior before, including a New Jersey waiter who claimed the judge 'forced' him to engage in a 'bizarre sex act[3].' Napolitano's then-attorney Tom Clare[4] depicted that lawsuit as a 'copycat' to allegations filed by Charles Corbishley, who had claimed the judge coerced him into performing oral sex[5] in exchange for a more lenient sentence. Clare called Corbishley a 'career criminal.' <br/> Both of those lawsuits were filed in September 2020, and Napolitano cast them both as smear campaigns. <br/> In his complaint, Fawcett alleges that Napolitano's reputation for sexual harassing young men was well-established by 2019, the year Fawcett says he began working for Fox Business Network. <br/> That autumn, Fawcett claims he encountered Judge Napolitano on an elevator at Fox News headquarters in Manhattan. <br/> 'Even though the two had never met previously, Judge Napolitano stood awkwardly close to the plaintiff, started stroking his arm, and asked who the plaintiff worked for,' the lawsuit states. <br/> After Fawcett replied that he worked for former Fox Business host[6]Lou Dobbs, Judge Napolitano asked whether he was looking for a new job, and conversation turned to Dobbs's horse farm and Napolitano's maple syrup farm, according to the complaint. <br/> 'You see these hands?' Judge Napolitano allegedly told Fawcett suggestively. 'They look clean, but they get really dirty.' <br/> According to the complaint, Napolitano invited Fawcett to his New Jersey farm or Manhattan apartment, and Fawcett 'politely excused himself' after the elevator reached his floor. <br/> 'When the plaintiff reached his office and told his co-workers about the encounter, they immediately started laughing,' the lawsuit states. 'It was common knowledge that Judge Napolitano sexually harassed young men at Fox News, and it had even happened to one of the plaintiff's co-workers. The plaintiff did not initially report the incident to human resources, however, because he did not want to jeopardize his career at Fox, but he did tell Mr. Dobbs.' <br/> Fawcett claims Dobbs reported allegations to Fox's chief human resources officer Kevin Lord, who allegedly responded: 'Well, what are you going to do about it?' <br/> After the previous lawsuits against Napolitano came out, Fox allegedly footed the judge's legal bills, even though neither lawsuit involved the network. <br/> 'As usual, Ms. Scott has been protecting her boys,' the complaint states. <br/> 'Protecting Profits and Preventing Embarrassment' <br/> Fawcett's lawsuit appears to aim far wider than the allegations of 'unwanted gender-based conduct' against him, filled with gossip and news reporting relating to other staffers cited in service of his thesis that Fox has not reformed. <br/> Chief among these apparent digressions are his claims against Wallace, whom the network denied had an affair with a subordinate. <br/> 'FOX conducted a full and independent investigation of the claims against Jay Wallace - he was cleared of any wrongdoing and the allegations are false,' the network said at the time. <br/> Calling the denial 'flagrantly dishonest,' Fawcett claims Wallace's purported mistress was transferred from his office to a journalism role at the network's website, edging out a 'more senior female investigative reporter' for the position. Wallace served as the executive vice president for news and editorial at the time of Fox's investigation, and Fawcett claims that Fox's CEO Scott promoted him to president following that investigation. <br/> 'By covering up for Mr. Wallace and Judge Napolitano, Fox News has shown that its 'zero tolerance policy' is a joke,' the complaint states. 'Even now, Fox News covers up sexual misconduct in the interests of protecting profits and preventing embarrassment.' <br/> Fawcett also claims that Larry Kudlow, whose show he still works for, made 'inappropriate comments about women and minorities during phone conferences with staff.' The complaint quotes Kudlow as musing to staff that he would like to have a 'three-way' with a Fox anchor, while a senior vice president was on the line. <br/> The lawsuit also accuses former Trump economic advisor Kudlow of making bigoted comments about Rep. Maria Eliva Salazar and Rep. Byron Donalds, both Republicans from Florida. Fawcett claims Kudlow responded to a scheduled appearance by Salazar, the daughter of Cuban exiles, by saying: 'Why don't we just let the Mexicans in?' and referred to the African-American Donalds simply as 'the black.' <br/> 'No, no, no, I don't want the black on the show,' Kudlow said on April 29, according to the complaint. <br/> The lawsuit claims that Donalds's appearance was cancelled on that day. <br/> Read the lawsuit below: <br/> Napolitano-Fox complaint (Hosted by DocumentCloud)[7] <br/> (Fox News screengrab) <br/>The post Fox News Producer Calls Network's 'Zero Tolerance Policy'

Spanning statewide, agency employees gathered together through space and time to recognize the past year's agency accomplishments, employee achievements and to set the tone for the coming year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Just like so many other things in 2020 actually just like our agency's entire history our employees are quick to adapt and overcome challenges to continue service to the people and natural resources of Texas,\" said State Forester and Director of Texas AandM Forest Service Tom Boggus. \"That's what we do whether it's a wildfire, flood, hurricane or pandemic.\"</p><p>Since January 1, 2020, Texas AandM Forest has responded to 556 wildfires for 188,150 acres, with 5,368 wildfires reported for 239,180 acres. The agency has sent wildland fire crews out of state to help with wildfire responses in California, Oregon, Colorado, Utah and Nevada. During this record-setting Atlantic Hurricane Season, we've responded to Hurricanes Hanna, Laura, Marco and Beta and sent responders to help Louisiana. We've also mobilized personnel to assist with the Texas Response to COVID-19.</p><p>\"Our work to conserve and protect is notable. Today is about taking a minute to recognize our people for some of the outstanding service they have delivered this year,\" said Boggus.</p><p>During today's meeting, agency leadership recognized 56 employees for five years or more of service, including: John Warner, District Forester, Conroe, for 30 years of service; Courtney Blevins, Staff Forester, Fort Worth, for 35 years of service; Sarah Brooks, Dispatcher, La Grange, for 35 years of service; Daniel Duncum, Staff Forester, Longview, for 40 years of service; and Director Boggus who celebrates 40 years at Texas AandM Forest Service.</p><p>Three national Smokey Bear Awards were presented to Texas AandM Forest Service employees by the USDA Forest Service (USDAFS), the National Association of State Foresters (NASF) and the Advertising Council through the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention (CFFP) Program.</p><p>Jan Davis, Deputy Regional Forester for USDA Forest Service, presented the Bronze Smokey Bear Award to a group of employees comprising the Texas AandM Forest Service Smokey Bear 75th Wildfire Prevention Team. She presented a Bronze Smokey Bear Award to Director Tom Boggus for his leadership of the CFFP and for his advocacy nationwide for wildfire prevention. Davis also presented the coveted Gold Smokey Bear Award to Karen Stafford for her contributions to the National Smokey Bear 75th Planning Team.</p><p>\"It is an honor to present these awards to such a hardworking, creative and deserving group of professionals,\" Davis said. \"These days when people think about forestry and the Forest Service, they may think about wildfires; but when you say Smokey Bear, people immediately think about wildfire prevention. The recipients of these awards have demonstrated their commitment to preventing wildfire through education throughout Texas and across the country. And we simply cannot thank you enough.\"</p><p>Employees who consistently deliver excellent service above-and-beyond regular job duties were presented with Director's Awards.</p><p>Director's Award for Support Staff Field: Arthur Nichols, Farm Foremen, Kirbyville</p><p>Nichols is recognized for his leadership in the Western Gulf Forest Tree Improvement Program and for work through a Texas Christmas Tree Growers Association grant.</p><p>Director's Award for Support Staff Professional: Fernando Vara, Geospatial Developer, College Station</p><p>Vara is recognized for his impact on Texas AandM Forest Service and the citizens of Texas with his many contributions in web application development and maintenance.</p><p>Director's Award for Support Staff Office: Amy Burnett, Business Associate, New Boston</p><p>Burnett is recognized for her support, organizational skills and service to the State of Texas and the New Boston District.</p><p>D.A. \"Andy\" Anderson Information and Education Award: Eric Taylor, Silviculturist, Overton</p><p>Taylor is recognized for his knowledge base, ability to convey complex concepts and the ability to write and develop high quality deliverables, many often at the forefront of emerging issues and opportunities for the forest sector.</p><p>Director's Award for Technical Forestry: John Hawkins, District Forester, New Boston</p><p>Hawkins is recognized for his leadership in forest and fire management and his leadership example to fellow employees.</p><p>Charles Krenek Award for Resource Specialist: Joshua \"Blu\" Bluford, Resource Specialist, Houston</p><p>The Texas AandM Forest Service Resource Specialist supports the delivery of all agency programs. This could include working with landowners and fire departments, wildland firefighting and disaster response. Bluford is recognized for his professionalism and hard work ethic, and is known as the type of a person who goes out of his way to help others with whatever they need.</p><p>Director's Award for Team Effort: Operation Ponderosa</p><p>Operation Ponderosa aims to restore ponderosa pine to the Davis Mountains of West Texas after decades of decline due to drought, insects, wildfire and fire suppression. This program has involved the identification, mapping and inventory of surviving stands, protecting existing stands and large trees and regeneration at The Nature Conservancy's Davis Mountains Preserve.</p><p>Operation Ponderosa is an interdivisional collaboration helping to ensure the continued viability of this unique ecosystem.</p><p>Operation Ponderosa consists of: Jason Calvet, Task Force Coordinator, Robert Edmonson, Biologist, Erin Davis, Staff Forester, Karl Flocke, Woodland Ecologist, Brad Barber, Geospatial Systems Coordinator, Joe Mike Pasqua, Fire Coordinator, Rich Gray, Chief Regional Fire Coordinator, Aaron Stottlemyer, Forest Resource Analyst II, Mary Leathers, Capacity Building Specialist, Dustin Morris, Task Force Coordinator, Cameron Dudley, Forestry Nursery Operations Coordinator, and Fred Raley, Tree Improvement Coordinator.</p><p>In an unpredictable year, Texas AandM Forest Service is proud to recognize agency accomplishments and employee achievements while looking forward to the future and the coming year of service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124072687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:618D-JKH1-JCBF-S1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Through the oval porthole, in place of the usual crisp yellow sunshine, I saw a thick orange haze.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's been a mistake, I told myself. I was supposed to land at noon, but maybe it's evening. Maybe it's just sunset in fog. But no. Forest fire smoke had blotted out the sun. I figured it would clear up when I got to campus, or maybe the next day, but it didn't. Morning came in a sulfur-cloud haze, as did noon and evening, all the way until night. Two mornings later, looking out my window, I found myself wondering if the sky really used to be blue, or if I'd just imagined it.</p><p>Then I got another one of those emails: \"It goes without saying at this point,\" they said, \"But this is not the way any of us had hoped to begin [the quarter].\"</p><p>And I wondered: why are we still saying it if it goes without saying? How many more times do we need to hear words like trying, tumultuous or challenging as adjectives to times before we accept that these are simply the times we live in? How often do we need to be reminded that our hopes are unfulfilled and will remain as such for the foreseeable future?</p><p>When I signed Stanford's Campus Compact, I was like, shit, this is strict; if only we could go back to last spring quarter's rules. But during spring quarter, I remember wishing things could be like the year before, and the year before I was wishing I could fast-forward time to be recovered from surgery, and on and on until I'm never really living, just postponing it until some goal is fulfilled, after which, I promise myself, I'll be free to soak it all in and start enjoying it.</p><p>\"Hope,\" writes Emily Dickinson, \"Is the thing with feathers/ that perches in the soul/ and sings the tune without the words/ and never stops at all.\" Sure. It's also the thing with talons and a vulture-beak that doesn't give a shit whether you're living, appreciating, soaking in or whatever similar verb lets you cherish your being. Instead, it forces you to fixate on a romanticized past or unrealistic future at the cost of your now.</p><p>If you'd known that the last time you saw a clear sky would be the last time you saw a clear sky, would you not have looked up at it, stared until your neck cramped, until your eyes watered and the sapphire crispness was seared into your mind like a loved one's last words?</p><p>If you'd known there would come a time when you couldn't even shake hands without a fine, would you not have run through the Quad or your local mall, hugged every person who would let you, held them close and breathed in their perfume, pomade or herbal shampoo and squeezed until they pushed you away with perplexed looks?</p><p>What is it we should savor now? Should I run my fingers through every bush, wave to every masked passerby and lay down on every slab of cold, smooth marble?

A conversation that needs to be had more and more, one that needs to be destigmatized. The cat is out of the bag, and it has been for quite some time. Anyone who does not believe the disease of addiction can affect their life, whether directly or indirectly, is simply turning a blind eye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drug addiction can affect anyone from any socioeconomic background, any sex, any race; the fact is that addiction does not discriminate. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2019 alone, among people aged 12 or older, 57.2 million people used illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs. 9.7 million of those misused prescription painkillers, 5.9 million misused prescription tranquilizers or sedatives, 5.5 million used cocaine, 5.5 million misused prescription stimulants, and 2 million used methamphetamines. According to the CDC, over 70,000 people died from overdose, 50,000 of those involving opioids.</p><p>As an individual or family member whose loved one is caught in the thick of the desperate trap that is addiction, finding the right help seemingly only adds more confusion and more difficulty in the battle of overcoming addiction.</p><p>Individuals seeking help for substance addiction can find assistance with United Recovery Project, a unique and intensive program designed for those struggling with substance abuse. United Recovery Project offers a comprehensive and holistic approach to addiction treatment. Treatment typically begins withdetoxificationor \"detox\" for short. Detox is the first step in the journey towards recovery, and is very important to safely rid your body of the toxins associated with drugs and alcohol in amedically supervised environment. While there are many different types oftreatment optionsoffered, individuals have the option to reside in one of the manyluxurious facilitiesoffered by United Recovery Project during the course of their treatment.</p><p>Bryan Alzate serves as the Chief Executive Officer of United Recovery Project, and he has a vested passion as an active member of the recovery community with over 10 years substance abuse free.</p><p>Before co-founding the United Recovery Project, Bryan attended Florida Atlantic University and today brings 9 years of substance abuse treatment experience to United Recovery Project. It is more than a goal; it is his life's mission to provide a safe, healing environment where clients are given the tools needed to achieve total health and wellness.</p><p>His newly released Podcast Hell Has an Exit features people from all different walks of life who have found their way out of Hell against all odds. The podcast is intended to further the message that \"We Do Recover\". The episodes focus primarily on addiction with episodes ranging all the way from stories of the son of a Colombian cartel boss doing cocaine at 12, to a drug addicted gangbanger selling kilos of cocaine who now has 9 years clean and multiple college degrees, to a cheerleader addicted to heroin obtaining her Master's degree and becoming a present and loving mother. And while the podcast's main focus is addiction, some episodes feature people exiting different kinds of \"Hell\". In one episode, Bryan sits down with Anita Karl, as she tells her story of being one of the youngest survivors of the Holocaust. Hell Has an Exit is a way for those who have been affected by addiction to access the minds and thoughts of others who may have found themselves in similar situations. As human beings, relating to others and discovering that we are not alone in our battles is one very important part of the healing process. Learning to accept the help of others while also learning to trust that we do deserve better despite what our subconscious tells us, is part of the message that Bryan wants to spread.</p><p>In an interview with Bryan, we ask him a series of questions to help us understand where he stands on some touchy subject surrounding Big Pharma &amp; the reputation of rehabs.</p><p>When we asked Bryan what his stance is on the damage caused by Big Pharma (Purdue) his response was:</p><p>\"Sure I can place blame on Big Pharma for the opioid epidemic we're living in today, but at the end of the day there are people whose jobs it is to fight the big corruption. Placing blame is the easy way out, there's no action in placing blame for someone like me.</p><p>My job is to spark the flame in the addict who doesn't think he can. That's what I focus on. Little sparks all over the world. Not trying to put out a forest fire. I'm focused on starting my own fire.</p><p>I want people talking about how cool recovery is. How fun rehab was. How successful addicts are, how smart addicts are and how diverse they are.</p><p>It's easy to be angry and to get caught up in the news. Does the news about the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma do anything for me? Maybe. Maybe it's good to know justice is being served. But what about Kratom, what about fentanyl? What about the scam rehabs that pay addicts to go there; that house them like slaves and bill their insurance? Sure, it felt good when Safe Haven, the worst rehab in Florida, got shut down and they went to prison. But guess what, the next day there were 3 more. So again, what good does it do for me to focus on all the scams? I want to talk about the good places and focus on the fact that there are good places. I want addicts that need help to be able to trust that there is good help out there.\"</p><p>With the Hell Has an Exit podcast and United Recovery Project, Bryan's mission is to help addicts trust that there is good help out there and that they can start their road to recovery too.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">___</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tweet falsely attributed to Virginia Tech swimmer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CLAIM: Reka Gyorgy, a Virginia Tech swimmer, posted from her personal Twitter account a statement saying her finals spot was \u201cstolen\u201d by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, and she encouraged other swimmers to refuse to compete.</p><p>THE FACTS: The tweet did not come from Gyorgy\u2019s account. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press that the user responsible for the tweet was suspended for violating the platform\u2019s policy on the \u201ccreation of fake accounts,\" and multiple representatives from Virginia Tech\u2019s athletics department also said the account was not authentic. The tweet gained more than 28,000 retweets and 101,000 likes before the account was suspended Monday, about a day after the post was made. The critical message came after Thomas, a University of Pennsylvania senior, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-swimming-erica-sullivan-2423ade67c279e9a7ac85a1733d17de4\">made history</url> on March 17 as the first transgender woman to win an NCAA swimming championship. Gyorgy had criticized the NCAA rules that allowed Thomas to compete in the women\u2019s division on other platforms, and called for them to be changed in a letter posted publicly to her Facebook account on Sunday afternoon. But the tweet posted hours later under a profile using Gyorgy\u2019s name and photo did not come from an account belonging to her, according to Twitter. \u201cThe account referenced has been permanently suspended for violating our platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts,\u201d Twitter wrote in a statement to the AP. Pete Moris, Virginia Tech\u2019s associate athletics director for strategic communications, and Sergio Lopez Miro, women\u2019s swimming and diving head coach, also confirmed that the tweet did not come from Gyorgy. \u201cThe account was fake,\u201d Lopez Miro wrote in an email to the AP. The earliest available record of the now-suspended page was captured on March 20 by the internet archive the WayBack Machine. At that time, the account had posted several retweets supporting Republican politicians dating back to December 2021. The account had not posted any content about swimming or Gyorgy until March 17, when the NCAA women\u2019s swimming championships were underway. Additionally, the same account previously used the handle \u201c@Amanda191923\u201d before changing it to \u201cRekaGyorgy_.\u201d Searches on Twitter for the Amanda username reveal older tweets now linked to the fake Gyorgy account. Before it was deleted, several conservative news outlets and social media users with large followings had retweeted or shared screenshots of the tweet about Thomas, representing it as a genuine post from Gyorgy. Thomas has followed NCAA and Ivy League rules since she began her transition in 2019 by starting hormone replacement therapy, the AP has <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/sports-swimming-erica-sullivan-2423ade67c279e9a7ac85a1733d17de4\">reported</url>.

Nongovernmental organizations have also said that far fewer civilians were killed by the NATO airstrikes, with estimates ranging from 72 to 403. After former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi\u2019s regime violently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-libya-united-nations-tripoli-75feca9c40d04f94abc7d79d7e934f39\">cracked down</url> on anti-government protesters, NATO, with U.N.-backing, conducted a campaign of airstrikes against the regime between March and October of 2011, the AP<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-libya-nato-c618bfb9e7124f59b1ad56e63546f99a\">reported</url>. NATO warplanes conducted more than 9,600 <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-africa-middle-east-united-nations-tripoli-45db1903cbea45aaaf46ecd648c743f6\">strike missions,</url> and the campaign ended after Gadhafi was ousted and killed. In recent days, widely-circulating social media posts have claimed that NATO forces killed tens of thousands of civilians during the 2011 military intervention. \u201cThe most air strikes ever launched in Africa by NATO was more than 10,000 on Libya in 2011 with over 500,000 Civilian Casualities,\u201d said one tweet. Another Twitter user claimed that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by NATO forces in Libya while comparing the allegation to Russia\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-98f7149c96a25d82e00682202f1d0484\">invasion of Ukraine</url>. \u201cNATO+USA+France killed 55k+ civilians in Libya because they wouldn\u2019t accept the jihadist rule that NATO+Obama admin eventually bombed into power there,\u201d the user wrote on Sunday. \u201cThe Russian people are correct to be terrified of NATO.\u201d No credible estimates support the assertions that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by the 2011 NATO airstrikes in Libya. \u201cThose numbers strike me as wildly off. Wildly exaggerated,\u201d said Daniel Serwer, a professor and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Alan Kuperman, a University of Texas professor whose research focuses include ethnic conflict and military intervention, also told the AP that the claims are \u201cexaggerated by a factor of 100 times or more.\u201d The U.N.-appointed Commission of Inquiry on Libya investigated some of the airstrikes and found that while NATO did not intentionally target civilians, 60 civilians were killed and 55 were wounded, the AP<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-libya-anders-fogh-rasmussen-nato-ddba3b1380a74df0bc543bbc3dcfb061\">reported</url> in March 2012. Separately, Human Rights Watch concluded in a May 2012 <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-libya-civil-wars-tripoli-60776811c4834d1d9e9d6f5da092bbf1\">report</url> that at least 72 civilians were killed by NATO airstrikes. In March 2021, Airwars, a group that tracks civilian harm in conflict <url normalizedValue=\"https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/ten-years-after-libyan-revolution-victims-wait-for-justice/\">zones</url>, estimated that NATO strikes caused 223 to 403 likely civilian deaths. Chris Woods, director of Airwars, wrote in an email to the AP that the claims that tens of thousands of civilians were killed by NATO airstrikes is \u201cnot supported by any public claim we are aware of,\" adding that: \u201cThe great majority of civilians killed in Libya in 2011 also died as a result of Gaddafi forces actions.\" In an emailed statement to the AP, NATO Deputy Spokesperson Piers Cazalet declined to confirm the number of Libyan civilians killed by NATO actions in 2011. \u201cEverything possible was done to minimise the risk to civilians, but in a complex military campaign, that risk cannot be reduced to zero,\u201d Cazalet said, adding: \u201cIt is likely some have been affected in the seven months-long campaign. We deeply regret any instance of civilian casualties.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Associated Press writer Josh Kelety in Phoenix contributed this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Space Foundation did not strip Russian cosmonaut of honors</p><p>CLAIM: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/yuri-gagarin-soviet-spaceflight-60th-anniversary-bbb2cf68c5eb9a724df52c3b13bd0d4f\">Yuri Gagarin</url>, the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first person to go to space 61 years ago, has been stripped of his honors by the Space Foundation because he is Russian.</p><p>THE FACTS: The Space Foundation changed the name of an annual fundraiser that was previously known as \u201cYuri\u2019s Night,\u201d but it didn\u2019t strip Gagarin of any honors. The nonprofit, which advocates for the global space industry, continues to celebrate Gagarin\u2019s accomplishments at events and with a display at its Discovery Center, a spokesman told The Associated Press. The Space Foundation\u2019s decision to rename an annual fundraiser amid Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was distorted by social media users who falsely claimed the organization stripped Gagarian of official honors. \u201cRussian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, has been stripped of his honours by the Space Foundation \u2018in light of current events,\u2019\u201d read a tweet, which was shared across platforms in a screenshot. \u201cImagine pretending Neil Armstrong never walked on the moon because the US invaded Iraq decades later,\u201d another post commented. But the Space Foundation isn\u2019t pretending Gagarin wasn\u2019t the first man in space. Instead, it changed the name of an annual fundraiser from \u201cYuri\u2019s Night\u201d to \u201cA Celebration of Space: Discover What\u2019s Next\u201d after its initial social media posts about the April 3 fundraiser elicited negative responses about Russia on social media. \u201cAlmost four weeks ago, we posted about Yuri\u2019s Night and our social media feeds started to feed into a lot of anti-Russian anger,\u201d Rich Cooper, vice president of strategic communications and outreach at the Space Foundation, said in a phone interview with the AP. \u201cWe wanted to not have our social media platforms become any type of venue for hate or animosity against anyone. We changed the name out of respect for that situation.\u201d Cooper said the narrative that the Space Foundation was stripping Gagarin of any honors is \u201ctotally false\u201d and added that \u201cno one can strip away\u201d the honor of being the first person to go to space. The Space Foundation has not conferred specific honors to Gagarian but it has a display for the cosmonaut at its Discovery Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The nonprofit has no plans to stop celebrating Gagarin\u2019s accomplishments in any capacity, Cooper said.

Following the crash, Twitter users began sharing a video game clip of a plane plummeting from the sky, falsely claiming it showed the China Eastern crash. The footage takes the point of view from a window seat, from which a red, yellow and green Ethiopian Airlines logo can be seen on the plane\u2019s wing. Screams can be heard in the background. \u201cA Boeing 737 just crashed in southern China. This was one of the last moment recorded on the plane. maybe the only moment.

The video circulating on social media is identical to a portion of a longer clip <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5QnJ9OHkBI\">posted</url> to YouTube on March 10, 2019. That post states that the footage was made from the flight simulator game X-Plane 11, as an attempt to recreate how an Ethiopian Airlines jet <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ethiopia-accidents-ap-top-news-international-news-asia-81bd51c541324176b571ac2787a13e05\">crashed after takeoff</url> in March 2019. \u201cThis is only a simulated flight crash for Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302,\u201d the video\u2019s caption states.

The 10-minute clip on YouTube shows the aircraft taking off and ends with the plane falling from the sky. The video notes that the screams were edited into the flight simulator footage: \u201cThis sound is added while editing, so this is not implemented from the simulator,\u201d an on-screen caption states.

The false claim that the site had implemented a feature warning users when they visit an account created by a registered sex offender spread after a Twitter user created a hoax warning on their profile page to make it seem like Twitter was notifying people about a sex offender on the platform. On Tuesday, a Twitter user posted a screenshot of a different user\u2019s profile page with the caption: \u201cWhen did Twitter start showing that you\u2019re a sex offender ??\u201d A notice on that user\u2019s page featured a man\u2019s photo next to a warning symbol and the text \u201cThis user is a registered sex offender, to learn more visit twitter\u2019s safety policy.\" The tweet suggesting this was an authentic notice received more than 20,000 retweets and 101,000 likes. While some people pointed out that the feature was not legitimate, many others shared the tweet as if the warning was real. But the banner did not show an official notice. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed in a phone call to The Associated Press that the platform has no such feature. The person who posted the false notice used Twitter\u2019s newsletter feature to make a fake warning label. Twitter allows users to create newsletters through its tool Revue, and pin them prominently to their profiles to get people to subscribe. Since a person can type anything to create such a newsletter, this person wrote \u201cthis user is a registered sex offender\u201d and pinned it to their profile. Twitter\u2019s help center <url normalizedValue=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/newsletter-subscribe\">states</url> that: \u201ccreators can control the display of the newsletter feature on their Twitter profiles,\u201d but warns, \u201cWe do not permit this feature to be used as \u2018clickbait\u2019 or for promoting external products or services, distributing offers or promotions, or similar activity.\u201d The hoax banner has since been removed from the user\u2019s profile, and the link to Revue now directs to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.getrevue.co/profile/gmtoshit/issues/weekly-newsletter-of-honest-kankan-fan-issue-1-1059172?via=twitter-profile&amp;client=DesktopWeb&amp;element=read-sample-issue\">message</url> saying the newsletter has been suspended. A Twitter spokesperson told the AP on Wednesday that the account that posted the hoax notice was also later permanently suspended for violating a spam policy. The photo of the man that was used has appeared online dozens of times over the years, usually as a meme.</p><p>\u2014 Sophia Tulp</p><p>___</p><p>All states can fly their flags as high as Old Glory, not just Texas</p><p>CLAIM: Texas is the only state whose flag can fly at the same height as the U.S. flag.</p><p>THE FACTS: All state flags can be flown at the same height as the U.S. flag, contrary to a long-running myth that some social media users are sharing. \u201cTexas is the only state whose flag can fly at the same hight as US flag,\u201d says one Facebook post, misspelling height, and featuring images of the Texas and U.S. flags side by side. But no such distinction exists. \u201cAll state flags can be flown at the same height as the US flag, and are routinely flown that way,\u201d Peter Ansoff, president of the North American Vexillological Association, wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

(AP) - The trailheads are empty, parking lots are quiet and gates are closed. During any other May, Glacier National Park would be abuzz as employees prepare for the busy tourist season that is just a few weeks a way. But this is unlike any other year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Glacier Park has been closed for over a month because of the coronavirus pandemic, and at this point it appears it will remain closed until at least the end of May with a staged opening sometime after that. But when it does finally open, all signs point to it being a summer unlike any other in the park's history. Evidence of that came last week when the Glacier Park Boat Co. announced that it would not open this year. People with reservations for boat rides this summer will be able to transfer their reservation to next summer at a 10% discount or get a full refund.</p><p>This is the first time since World War II that boat tours will not be offered in the park, said Glacier Park Boat Co. owner Scott Burch.</p><p>Burch said he made the decision not to open for a number of reasons, the Flathead Beacon reported. One was that practicing social distancing on a small boat - with just one way on and one way off and a limited number of seats - would be nearly impossible. Rules regarding employee housing in the park meant there wouldn't be enough room for all of his regular employees in the dorms. And even simple tasks like buying a ticket or helping a passenger board a boat would be complicated. There was also the question of whether or not people would want to ride a boat.</p><p>\"Even if the park opens up this summer, no one really knows what the situation will look like,\" he said. \"We're in survival mode, but we're also trying to be socially responsible... I don't want anyone in the Glacier Park Boat Co. to be exposed to the coronavirus.\"</p><p>While the historic boats will not be taking passengers, they will likely be on the water at some point this year, said Operations Manager Tyrel Johnson. That's because if there's a forest fire there is simply no way to protect the boat inside the onshore boathouse.</p><p>\"We can protect a boat in the water, but we can't protect it in the boathouse,\" Johnson said.</p><p>Xanterra Parks &amp; Resorts, operator of lodges inside the park as well as the popular Red Bus tours, is also trying to figure out what the 2020 season will look like. Marc Ducharme, general manager for Glacier National Parks Lodges, said if Xanterra does open, it will be a delayed start. The earliest any of its services would begin in the park is June 15. The company previously planned to have the lodges open in May and early June.</p><p>At this point, it's unclear when Glacier Park will open anyway. Superintendent Jeff Mow said reopening the park would be a joint decision with state, tribal and local officials.</p><p>Presently, about 160 people are working in the park, completing essential duties like gillnetting invasive lake trout and taking care of carcasses and other attractants in public places (areas with services and buildings). Officials want to make sure that bears waking up from their winter slumber to a human-less Glacier Park don't get too used to it.</p><p>Mow said that the park would likely be offering fewer services this year than in past years. Because of rules surrounding social distancing, the park and concessioners will not be able to house as many employees as they normally would, and some campgrounds will probably not open at all.</p><p>Work is also continuing to clear the Going-to-the-Sun Road. Mow said it's considered an essential task for a number of reasons, mostly because park officials don't want heavy-tracked equipment to be running directly on bare pavement for fear that it will damage it. But there's also an economic reason.</p><p>\"It's important for us to do what we can for the economic recovery, and everyone I've talked to wants the Sun Road open,\" he said. \"If there is one thing that says 'Glacier National Park is open,' it's having the Sun Road open.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-909569bbc73be04ebeafc33103ff1b59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YVY-XMF1-JC65-50Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><timeReceived>2:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

(Tyson was convicted and ended up serving three years of a six-year prison sentence.)</p><p>In 2005, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown, the principal target of harsh criticism of the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina, was relieved of his onsite command.</p><p>In 2013, four days of vehicular gridlock began near the George Washington Bridge when two of three approach lanes from Fort Lee, New Jersey, were blocked off; the traffic jam was later blamed on loyalists to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie over the refusal of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (SAHK\u2019-oh-lich) to endorse Christie for re-election. (Two political insiders were convicted for their roles in the closure; a unanimous Supreme Court later threw out the convictions. Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures, but the episode helped derail his 2016 presidential bid.)</p><p>In 2014, Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.</p><p>In 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, described half of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201ca basket of deplorables,\u201d a characterization for which she would end up expressing regret.</p><p>Ten years ago: A natural gas pipeline explosion killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California. Iran said it would free Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held for more than 13 months on spying accusations, as an act of clemency to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. (Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were sentenced in August 2011 to eight years in prison, but were released the following month.)</p><p>Five years ago: Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning monarch in British history, serving as sovereign for 23,226 days (about 63 years and 7 months), according to Buckingham Palace, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. New York became the first U.S. city to require salt warnings on chain-restaurant menus.</p><p>One year ago: Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped South Korean crew members alive from a cargo ship, more than a day after the ship overturned as it left a port in Brunswick, Georgia. President Donald Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were now \u201cdead,\u201d two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders. The acting chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the agency had likely violated its scientific integrity rules by publicly chastising a weather office that had contradicted Trump concerning a hurricane threat to Alabama.</p><p>Today\u2019s Birthdays: Actor Topol is 85.

Christie denied any prior knowledge of the lane closures, but the episode helped derail his 2016 presidential bid.)</p><p>In 2014, Apple unveiled its long-anticipated smartwatch as well as the next generation of its iPhone.</p><p>In 2016, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, speaking at an LGBT fundraiser in New York City, described half of Republican Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201ca basket of deplorables,\u201d a characterization for which she would end up expressing regret.</p><p>Ten years ago: A natural gas pipeline explosion killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California. Iran said it would free Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held for more than 13 months on spying accusations, as an act of clemency to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. (Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal were sentenced in August 2011 to eight years in prison, but were released the following month.)</p><p>Five years ago: Queen Elizabeth II became the longest reigning monarch in British history, serving as sovereign for 23,226 days (about 63 years and 7 months), according to Buckingham Palace, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. New York became the first U.S. city to require salt warnings on chain-restaurant menus.</p><p>One year ago: Coast Guard rescuers pulled four trapped South Korean crew members alive from a cargo ship, more than a day after the ship overturned as it left a port in Brunswick, Georgia. President Donald Trump said peace talks with the Taliban were now \u201cdead,\u201d two days after he abruptly canceled a secret meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders. The acting chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the agency had likely violated its scientific integrity rules by publicly chastising a weather office that had contradicted Trump concerning a hurricane threat to Alabama.</p><p>Today\u2019s Birthdays: Actor Topol is 85.

With state economies starting to come back online, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/morgan-stanley-suggests-buys-on-ambrella-nvidia-western-digital/\">pent-up demand </url> ready to express itself in the grandest fashion, and $1,200 checks burning a hole in the collective pockets of long-denied American shoppers, diners, and patrons of various sorts, the stock market should come surging back, right? ...right? Well, that's leading some to get a wicked case of a new and altogether familiar mental disorder: FOMO, or the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/yolo-fomo-and-your-retirement-plan/\">Fear Of Missing Out </url>. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) recently revealed information that that's not a good sign in this market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But FOMO is Just Greed, Right? What, Was Gordon Gekko Wrong??</emphasis></p><p>Right now, classic lines about how greed is good are likely echoing through investors' heads. Greed also does wonders in terms of improving stock market values, and given the plunge we've seen over the last few months, anything that lights a fire under this market can't be all bad. </p><p>But the word from Morgan Stanley Investment Management's head of global <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/morgan-stanley-asks-e-trade-to-dance/\">balanced risk control </url> strategy, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/investor-fear-of-missing-out-not-a-good-sign-for-the-markets-morgan-stanley.html\">Andrew Harmstone </url>, suggests otherwise. He claims, shockingly enough, that FOMO here is actually a very bad sign of things to come. </p><p>The recent gains, and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/morgan-stanley-its-about-time-virgin-galactic-saw-a-correction/\">FOMO </url> that comes along with them, come at a pretty bad time for the markets, Harmstone notes. Essentially, investors are ignoring the damage that's been done already, and are of the mind that recovery will start fairly quickly as we reopen the economy and send things back on an upward curve to where we were back in, say, January. </p><p>Basically, Harmstone suggests that investors are being overly optimistic, hoping that the recent lockdown relentings seen across the country are part of the package toward getting us all back to something much closer to normal than we saw in the last half of March and all of April. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Smoke Clears, and...Oh My....</emphasis></p><p>The problem with that notion, of course, is that this is a lot like the smoke clearing after a forest fire. Now we can see what the actual damage looks like, and that damage is likely to be a lot more extensive than anyone expects. </p><p>Businesses have been closed, or operating under so many ridiculous strictures that they might as well have been closed, but were paying employees, rent, and utilities anyway. One of the first things we're likely to see as the country opens back up is bankruptcies and lots of them. We've already seen J. Crew <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/sources-neiman-marcus-moves-to-launch-bankruptcy-protections/\">file for bankruptcy </url>, and recent word noted that Neiman Marcus finally pulled the trigger on its own bankruptcy case. Throw in shaky demand amid massive unemployment and it might be a worse picture than expected. </p><p>That isn't to say these businesses that file bankruptcy will be going away <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-this-the-week-neiman-marcus-files-bankruptcy/\">Chapter 11 bankruptcy </url> is notorious for giving companies a way back from the brink but healthy companies with hearty bottom lines typically do not file for bankruptcy. These companies, and others like them, are likely to end up taking downgrades at the analyst level, and the market will almost certainly respond accordingly. That's going to mean another downward leg for businesses post-coronavirus. Harmstone notes that volatility is likely to remain  extremely high , so sitting things out a little while longer may pay off in the long run. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disaster, But Maybe Not Complete Disaster</emphasis></p><p>Essentially, what Harmstone seems to suggest here is that investors are piling back in just a little too fast, thinking we've hit the lows and it's only up from here. Rather, Harmstone thinks that there's still more low to go before the upward swing kicks in, so those who invest now are buying into the last dogleg down rather than the upswing. </p><p>It's not that that's such a bad thing after all, investors still own the shares that are likely to climb but rather, it's more a matter of timing than anything. The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/viacom-cbs-is-a-buy/\"> market recovery  </url>is likely to come; there's enough pent-up demand out there after being shut up for two months for it to not, and though unemployment is spiraling out of control right now, the idea of it recovering once the government gets out of the way and lets places reopen with the right precautions of course is not out of line. </p><p>Remaining a bit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/roll-stock--should-you-buy-before-or-after-this-weeks-earnings-report/\">defensive </url> yet can be a hard pill to swallow, but given the market right now, it's not such a bad idea to keep a low profile for a little while longer. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-m4345368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CW-M501-DXK2-M3MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 American Banking and Market News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Banking and Market News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 7, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

(AP) \u2014 The trail along Straight Creek climbs gradually for nearly 3 miles, plodding above small waterfalls, riffles and pools before making a beeline to a shallow ford.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ease of the hike to that point is quickly replaced by a 2-mile juggernaut of switchbacks and pitches, through forests and avalanche chutes, until breaking into a stunning mountain amphitheater called Honeymoon Basin. Marmots and ground squirrels whistle and chirp from rockslides and butterflies swarm from vibrant meadows as the trail wanders through timber\u2019s edge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cresting the basin offers a clear view of the lookout on the top of Patrol Mountain, providing the inspiration needed to make a final trudge on weary legs. There, a black-and-white border collie mix named Mae tells the world of the impending visitors\u2019 arrival. The only one there to hear is Samsara Duffey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Helena native and current West Yellowstone resident stood outside Patrol Mountain Lookout in mid-August, her 25th year atop this mountain on the eastern edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Rains had finally cleared \u201ca lookout\u2019s nightmare\u201d of persistent smoky skies, revealing the expanses of forests and parks, craggy mountains and serrated reefs of the Bob and Scapegoat.</p><p>At her feet, Mae surveys the overlook to the west before finding a comfortable place to doze.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll either go all day or nap all day,\u201d Duffey quips.</p><p>Only an occasional radio crackle or screech from a circling red-tailed hawk breaks the windless afternoon. The last hikers Duffey saw in person were nearly three weeks earlier; visitor traffic has waned with the smoke.</p><p>\u201cI like to share this with people,\u201d she told the <url normalizedValue=\"https://helenair.com/outdoors/life-on-patrol-mountain-helena-native-reflects-on-25-years-at-bob-marshall-fire-lookout/article_450cfc9b-c593-5e48-ac67-c7d8e9d33766.html#tracking-source=home-top-story\">Montana State News Bureau</url>. \u201cI like to share the solitude, the experiences, the landscape, the people that love the areas, so I see that as a very important part of my job.\u201d</p><p>In 1997 Duffey was a college student looking for a summer job. Her outdoorsy upbringing ran deep with her older sister already working as the lookout at Prairie Reef to the north. Duffey\u2019s sister told her the lookout at Patrol Mountain needed a volunteer. Duffey made the call.</p><p>She came back the next year, and then the next.</p><p>\u201cEvery year at least in the early years there were slightly different things that got me coming back and now it\u2019s just what I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I started it was easy, then we had a few big fire years and I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m actually making a difference in early detection of fires and I\u2019m actually able to help the fire crew.\u2019 In addition it\u2019s just an absolutely wonderful place and it\u2019s just become very, very comfortable to come back here every year.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cBig Burn\u201d of 1910 triggered a major push by the Forest Service to locate and put out fires quickly. At one time lookouts, some of them nothing more than tent camps, were positioned every 11 to 13 miles \u2013 28 total across the Rocky Mountain Front. Only a handful remain today.</p><p>Duffey loves the history of lookouts and actively works to preserve that history with the Forest Fire Lookout Association. She sees their unmistakable romanticism, a symbol of protection in a landscape defined by the whims of nature.</p><p>This is the second lookout to sit at 8,000 feet atop Patrol Mountain. The first went up in the early 1920s and the Forest Service built the current structure in 1962. The cozy confines of the inside with a bed, bookshelf, desk, table and wood stove are offset by window-lined walls looking in all directions to the vastness of the wilderness. Outside, the structure bears evidence of decades in high altitude elements where the lifespan of a coat of paint is only about a year.</p><p>\u201cI do think about the history of lookouts and the tradition of lookouts and how the job has changed over time, and how it hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said, noting that many visitors remark on the \u201ctime capsule\u201d feeling of stepping inside. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s that same continuity with the landscape, with the mountain, that we\u2019re still doing what we started out doing.\u201d</p><p>Duffey details the ebb and flow of their popularity among land managers. The question of whether changes in technology can replace staffed lookouts has always been part of the conversation around them.</p><p>She believes no technology can fully replicate the efficiency of a lookout that can spot smoke from a single tree. The cost of even a short patrol flight or purchasing and maintaining a remote camera is roughly equal to her seasonal salary.</p><p>\u201cLike the rest of society, we need to figure out how to incorporate that type of technology to help us do a better job and not see that technology, and I really hope fire managers don\u2019t start seeing that technology as replacing, but as being complementary and then incorporating it into the work,\u201d she said.</p><p>Duffey can easily survey the landscape for miles looking for the faintest sign of smoke. She is vigilant after thunderstorms but has also come to know where campers tend to make fires that can unexpectedly come back to life. Once a fire is observed, she uses an Osborne Fire Finder \u2013 a piece of equipment designed more than a hundred years ago \u2013 to estimate the fire\u2019s position for dispatch.</p><p>The role of a lookout also goes far beyond simply spotting and reporting fires, she said, including meeting with the public, relaying radio messages and keeping detailed radio logs. Duffey often steps away to check in with trail crews, packers or other lookouts as a matter of safety and coordination. For many visitors, she may be their only interaction with a Forest Service employee and wants that experience to be positive.</p><p>The lookout lifestyle is not for everyone. Visitors typically rave about the idea of the job, but once Duffey explains that groceries only arrive by packstring every three weeks and hikers may number 10 or less in a given month, their enthusiasm tempers.</p><p>\u201cUsually by the time people leave they\u2019re like, \u2018This is really cool, but I don\u2019t think I could be alone for that long, I don\u2019t think I could have that kind of isolation for that long,\u2019\u201d she said.</p><p>While not all lookouts are as remote as Patrol Mountain, new staff often struggle with the isolation as well in what she calls a \u201creverse cabin fever.\u201d The first week is marked by excitement followed by the realization of isolation before accepting the experience for what it is. Duffey went through the same progression early on.</p><p>\u201cThe way we are in society, we are not as Americans encouraged to be independent, alone, comfortable with solitude, comfortable with isolation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really given most of those tools as we grow up so it does take some adjustment.\u201d</p><p>When not at the lookout Duffey works as a guide in West Yellowstone. Her husband works as a smokejumper, which allows their seasonal work to mesh. They talk as often as the spotty cell service of their locations allows.</p><p>\u201cIt really is easy for us,\u201d she says.</p><p>Duffey jokes that by February she has already started planning what to bring to Patrol Mountain that summer. By March she begins counting down the days.</p><p>\u201cIn a lot of ways after my first couple of years up here it\u2019s easier to come up here than it is to come back to town,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I go home, there\u2019s noise, there\u2019s perfumes, there\u2019s hustle and bustle, there\u2019s a whole lot of inputs really fast and those inputs are exhausting.\u201d</p><p>While others have certainly worked for 25 years or more as a lookout, such longevity at a single location is rare, Duffey says. Pointing to the northwest, she talks about her love of hiking and the fact that she has set foot on nearly every trail or ridge she is responsible for monitoring.</p><p>Reflecting on 25 years, Duffey ponders the question of change. Certainly the fire scars alter the appearance of a mountainside, trees have died from disease or insects, but the years have largely melded together. On a given day she might notice a boulder has rolled down the mountainside or a whitebark pine produced plentiful cones this summer, or wonder if an unexpected snowdrift indicates a shift in prevailing winter winds.</p><p>Rodents make up most of her daily wildlife, although she rattles off an impressive list of much rarer sightings including wolverines, lynx, bobcat, mountain lion, black and grizzly bears, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep and mountain goats. She loves watching the weather, speculating that she might have been a meteorologist had she chosen a different career. She points miles away to the Danaher Basin, describing how storms can build in the backcountry and move across the landscape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice because it is a huge chunk of time but there\u2019s not a lot of drama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the little things like that that really stick out as the different years. There really is something comforting about the lack of change, the consistency.\u201d</p><p>Duffey is not looking to abandon her post any time soon.</p><p>When asked how long she wants to remain Patrol Mountain\u2019s only resident, she said \u201cAs long as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no plans not to come back,\u201d she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-08db9ad7e199de7a821cc84d2b50565320210906</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63J7-6531-JC5B-G479-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1481\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Ash falling from the sky. Blazes decimating wildlife and towns. Charred cars. Homes burned to the ground. It all sounds incredibly apocalyptic, yet it's been reality for me and millions of others across the West Coast for the past few weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since late August, there's been an ever-constant cloud of smoke blanketing the sky, meaning that my home state of California - often called \"the Sunshine State\" - has scarcely seen any sunshine in the past month. The Air Quality Index rating in my area has been in the unhealthy range for so many days that I've lost count. My family and I usually enjoy going on daily walks around the neighborhood, but in the past few weeks, I've barely ventured out.</p><p>I've lived in California my entire life, and I've never seen anything like this before.</p><p>Wildfires weren't even really on my radar until 2017, when I was a junior in high school. Back in 2017, 9,000 wildfires raged across California, and for a few days that fall, my tennis team was unable to practice due to unhealthy air quality. The same thing happened the next year, in 2018, when our matches were canceled due to another batch of wildfires.</p><p>At the time, 2018 was the worst fire season that California had ever seen. But that's nothing compared to what we're seeing today. And what's ironic is that before 2018, 2017 was California's worst fire season.</p><p>In 2018, 1.8 million acres burned across California. To date, that number stands at more than 3 million acres for 2020, and we're barely into September and October - two months that have historically seen the most devastating wildfires in the state.</p><p>Six of California's 20 largest fires in history occurred this year. Firefighters remark that they're battling wildfires on scales they've never seen before. Today's wildfires are shattering records - the kind no one wants to break.</p><p>We should have seen this coming.</p><p>We've pushed away climate change as a problem for future generations for far too long. Sorry to break it to you, but climate change is here. We've made our world so inhabitable that we have to remain indoors and keep our windows shut so we won't be poisoned by the smoke in the skies. Everything is coming to a boil, and it's all happening faster than we ever would have thought.</p><p>As California Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC Nightly News, \"California, the West Coast of the United States - that includes Washington and obviously Oregon - are experiencing what people predicted would occur in 2040, 2050, but we're experiencing it today.\"</p><p>A 2016 study found that human-caused climate change accounted for more than half of documented increases in aridity in the western U.S. since the 1970s, as well as the doubling of cumulative forest fire area since 1984. According to climate scientists, the use of fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gas emissions that induce high temperatures. Then, heat waves exacerbate wildfires by drying out vegetation and keeping temperatures up. And dryer autumns are never a good sign when it comes to fires.</p><p>Compounding the effects of climate change, California has failed to manage its land properly since it does not practice enough controlled burns per year. Such controlled burns eliminate excess shrubbery that may fuel fires. While Indigenous communities traditionally held controlled burns to prevent wildfires from breaking out, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reserves the sole right to manage fires and does not hold an adequate number of prescribed burns to prevent fires.</p><p>Additionally, the inmate firefighter crews usually tasked with fighting wildfires have been understaffed this year due to COVID-19. As part of Newsom's early release program during the pandemic, 8,000 prisoners were released early so that they would not be exposed to the virus in high-density locations like prisons, where it is easy for coronavirus to spread.</p><p>California's smoky skies should be a wakeup call for us to take action before it's too late. We shouldn't depend on incarcerated people to fight our fires; it's highly unethical. We can also learn a lot from the indigenous people who called California home long before the Europeans came: about how they valued their land and preserved precious ecosystems.</p><p>We need to significantly alter our ways of life by conserving energy when possible and rethinking transportation. Furthermore, fossil fuels just won't cut it anymore. We must invest in solar and other forms of sustainable energy, while re-engineering systems to use renewable energy.</p><p>The climate crisis is not just isolated to California - we're seeing the same images in Washington and Oregon as well. What's happening on the West Coast is only a sign of what's to come. This is our reckoning.</p><p>Michelle Lum HM '23 is from San Jose, California. She has fond memories of visiting Big Basin Redwoods State Park, and is devastated by the destruction of millions of acres of land across the West Coast due to the wildfires of the past few years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4744744</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TW-K121-DY7P-T040-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Student Life: Pomona College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 12, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Claremont</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001885</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY MONITORING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001707</classCode><className>TENNIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DN7U</classCode><className>GAVIN NEWSOM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

What do you think happened?</p><p>GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Well, low vaccination rates.</p><p>And you hit it right, Jake, that this is a pivotal moment in our race against the COVID virus. We have school coming up. We have a lot of sports activities that people are expecting and anxious about. And it's important for normalcy.</p><p>And what's holding us back is a low vaccination rate. We're doing all that we can. And I made the decision that it's really not what the government can tell you to do, but it is the community and their engagement and citizens talking to other citizens and trusted advisers, whether it's medical community or whether it's employers. Those are key.</p><p>That's why I'm having these town hall meetings. It's more than listening. It is really engaging the community. And, so far, we have seen a 40 percent increase in our vaccinations since we started this.</p><p>TAPPER: Your daily case count is higher now than it was when you first required masks statewide a year ago.</p><p>In April, you signed a law that prohibits local or state officials yourself, including from implementing any new mask mandates. That ban goes into effect this week.</p><p>Why have a ban on mask mandates, when you're having difficulty as a state getting control of this pandemic?</p><p>HUTCHINSON: Well, that was the will of the General Assembly. I signed it.</p><p>At that point, we had very low case rates in Arkansas, and people knew exactly what to do. They were capable of making their decisions. And then we shifted to the emphasis on vaccination. And I really think it's important not to have the current debate about mask-wearing, but to have the current emphasis on getting a vaccine.</p><p>And so that's the singular focus we have, even though our guidelines continue to say, if you're not vaccinated, you should wear a mask. And that is the guideline that we have in place. But we don't have a mandate, because that was held back from the legislature. As you pointed out, I signed that.</p><p>And as we get ready for school, I think more people will be looking at that guideline as that's appropriate if you're not vaccinated or you're under 12.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to play some of the video posted by Washington Regional Medical Center in Arkansas about the rise in serious cases that they're seeing among unvaccinated young people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. MICHAEL BOLDING, ARKANSAS WASHINGTON REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER: The regret and remorse on their face, and fear, that look on a patient's face, I promise you, would be more motivating than anything to go ahead and get your vaccine, if you have not already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAPPER: Do you think you underestimated how vaccine-hesitant and skeptical the citizens of Arkansas were going to be?</p><p>And why is there such reluctance to trust in this miracle science?</p><p>HUTCHINSON: Well, I don't know if I underestimated it, but, certainly, the resistance has hardened in certain elements, and is simply false information.</p><p>It is myths. As I go into these town hall meetings, someone said: Don't call it a vaccine. Call it a bioweapon. And they talk about mind control.</p><p>Well, those are obviously erroneous. Other members of the community correct that.</p><p>But what you see in that in that ad, the message from Washington Regional Medical Center is very critical. We are seeing younger adults go into the hospital. And people of Arkansas and across the nation respond to risk. And whenever the risk of the COVID and the hospitalization was low, vaccinations slowed down.</p><p>Now you're seeing a high escalation of the vaccines because people are measuring the risk. You're seeing it younger, at a younger age. We have had two adolescents pass away because of COVID. And these are alarm bells for everyone that follows this.</p><p>So, our goal, get information out, help them to make the right decision, push the vaccination, and, hopefully, we will be ready for school within the next month.</p><p>TAPPER: Your fellow Southern Republican Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama had really voiced some frustration with people refusing to get vaccinated.</p><p>She said -- quote -- \"It's time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks for letting us down.\"</p><p>Do you agree with her?</p><p>HUTCHINSON: Well, you got to understand that she's expressing her frustration that everyone feels.</p><p>But, at the same time, I don't want to get distracted into causing division. Let's pull together. And it's -- people can change your mind. Even though there's a very hardened resistance, it's a small percent. And there's more that come to the town meeting that are trying to get information, that they have put it off or they're hesitant. They're worried about health consequences.</p><p>And so that's where you have a community physician that answers the questions, and that is persuadable. And so we're seeing people that were previously resistant or hesitant about it coming in and getting the vaccination.</p><p>That should be the focus, and not trying to divide our communities.</p><p>TAPPER: But do you worry at all that, by not allowing localities to impose a mask mandate, when this virus continues to rage like a wildfire, as your own experts say, you are actually ceding control of this virus to the unvaccinated, to the people who ask questions about mind control that you just talked about, instead of giving power and control to the people who are taking this seriously, who are getting vaccinated, but don't want to have vulnerable people, like those under 12 or those who have immune system problems, infected by those who are just ignoring the science?</p><p>HUTCHINSON: There's two mandates that are possible.</p><p>One would be a vaccine mandate. We're not going to do that, because that would even cause a greater reaction of negativity toward the government and that imposition on freedom. Secondly would be a mandate for wearing masks.</p><p>It is a conservative principle to allow for local control. That is a fair discussion about it. And that's something we're going to have to continue to weigh, depending upon vaccination rates and how they proceed between now and school.</p><p>But that is a legislative prohibition on having a mask mandate even in our schools. And so that will only change if the legislature comes back together and yields to that local control. I think that is something that will be a continued point of discussion between now and the time school starts.</p><p>But you have got to worry, Jake, that, one, you're not going to be able to enforce it very well. The schools are in a better position to do it. But then, also, you have got parents who generally worry about the mental health of their child and whether that's the right reaction to it and whether that's going to cause more problems or alleviate it, when there's a low risk for that age group.</p><p>And that's something we're continuing to get data on as to whether -- what is the risk for that age group? We need to get everybody else around that young child vaccinated. That's the cocoon, that's the protection that we need to provide them as we go back to school.</p><p>TAPPER: I'm praying for the people of Arkansas. Best of luck getting the people of Arkansas vaccinated.</p><p>Governor, thanks for joining us today.</p><p>HUTCHINSON: Thank you, Jake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECWIR-9200004611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECWIR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:562Y-N871-F06P-21Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Data Licensing, LLC.

The 113 patients admitted in the past 24 hours also was the highest seen since the virus surfaced in Iowa in March. The number of patients needing intensive care unit services has also trended upward in the past month.</p><p>Iowa doctors and hospital officials are preparing for a system overrun by COVID patients by talking about how to transfer patients between hospitals and enacting surge plans that could turn non-hospital facilities into spots to handle any overflow.</p><p>\u201cWhat we know is if the last four weeks are indicative of what happens over the next four weeks we will have the system overwhelmed,\u201d said Suresh Gunasekaran, CEO of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. \u201cIf hospitalizations continue to increase at the exact same rate they have been for weeks, the math itself tells you that you run out of beds.\u201d</p><p>University hospitals, the state's only academic medical center, is often where other hospitals send patients with complex intensive care needs. It is seeing a significant volume of COVID-19 patients from around the state, Gunasekaran said.</p><p>He said Iowans need to understand that the coronavirus patient surge often displaces the ability to care for patients with other complex needs stemming from problems such as heart disease, cancer or neurological conditions.</p><p>State public health officials reported 1,814 new confirmed cases Wednesday and an additional 22 deaths for a total of 1,680.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 249, an increase of nearly 23%, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Iowa has averaged about 1,400 new cases a day for the past week.</p><p>\u201cMy take away from this is that things are bad but also they can and will likely get much worse because the number of new cases is just staggering,\u201d said Dr. Rosanna Rosa, an infectious disease doctor with UnityPoint Health.</p><p>A spokesman for the Iowa Department of Public Health said the state is in regular, often daily, contact with health systems, hospitals and regional medical coordination centers to assess hospital capacity, staffing and resources.</p><p>\u201cAt this time, hospitals are reporting that they are able to manage the increased number of patients, and are prepared to implement surge plans to expand capacity if necessary,\u201d spokesman Alex Carfrae wrote in an email.</p><p>He said staffing shortages can occur during times of seasonal illness or viral outbreaks and hospitals have a variety of solutions to maintain adequate staffing levels.</p><p>Rosa said a better public health approach would be to make it clear to Iowans that these illnesses and deaths are preventable, a point made in a recent report from the White House Coronavirus Task Force when it recommended Iowa enact mask requirements and limit crowd sizes.</p><p>Gov. Kim Reynolds has rejected a mask mandate.</p><p>State data indicates a 14-county region in the southeast corner of Iowa has fewer than 19% of its hospital beds available, but a doctor at a major hospital in the region said even that can be deceiving because there aren't always enough nurses and other necessary staff to tend to the beds that may appear to be available. Beds to be usable must have available doctors, nurses, physician assistants and respiratory technicians and when they get sick or must be quarantined, hospitals may not be able to put a patient in some of the beds due to staff shortages.</p><p>\u201cWe've got a lot of hospital staff that are getting infected in the community and getting exposed and having symptoms and not being able to be at work,\u201d said Dr. Michael McCoy, chief medical officer at Great River Health in Burlington.</p><p>MercyOne hospitals in the Des Moines area have seen an increase in COVID patient numbers in the past month and now have around 30 to 40 patients, said Dr. Ravi Vemuri, an infectious disease specialist. He likened Iowa's coronavirus experience to a smoldering forest fire that never went out and occasionally flares.</p><p>He said Iowa likely opened things up too aggressively in May, which allowed virus activity to begin spreading again and gain momentum through the summer.

He likened Iowa's coronavirus experience to a smoldering forest fire that never went out and occasionally flares.</p><p>He said Iowa likely opened things up too aggressively in May, which allowed virus activity to begin spreading again and gain momentum through the summer. The only answer is for Iowans to again limit activity by staying within their family bubble and when going outside the family unit they must wear a mask and remain distant from others, especially when indoors.</p><p>\u201cRight at this moment we're sitting OK but as cases accelerate we might get into trouble,\u201d he said.</p><p>Hospitalizations lag behind positivity numbers by a week to 10 days so the very high positive case numbers will lead to more people in hospitals.</p><p>Gunasekaran said it's imperative for the community to work now to flatten momentum of new cases.</p><p>\u201cIf the curve is going to continue to peak we will have a health care system that does get overwhelmed. It is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe specter that's hanging over our head going into the winter is if we continue to see these kinds of hospitalization rates, will we really take care of all the patients that we want to? That's what\u2019s worrying me.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-f3aa4ee6b9414dd3621c634c4ab1aeca20201028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:615J-1S01-JC5B-G1W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"890\"/><timeReceived>10:33 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

Phil Scott announced Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Outpatient clinics and surgeries may resume if the providers and the patients comply with measures designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elective surgeries that require a hospital stay are not yet allowed, the governor said at his weekly news conference.</p><p>The resumption of some medical care and other aspects of the state's reopening is made possible by Vermont's expanded program to test for new cases of the virus and try to stop its spread.</p><p>\"As we find an outbreak, like a brush fire, we are able to put it out before an out-of-control forest fire erupts,\" Scott said.</p><p>Separately Monday, more Vermont construction and manufacturing workers returned to their jobs after Scott loosened some restrictions.</p><p>Crews of as many as 10 people may now be on the job as long as they abide by safety measures. Those businesses may expand to full operation on May 11 if they comply with additional safety requirements, Scott said.</p><p>In other developments:</p><p>EXPANDED TESTING AND TRACING</p><p>Vermont Secretary of Human Services Secretary Michael Smith said the new focus on expanded testing of even people who do not show symptoms of COVID-19 and the tracing of the contacts of new cases has helped change the nature of the public health fight against the coronavirus.</p><p>\"We are going out and hunting for this virus and using it whenever we find hot spots, through tracing, through testing, to really pounce on trying to contain this virus,\" Smith said during the governor's briefing.</p><p>___</p><p>REGIONAL BUYERS GROUP</p><p>Scott said Monday he was surprised to learn about the seven-state group to buy personal protective equipment and other medical equipment that was announced Sunday by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>The consortium announced by Cuomo will create a regional supply chain for masks, gowns, ventilators, testing supplies and other equipment vital to fighting the disease.</p><p>Last month, after Cuomo proposed an earlier buying consortium, New York did not initially reach out to Vermont, but the next day New York officials reached out to Vermont to apologize, Scott said.</p><p>\"We said at that point, we'd love to be a part of at least being at the table to understand what they're doing,\" Scott said, because what happens in New York does affect neighboring Vermont.</p><p>He said he didn't have an answer as to why they weren't included.</p><p>\"It's probably an oversight in that they didn't include us, but at this point we're trying to work with other states here in our region as well,\" Scott said.</p><p>A spokesman for Cuomo did not immediately return an email seeking comment.</p><p>Separately, Vermont officials have said they have been able to find sufficient stocks of protective equipment and virus testing supplies and Vermont has been working with other states.</p><p>___</p><p>CORRECTIONS</p><p>The Vermont Department of Corrections says a second round of testing of 155 inmates and 154 staff at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans found seven new positive inmates and one positive staff member.</p><p>They were all in a section of the prison that only housed inmates who had been potentially exposed to 38 inmates who had previously tested positive for the virus.</p><p>All inmates who tested positive were transferred to the Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, where they could be isolated together.</p><p>So far, 45 inmates have tested positive at Northwest State. Of those, 23 have recovered and returned to the St. Albans prison. Four have been released. Eighteen, including the seven new cases, are isolated in St. Johnsbury.</p><p>\"It is too early to fully understand the data we are receiving on test results, but early indications are that the unprecedented infrastructure built to manage the pandemic is showing success,\" interim Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker said in a statement.</p><p>___</p><p>NUMBERS</p><p>The Vermont Department of Health on Monday reported five new cases of the virus as the total topped 900. The number of deaths held steady at 52.</p><p>For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-85331ec765bfd6e4c317e52b582c754d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTX-2MN1-JC65-53P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><timeReceived>9:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

He moved out here from Pennsylvania years ago, works as a chemist but also has a small vegetable operation on this 5-acre plot. He intends to plant grapes here in the fall, but for now it\u2019s an excellent place to park an RV.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I just made coffee on the camp stove. It\u2019s a little strange to be wearing layers of flannel shirts, long pants and warm socks in the middle of July, but I can see my breath as the sun slowly climbs up from the horizon. My wife and kids are still nestled in the RV behind me, although my wife has to get up soon for her morning meetings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the challenges of this trip has been keeping her connected to Wi-Fi so she can work full time from the road as well.</p><p>Looking Glass seems like a fitting place to reflect on our trip. There are a couple big things that stand out for me from our journey so far.</p><p>The first is just how big and beautiful this country is. We have literally traveled from sea to shining sea \u2014 from the barrier islands on the Mid-Atlantic coast to the rocky coves of the Pacific Northwest. From the Piedmont to the Appalachians, across mighty rivers and great plains, through the Rockies and the deserts, to the forests fires and farmland of the West, we\u2019ve traversed the grand open space and witnessed the natural beauty of America.</p><p>A country curious about hemp</p><p>Besides the physical beauty of America, there has been another beauty that I can\u2019t quite describe, but it has to do with the people we\u2019ve met along the way. I try to talk to as many people as I can \u2014 when I\u2019m filling up the tank at a gas station, I\u2019ll strike up a conversation with someone at the next pump, or the cashier at a grocery store, or our neighbors in the campground.</p><p>A giant RV with the Lancaster Farming Industrial Hemp Podcast logo plastered on the back is sort of a conversation starter. People are curious about what we\u2019re doing and why.</p><p>When I tell people that I\u2019m traveling around talking to hemp farmers and processors and entrepreneurs, they light up \u2014 the deli guy at the Kroger in Kentucky, the campground attendant at the KOA in Colorado, the trucker at a coffee shop in Kansas. People are curious and excited about hemp, and most people can\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not already making our consumer goods out of hemp.</p><p>They like to tell me what they know about hemp, how in the old days we made rope and sails from hemp, or how Henry Ford built a car from hemp in the 1940s, or how the pioneers made homespun clothing from hemp. When I explain that all of these things and much more are entirely within the realm of possibility, but that we lack the infrastructure for robust processing and supply chains, they just sort of shake their heads.</p><p>And when I talk about hemp\u2019s ability to remediate soil and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, they are even more interested yet surprised that it\u2019s taken so long to get this industry off the ground. Me too.</p><p>Last week, at the Mesa Verde KOA, I was under the gun to get my story written and sent off to my editor before we had to check out of the campground at 11 a.m. Around 11:30, as I was clacking away on my keyboard at the picnic table at our camp site, Tracey from the main office drove up on a golf cart to see why we hadn\u2019t checked out yet. Turns out she and her husband are from Pennsylvania, had moved out to Colorado many years ago, and have friends back home who read Lancaster Farming. Small world.</p><p>I told her about the tour and what I was working on. I gave her a Hemp Tour hat, a T-shirt and a copy of the paper. She let me stay a little longer to finish up.</p><p>Adventures in the West</p><p>When we finally got on the road, we drove to the ancient Pueblo cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park. Fifteen hundred years ago this place was a thriving community of indigenous people living on the mesa in houses built into the cliffs. The conditions were harsh to say the least, and it\u2019s a stunning example of the resilience of people and how there\u2019s not much we can\u2019t do when we work together.</p><p>From Colorado we took U.S. Route 191 north to Moab, Utah, where we stayed at another KOA campground. Just as we were arriving, a giant storm appeared before us in the desert, and we rode that storm into town with 70 mph winds, extravagant lightning and actual tumbleweeds.</p><p>We camped two nights in Moab, trying to decide if we should go north to California like we had intended or if the huge wildfires burning along our proposed route would be enough to make us change course. We considered backtracking through Colorado, avoiding the fires and heat as much as we could.</p><p>But there was something calling us to California. Was it the Pacific Ocean? Was it the giant redwoods? I think it was both.</p><p>From Moab, we headed north through Utah, took a left at Salt Lake City, and rolled into our campsite in eastern Nevada around midnight, and rolled out again just after dawn. That was this past Saturday. We drove all day, stopping for lunch near Reno and then pressing on to Sacramento.</p><p>We were headed to Fieldbrook, Humboldt County, California, where the redwoods meet the ocean, but there was a giant forest fire smack dab in the middle of the quickest route, so instead we headed south a little and took Interstate 5 north, avoiding the fires. We could see plumes of smoke on the horizon. The landscape around Sacramento was crisp and brown the way Pennsylvania can get after a very dry fall.</p><p>After driving 15 hours across the desert, we knew that crossing the mountains to the coast in the dark was asking for trouble, so we camped at an RV park along the Sacramento River near Redding.</p><p>In the morning we made our way across the mountain range into Humboldt County \u2014 three hours of white-knuckle driving through steep and treacherous mountain passes with California sports cars whizzing past. Harrowing. That\u2019s the best word to describe what it\u2019s like to drive a giant RV through mountain passes.</p><p>We stayed with some Pennsylvania transplants, Lisa and Clark, who moved out from Berks County about 10 years ago. They let us stay in the yurt on their property and they let us borrow their car to drive out to the Pacific coast two miles away.</p><p>The water was chilly, but I swam in the ocean and my kids played in the surf while my wife strummed the ukulele on the beach. Not sure how this could have been more perfect.</p><p>We stayed in the yurt for two nights. This gave my wife a chance to catch up on her work and me to edit and publish podcast interviews from Colorado. Our hosts were gracious and generous and they made us feel at home, exactly what we needed after so many days on the road.</p><p>The road going forward</p><p>We left Tuesday morning, headed up the coastal highway toward Oregon. We were warned that the highway was closed for construction from 7 a.m. to noon, and 3 to 7 p.m., at a place called Last Chance Grade, just south of Crescent City, so we had to time it just right or we\u2019d be stuck.</p><p>We gambled with our time a little bit when we stopped at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park to see the giant trees, but luck was on our side and we made it through Last Chance Grade at 2:59, just in the nick of time.</p><p>From Oregon, we\u2019ll travel up to some fiber and grain operations in southern Washington, and then make our way to Fort Benton, where there will be a gathering of what Ken Elliot from IND HEMP calls \u201cthe movers and shakers\u201d of the hemp industry.</p><p>Next week I will report on that. Then we\u2019ll start to make our way home, stopping in Lancaster County, Nebraska, for a hemp event at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p><p>The last stop on the tour will be in New Castle, Pennsylvania, at the Project PA Hemp Home, a house built from hemp.</p><p>I know I speak for my entire family when I say we are all looking forward to getting home.</p><p>New Holland Agriculture and National Hemp Association are proud sponsors of Lancaster Farming's National Hemp Tour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWERA-1b2efb7adbba57529e959d771b117167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWERA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636N-38J1-DYRG-S14H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222875</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 LNP Media Group, Inc.

I`m Carl Azuz, happy to see you this Friday. One thing many Americans didn`t expect after a hurricane made landfall in the U.S. south was that a few days later it would cause states of emergency in the U.S. northeast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those have been declared in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York to speed up help to areas that have been dealing with record amounts of rain and flooding, and that was brought to the region by what remained of Hurricane Ida. The storm carried moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, over the eastern United States and up north to places like New York City, which for the first time was the scene of a flood emergency as declared as the National Weather Service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forecasters had warned that flash flooding, when waters rise rapidly, was possible in this area, what surprised even some meteorologists was how quickly and how severely the flooding would hit. More than seven inches of rain fell on Central Park Wednesday, most of that in a matter of hours.</p><p>It wasn`t the most rain that part of New York had ever seen, but it was in Newark, New Jersey where almost eight and a half inches fell. That`s the highest amount on record since officials started keeping track in 1889. Some homes in Connecticut were 3/4 under water on Thursday.</p><p>Emergency workers in Pennsylvania estimate there`ve been thousands of water rescues as torrential rain caused extreme flooding there. And state officials across Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania say at least 26 deaths have been blamed on the storm and the flooding it caused. That`s in addition to at least five deaths reported in Louisiana and Mississippi after Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hurricane Ida`s remnants pummeling the northeast and Mid-Atlantic unleashing torrential rain, extreme flooding, strong winds and even tornadoes throughout the region. Governors in New York and New Jersey declaring states of emergency.</p><p>GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: It is always quite shocking when you literally see the streets of New York looking like, you know, the rivers flowing and people just in shock over what`s going on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Multiple sightings of tornadoes in the Garden State.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I heard, you know, just rattling. My daughter ran out and said get in the house quick.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One confirmed tornado tearing through this town just outside of Philadelphia, destroying several homes in its path.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hear just a (inaudible). We heard everything just break.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The severe weather bringing New York City to a stand still. Heavy rains creating waterfalls rushing into subway stations and even overflowing down the stairs and onto the tracks. The dangerous conditions forcing the city to suspend all subway service leaving some riders stuck on the grounded subway cars and others stranded for hours at stations including this one in Times Square with no way to leave safely.</p><p>Some service returning close to 3 am, allowing passengers to finally go home. Record breaking rainfall and flash flooding causing the mayor to issue a state of emergency.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: What we`re hearing from different parts of the five boroughs, very troubling. We`re seeing a kind of rainfall we almost never see. This kind of speed of which the rain has come. Everyone`s got to get to safety.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The unprecedented rain turning roads and highways into rivers. The floods filling up this baggage claim area in New Jersey`s Newark Airport. The storm forcing the facility into a ground stop temporarily. Homes and apartments across multiple states filling up with water.</p><p>Fire and rescue crews finding one person dead at this flooded complex in Maryland. Outside Pittsburgh, rescue crews pulling 41 passengers trapped in flood waters on a school bus Wednesday morning, and in New York and New Jersey first responders working around the clock rescuing people stranded in their cars. Local leaders urging residents to continue to be careful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There`s no way we could have predicted how bad this storm would get. The intense rainfall, the concentration of water which can result in -- in trees coming down. Cars can be repaired. Property can be replaced, but the loss of life cannot (audio gap).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: 10 Second Trivia. Sequoya was a Cherokee Nation leader who made it possible to do what? Preserve forests, read and write in Cherokee, enrich soil or inject medicines. Sequoya created a syllabary that made it possible to write in the Cherokee language.</p><p>He`s also the namesake of the Giant Sequoia Trees that tower over California`s Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. Part of the reason why these trees can survive for thousands of years is that they often weather the wildfires that flare up here during the late summer and Fall. Despite that and the fact that fire helps prime the soil for the growth of new Sequoias, severe blazes like one that started with a lightning strike last year are still a threat.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From their size --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: General Sherman is 275 feet tall. Holy cow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- to their longevity.</p><p>CLAY JORDAN, PARK RANGER SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS: Now before ancient Rome, before Christ, I mean, these trees were -- were mature.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Much about giant Sequoia trees is on a grand scale. With that distinctive red brown bark covering their thick trunks, Sequoia trees can only be found in California`s Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p><p>SAM HODDER, CEO OF SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE: This is a resilient tree. They are tough. Almost nothing can kill them. A giant sequoia that was first weakened by drought was then subject to impacts by the bark beetle, which then further weakened the tree and potentially made it more susceptible to mortality from fire.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Stag Tree is said to be the fifth largest tree in the entire world. It`s lived more than 3,000 years and yet we`re seeing that wildfire is threatening these giant sequoias more than ever before.</p><p>JORDAN: The Castle fire was a wake-up call. An estimated 7,500 to 10,600 trees were destroyed in that one fire alone.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Started by lightening in August 2020, the Castle fire was part of the sequoia complex that burned more than 174,000 acres, scorching several sequoia groves.</p><p>CHRISTY BRIGHAM, PARK RANGER SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS: It was devastating, heartbreaking. Everything had been incinerated. It was a field of the world`s largest, burned up toothpicks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After decades of pressing forest fire, other trees and brush have grown rampantly around the sequoias.</p><p>HODDER: The fires that used to burn every five to 10 years in the Sierra would just keep down the competition, and reduce the fuel naturally.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On land owned by the Save the Redwoods League, we hiked out to see just how deadly the Castle fire was here.</p><p>TIM BORDEN, SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE: For us to see 10 to 14 percent of the total of giant sequoias alive, killed in one year, in one fire is -- there`s nothing to compare that too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yet fire, in and of itself is not the enemy of the giant sequoia.</p><p>HODDER: Their cones open up. Their seeds start to germinate after a fire.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So near those lost giants, where the fire wasn`t too intense small shoots of hope take root.</p><p>BORDEN: What I see is a lot of these little baby giant sequoias that have sprouted up since the fire happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AZUZ: The latest world record contender for the World`s Tallest Sandcastle isn`t like other sandcastles. For one thing, it was stabilized by wooden scaffolding during construction. It`s been coated with glue so it will last through the winter and it`s not on the beach. It`s not too far from the beach. This was built in a coastal village of Northern Denmark. At almost 70 feet high, it took almost five tons of sand to build and 30 artists worked to carve the details into its walls.</p><p>People often spire to build castles when they \"barbican\". \"Towering\" achievement, that depends on where you \"sand\". Takes a \"Camelot\" of time and talent to build up a sandcastle. Artistry helps \"draw the bridge\" and make it all worth the hassle. So \"port\" call us if you`re \"battlemeant\" to give the \"trial a goat\", because when it comes to castles it`s whatever \"floats your boat\". Whew. I heard from several people on social media who said they missed it when I rapped, so blame them.</p><p>Mililani High School is watching today from Mililani, Hawaii. We know that because they subscribed and left a comment at Youtube.com/cnn10. That is the only place we look for the schools we mention. We will be off Monday for the Labor Day Holiday. So we`ll look forward to see you on Tuesday for more CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
