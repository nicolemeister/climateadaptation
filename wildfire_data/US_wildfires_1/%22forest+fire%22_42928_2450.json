That's because a catastrophic fire \u2014 what scientists call a \"stand-replacing fire\" \u2014 could happen in a temperate forest like ours; historically, such fires occur every 150 to 400 years, said Derek Churchill, an islander who works as a forest health scientist for the state Department of Natural Resources and who has studied fire ecology.</p><p>But such an event is not only very rare, it also calls for a different kind of preparation and response in the Puget lowlands, he said.</p><p>Southern California has factors that make it far more conducive to frequent wildfires, including highly flammable chaparral (shrubland), steep ravines and high winds. Vashon's damp forests, on the other hand, are not nearly as flammable, and strong summertime winds are rare, Churchill said.</p><p>What's more, our forests are highly productive: When cleared, vegetation quickly fills in the gaps. \"In more moderate conditions, without winds, a closed canopy forest will have more moisture,\" he said, while grass \"can burn faster than a forest \u2014 it's flashy, like kindling.\"</p><p>In fact, studies have shown that hardwoods, such as alder, common in our forests, \"actually burn slower than other vegetation types and act as a wet blanket,\" Churchill said.</p><p>\"It's probably worth it to have a coordinated effort to assess our risk and educate people,\" he added. \"But managing our forests to be resistant to these extreme fires is a false hope.\"</p><p>Major wildfires happen when three factors come into play, as they did in Los Angeles earlier this month: Dry conditions, strong, dry winds from the east and an ignition during that window.</p><p>\"Wind is the major piece,\" Churchill said. \"If you have a wildland fire without the wind, it may move through the forest, but it won't be a catastrophic event.\"</p><p>Vashon rarely has strong winds from the east \u2014 they're generally moist winds from the south or cold winds from the north, said Reid Wolcott, warming coordination meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>A \"bomb cyclone\" \u2014 driven by high winds off the Cascades \u2014 is similar to the fierce Santa Ana winds Southern California is experiencing, Wolcott added. \"But the difference for us is that we typically get those in the winter, when we're also fairly wet. It's very dissimilar from California.\"</p><p>Climate change is a factor that has to be considered, both Churchill and Wolcott said. Summertime droughts are lasting longer in our region, creating a longer fire season; nights are not as cool or moist. \"But there's no evidence that climate change will increase east winds,\" Churchill said.</p><p>\"We're in a low-frequency fire zone,\" said Tom Dean, conservation director at the Vashon-Maury Island Land Trust. People who call for controlled burns to reduce the fuel load in the forest understory, he added, \"are conflating east side forests with west side forests. \u2026 We're a completely different fire regime.\"</p><p>Even so, many experts say we should be prepared for wildland fire.</p><p>A stand-replacing fire is a \"low-probability, high-consequence event,\" as one scientific article put it, \"akin to other natural hazards that westside communities face, such as earthquakes and tsunamis.\" When such fires occur, quick evacuation is the main focus. In September 2020, major stand-replacing fires occurred in Western Oregon during a period of east winds; 720,000 acres burned in 48 hours.</p><p>Far more common on Vashon are fires that start during calm weather and are easy to contain, Churchill said. But if not put out quickly and if winds pick up even modestly, such a fire could destroy homes and put people and animals in harm's way.</p><p>\"What we really need to be prepared for is the forest fire that gets started and spreads,\" said Rick Wallace, a long-time volunteer for VashonBePrepared. \"The danger zone for us is that first hour or so when a fire can get away.\"</p><p>To that end, agencies on Vashon and throughout the region are taking steps to prevent an ignition, especially before or during east wind events, as well as ensuring they have the resources to quickly contain a fire if one should start.</p><p>Vashon Island Fire &amp; Rescue has been working to enhance its crews' readiness for wildfire, said Ben Davidson, the department's deputy chief. The majority of its firefighters are now \"red-card certified,\" he said, meaning they've undergone 32 hours of additional training geared towards wildland firefighting.</p><p>The department has also improved its equipment. It now has \"progressive hose lay packs,\" Davidson said \u2014 hoses on backpacks that allow firefighters to enter the woods with the hose deploying behind them. \"That enables them to get a water source deep into a forest,\" Davidson explained.</p><p>The district has taken these measures \"not because we think we're a tinderbox,\" he said, but to prepare the island for what he called a much more likely scenario \u2014 \"smaller-scale wildland fires during very dry periods of summer.\"</p><p>Puget Sound Energy has also taken steps: It recently announced that it will preemptively shut off power if conditions suggest fire risk is high, a tool it calls \"Public Safety Power Shutoff.\"</p><p>Studies show that some of the most destructive fires, including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 84 people in Paradise, California, and the 2023 fire that killed 115 people on Maui, were likely triggered by power lines that snapped or transmission equipment that failed.</p><p>PSE has yet to use the tool, said Ryan Murphy, director of electric operations at PSE, and will do so only as a last resort.</p><p>The public utility recently hired Technosylva, a national company that specializes in wildfire science and risk reduction, to evaluate and rate risk throughout PSE's 25,000-mile distribution system.</p><p>PSE also has a meteorologist on staff, a wildfire expert and a team trained to monitor fire risk round the clock, all of whom will use weather forecasts combined with the fire risk tool created by Technosylva to let communities and emergency responders know when a power shut-off might be needed to preempt a natural disaster.</p><p>\"We've determined probability for every mile of infrastructure \u2026 so that we can ultimately make that very tough decision,\" Murphy said.</p><p>Just last week, Water District 19 commissioners also decided to take action. At their last meeting, the commissioners noted the alarming situation they read about in the Palisades, where firefighters hooked up their hoses to hydrants that sputtered and then failed, Seth Zuckerman, the commission's president, said.</p><p>The commission wants to ensure that District 19, the largest purveyor of water on Vashon, has access to enough water should the island face a large fire. So they decided to contact the King Conservation District (KCD), which offers a fire resilience assessment to agencies; last week, after their board meeting, Zuckerman requested such an assessment.</p><p>He expects KCD staff will look at both the vegetation surrounding District 19's facilities and the proximity of powerlines and help the district figure out the best proactive steps, including the kind of generator it would need to ensure continued operation.</p><p>\"We wouldn't want our systems to be so vulnerable to wildfire that they stopped delivering water in a crisis,\" he said.</p><p>Wallace, with VashonBePrepared, said he's encouraged by the island's response to a potential fire. PSE's cautionary blackouts \"are a fundamental part of preventing fire.\" VIFR, meanwhile, \"has made some important investments in their readiness for wildfire.\"</p><p>Individual action matters, too, he noted. Islanders can take several steps to protect their homes, from moving flammable objects at least 30 feet away from their houses to keeping their roofs, gutters, and decks free of leaves, he said.</p><p>Equally important, islanders should never use fireworks or burn outdoors during Vashon's hot, dry months, he said.</p><p>\"I would never say that we'll never have a bad fire on Vashon,\" he said. \"But what can we actually prevent or prepare for? The best answer is to not have that fire start in the first place.\"</p><p>Leslie Brown is a former editor of The Beachcomber.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Vashon-Maury Island Beachcomber</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VMISBC-news20250121PYH4686812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VMISBC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DY9-Y133-RWG4-J4YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475123</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Black Press Inc.

The Forest Fire Service issues annual reminders to the public to be cautious with outdoor fires during this time and provides guidance on reducing wildfire risk. The vast majority of wildfires in New Jersey are caused by humans.</p><p>New Jersey has had an early start to wildfire season this year. Since January 1, 2023, the Forest Fire Service has responded to 315 wildfires which have burned 919.75 acres. The largest of these fires was the Governors Branch Wildfire which sparked on March 7 in the Stafford Forge Wildlife Management Area in Little Egg Harbor, Ocean County. Smoke from the fire was spotted at 11:45 a.m. by the nearby Cedar Bridge Fire Tower and reached 100% containment that evening after burning 418 acres of forest. The area where the fire burned had previously been treated with prescribed fire in 2018 and, therefore, did not burn as intensely as it could have. The cause of the Governors Branch fire remains under investigation.</p><p>In addition to responding to wildfires and other emergencies, the Forest Fire Service has been conducting prescribed burns statewide to reduce the intensity of wildfires, protect property and improve native habitat for plants and animals. It considers a variety of prescribed burning factors in consultation with the Division of Air Quality and never conducts prescribed burning on a Red Flag Warning Day. To date this year, 20,750.41 acres of forest, grasslands and marsh have been treated with prescribed fire.</p><p>February was the 11th driest on record in the Garden State since recordkeeping started in 1895.</p><p>A lack of rain and snow is particularly of concern in the southern part of the state where forest fuels are most volatile, including the New Jersey pine plains which are comparable to the volatility of the chaparral fuels a shrubland plant community found in California and southern Oregon. The lack of snow in southern New Jersey this winter means ground fuels such as pine needles and leaves have not compacted, allowing fuels to rapidly dry out on breezy or windy days that are at high risk for wildfire.</p><p>January and February this year also marked the mildest two months of the winter season on record, with January the mildest and February the fifth mildest, according to New Jersey State Climatologist David Robinson. This is noteworthy because evaporation is greater during milder winters compared with more typically cold and wet winters, which may lead to more rapid drying of understory debris which act as fuel for wildfires across New Jersey.</p><p>In 2022, the Forest Fire Service responded to 1,175 wildfires which burned 12,664 acres including the 11,129.5-acre Mullica River Wildfire in Wharton State Forest, the largest wildfire in New Jersey since 2007. Additionally, New Jersey was in a drought watch for nearly five months, seeing the 4th driest summer on record. The drought watch lifted in December.</p><p>Wildfire Prevention</p><p>Most wildfires are preventable. Heres how to help reduce wildfire risk:</p><p>Dont discard cigarettes, matches or smoking materials on the ground.</p><p>Contact your nearest Forest Fire Service office for information on how to obtain a Campfire Permit.</p><p>Dont leave fires unattended. Douse them completely, until cold to the touch.</p><p>Keep matches and lighters away from children. Teach youth about fire safety. Children can learn about wildfire safety with Smokey Bears new mobile game Smokeys Scouts.</p><p>Protect your home and other structures from wildfire by creating defensible space.</p><p>Ensure fire trucks can access driveways.</p><p>Report suspicious vehicles and individuals to authorities.</p><p>Use wood stoves and fireplaces carefully, since both can emit embers that spark fires. Fully douse ashes with water before disposal.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service has several useful tools on its website to keep New Jersey residents informed, including the Fire Danger Dashboard and the Prescribed Fire Notifications Map.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service encourages New Jerseyans to stay informed about wildfire risk and weather conditions that may contribute to the spread of a wildfire, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. Everyone can do their part to help the Forest Fire Service protect life, property and natural resources.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125822534</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67XS-WTK1-JCBF-S2FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 3, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 With <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/wildfires\">wildfires</url> burning after its driest September and October ever, New Jersey will issue a drought warning, a step that could eventually lead to mandatory water restrictions if significant rain doesn't fall soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The state Department of Environmental Protection held an online hearing Tuesday on the conditions. But they would not answer questions, including whether any part of the state is in danger of running out of drinking water or adequate water to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/northeast-wildfires-new-york-jersey-california-bbf0ea8cdf56c6facaf7779c118a29d7\">fight fires</url>, which are burning in nearly a half-dozen locations. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from the department after the meeting.</p><p>About an hour after it concluded, the department announced a press briefing for Wednesday \u201cto discuss the state entering Drought Warning status as prolonged dry periods continue statewide.\u201d</p><p>The New Jersey Forest Fire Service says conditions in the state are the driest they have been in nearly 120 years.</p><p>State geologist Steven Domber said water levels are declining across New Jersey.</p><p>\u201cThey are well below long-term averages, and they're trending down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will continue to drop over the coming weeks unless we get significant rainfall.\u201d</p><p>He said about half the public water systems in New Jersey are experiencing close to normal demand for water, but 40% are seeing higher demand than usual.</p><p>It could take 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain to meaningfully improve conditions in New Jersey, officials said. But forecasts don't call for that.</p><p>The combination of higher than normal temperatures, severely diminished rainfall and strong demand for water is stressing water supplies, said David Robinson, the state climatologist. He said New Jersey received 0.02 inches (a half-millimeter) of rain in October, when 4.19 inches (10.64 cm) is normal.</p><p>So far in November, the state has gotten a quarter to a half-inch (1.27 cm) of rain. The statewide average for the month is 4 inches (10.16 cm).</p><p>Since August, the state received 2 inches (5.08 cm) of rain when it should have gotten a foot (0.3 meters), Robinson said.</p><p>\u201cA bleak picture is only worsening,\u201d he said.</p><p>The state was under a drought watch Tuesday morning, which includes restrictions on most outdoor fires and calls for voluntary conservation. The next step, which the state is considering, a drought warning, imposes additional requirements on water systems, and asks for even more voluntary water-saving actions. The final step would be declaration of a drought emergency, under which businesses and homes would face mandatory water restrictions.</p><p>Several leaders of public water systems urged New Jersey to go straight to a drought emergency. Tim Eustace, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, said the Wanaque Reservoir is at about 45% of capacity.</p><p>\u201cUsing drinking water to water lawns is kind of crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would really like to move to a drought emergency so we can stop people from watering their lawns.\u201d</p><p>New Jersey has been battling numerous wildfires in recent weeks, including at least five last week. The largest has burned nearly 5 1/2 square miles (14.24 square kilometers) on the New Jersey-New York border and led to the death of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-new-york-fires-2ecc0fa526dc9fe71870f7e6f9b0e5be\">New York parks worker</url>. That fire was 20% contained as of Tuesday morning.</p><p>Conditions are also dry in New York, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/new-york-drought-watch-dry-october-89b1ab499e9cc371b9abbc037c01256e\">issued a drought watch</url> last week. Mayor Eric Adams mayor urged residents to take shorter showers, fix dripping faucets and otherwise conserve water.</p><p>Just 0.01 inches (0.02 cm) of rain fell last month on the city\u2019s Central Park, where October normally brings about 4.4 inches (11.2 cm) of precipitation, National Weather Service records show. City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala said it was the driest October in over 150 years of records.</p><p>Jeff Tober, manager of Rancocas Creek Farm in the bone-dry New Jersey Pinelands, said his farm has gotten 0.6 inches (1.52 cm) of rain in the last 87 days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty brutal,\u201d he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Wayne Parry on X: <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/WayneParryAC\">@WayneParryAC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-77c8c43c65ea884608197e99573acd1b20241112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD8-CSG1-JC5B-G26C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><timeReceived>6:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

But coupled with that immediately, is also the intrigue of what comes next, and that is a drama, the curtain of which is about to rise.</p><p>SETH DOANE: John Allen is the editor of Crux, a news site specializing in the Catholic Church. He notes, in those meetings starting this morning, nearby Cardinals will soon be joined by those from around the world.</p><p>What happens in this meeting of cardinals?</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: The really important part of these meetings begin when Cardinals begin giving programmatic talks about where they believe the church stands and what the profile of the man is needed to carry it forward.</p><p>Now let`s be clear, these are not the Iowa Caucuses. Nobody is going to be standing up barnstorming on behalf of their preferred candidate, but this is as close to political sausage grinding as we are going to get in the process of electing the next Pope.</p><p>SETH DOANE: The politics behind selecting the next Pope are in stark contrast to what we saw just two days ago.</p><p>JOHN ALLEN: For the last 12 years, the world and this city have been blessed by the presence of a Pope who towered over this space as a voice for all those who are forgotten, all of those who were set aside, the marginalized and the down trodden.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>SETH DOANE: And John Allen also added that Pope Francis went out as he came in, being present and with the people. We know that the Pope`s body will be brought in a procession here to St. Peter`s Basilica behind us. That will happen tomorrow morning, and his body will lie in state until the funeral on Saturday.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: It is going to be quite a week here.</p><p>Seth, thank you so much.</p><p>And Roman Catholic Cardinals from all around the world are coming here, they`re on their way following the death of Pope Francis. They will attend his funeral. Then, under church law, the Cardinals, who are less than 80 years old, will choose his successor in that Sistine Chapel right behind me.</p><p>\"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor Maurice DuBois spoke with one of them, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York.</p><p>He was part of the Conclave that elected Pope Francis, 12 years ago.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN: I remember his first Sunday in Rome after he was Pope, and what did he speak about? He spoke about tenderness.</p><p>To hear the pope speak about tenderness, mercy, compassion, love. This -- this is what moved us about him.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: Is that his legacy?</p><p>CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN: Pope Francis, almost had like a radar for people who were left behind at the side of the road. I could see his eyes when he see the baby. I could see his eyes when he would see somebody who was maybe bent over and crippled at the side right over there.</p><p>I often think, Maurice, he was like just a darn good parish priest who knows his people, who stays in touch with them, and figures the best way I can convert souls is by touching hearts. Jesus did it. He did it.</p><p>MAURICE DUBOIS: What should people expect to see as they watch this unfold?</p><p>CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN: They`d see a lot of -- they`re going to see some mourning, they`re going to see some gratitude, they`re going to see some hope, and then they`re going to see people say, we need to get to work.</p><p>The Holy Spirit has already chosen the next Pope. Our job is to find out who it is.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Pope Francis did touch so many hearts, and that`s why bells tolled in Catholic Churches all around the world to honor the Holy Father yesterday, and the faithful have gathered here to remember his legacy, and that included worshipers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, its capital where Francis grew up as Jorge Mario Bergoglio.</p><p>You can remember he was actually the Archbishop of Buenos Aires before he came -- he became the first Latin American Pope. In France, parishioners mourned Frances during services at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.</p><p>Palestinian Catholics honored the pope in Gaza City. So did people in the Ukrainian city of Lviv.</p><p>So all over the world, people are mourning Pope Francis. The Pope, told us last year that he made nightly phone calls to Gaza`s Holy Family Catholic Parish in Gaza, something he continued to do right up until his death.</p><p>In the U.S., President Trump also ordered all of the flags to half-staff. We are expecting to have President Trump come here to that funeral on Saturday, as well as many other world leaders -- Vlad.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Norah, he really was the People`s Pope. As you know, there are more than one billion Roman Catholics. It`s one of the world`s largest religious denomination. For people outside of our Catholic faith, how would you describe the Pope`s role in historical terms and its lasting relevance today?</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Well, it`s a great question. You know, when the Pope speaks, the world listens. I mean, there is no other leader in the world that speaks to so many faithful. There, as you mentioned, more than a billion Catholics.</p><p>But he is more than just a religious leader. He is a spiritual and moral leader. Think about when he talks about climate change, that`s a big deal. When he talks about war and peace. He has called war an obscenity. That`s why you`ll see so many world leaders here.</p><p>And then, I think one other thing to know is he is also the Bishop of Rome. He is a head of state of this very small sovereign state called the Vatican. So he has those responsibilities, and that`s why he travels around the world -- Vlad.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Norah, beautiful. Thank you very much.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We are so glad to have you there, Norah. We`ll check back in with you later in the show and certainly tomorrow. Thank you.</p><p>We`re going to turn now to the worries on Wall Street over President Trump`s online attacks against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The President called him a major loser yesterday for not lowering interest rates, and investors are now concerned that Trump could even try to fire Powell.</p><p>The markets reacted negatively, as you might imagine, with all three major indexes falling about two-and-a-half percent yesterday. The Dow is actually headed for its worst April since 1932 that, of course, during the Great Depression.</p><p>We`re joined now by CBS News business analyst, Jill Schlesinger.</p><p>Jill, good morning to you.</p><p>Are these events connected? The President`s comments and the market tumbling?</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Absolutely.</p><p>We want to start off by stating a fact, and that is that the Federal Reserve is supposed to be an independent agency. It was created by Congress in 1913.</p><p>Why is that so important? Because we want the Federal Reserve, the nation`s Central Bank not to be pushed around by politicians, because politicians generally like low interest rates. That boosts the economy, people get jobs. The problem is sometimes when you drop interest rates too quickly, it can also foster inflation.</p><p>So what we now know is, around the world, people are looking at the Federal Reserve and saying, well, we know they`re in a tough situation, but on the other hand, we don`t want the president kind of pushing the Fed into a certain situation that might not be good for the economy long term.</p><p>So when we look at these two events, the President making these comments, saying he could fire the Fed, and then also listening to the Fed Chair saying, I`m going to push back against this. We have a real crisis of confidence.</p><p>Right now, there is a trade that is going on, not just selling stocks, but also selling the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar fell to its lowest level in three years. Usually when you have tariffs, the dollar rises. This tells us that the international community is selling America, and that is not good for any of us.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We don`t like that phrase, yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You make a point. Yes, I don`t either. You make a point of saying it`s supposed to be an independent organization. So is there any legitimacy to the complaints that Donald Trump is making? And does he actually have the authority to fire him?</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think the complaints are that the Federal Reserve should act now based on the tariffs that Trump put in place that could slow down economic growth, but those same tariffs could actually raise the inflation rate. So the Fed has said we are waiting for confirmation to see which one of those mandates.</p><p>So the Fed has two big jobs. They call it the Dual Mandate, try to have the economy grow enough to create jobs, but also to make sure inflation doesn`t bubble up, and if inflation starts to bubble up, the Fed might want to leave rates just where they are, but the Fed has said we want to hang until we get confirmation.</p><p>GAYLE KING: So can Donald Trump fire him?</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: So presumably he should not be able to. It`s for cause, and we know -- we don`t know, because this has never been done. And to be clear, if the Fed Chair is fired, he still goes back as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, and there are six other members of the Federal Reserve that could manage policy.</p><p>The way that this could get very ugly is that it`s destabilizing. This goes to the Supreme Court, and then we have a real crisis of confidence.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Wow.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Jill, before you go, the Trump administration announced the Education Department will start collection next month on student loans that are in default. That`s roughly, we`re talking about 5.3 million borrowers that are in default. What do people need to know?</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Okay, if you work for the Federal government, then your wages could be garnished if you`re in default. If you get a tax refund, that tax refund may be actually garnished by the federal government, and if you are getting a notice that says you are in default, there will be 30 days, and the government could actually garnish your wages.</p><p>To be clear, this is something that people who owe money need to pay attention to. Also, all of the people in default, we are now seeing reporting to credit agencies. We haven`t seen that before.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Wow.</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: So we now know that credit scores are dropping for these borrowers by somewhere around 130 points.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Geez.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You said it could get destabilizing. It sounds pretty destabilizing.</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: She is on fire morning though with money green.</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Yes, right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Thank you very much, Jill.</p><p>JILL SCHLESINGER: Sure.</p><p>GAYLE KING: President Trump says he still has confidence in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despite yet another scandal involving his use of Signal, that`s that private messaging platform. This time, it`s been revealed that he shared sensitive details of an upcoming military strike with his wife, his brother and his lawyer.</p><p>Ed O`Keefe is at the White House with the latest on this.</p><p>Ed, good morning to you.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Gayle, good to see you. Good morning.</p><p>The White House is strongly pushing back publicly on the idea that Hegseth is on the outs, but questions continue to mount about how much information was shared and with whom.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: President Trump is standing by his Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, amid fresh scrutiny of the Pentagon chief.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He is doing a great job.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: This time, it`s revelations the Secretary used his personal phone to share details about impending strikes in Yemen on a private text thread that included his wife, his brother and personal attorney.</p><p>The messages included details of when fighter jets were set to strike Houthi targets, the same information shared with top Cabinet secretaries and \"Atlantic\" Magazine editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg in a separate Signal chat group.</p><p>The Pentagon doesn`t deny the reports, but says no classified information was shared.</p><p>Monday, standing beside his children at the Annual White House Easter Egg Roll, Hegseth lashed out.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Department of Defense Secretary): See, this is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. It is not going to work with me, because we`re changing the Defense Department.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: The new pressure on Hegseth comes as three of his top aides were fired on Friday amid a leak investigation at the Defense Department, but the men claim the attacks against them are baseless writing they still \"... have not been told what exactly we were investigated for.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the President is defending Hegseth`s moves.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that`s what he`s doing. So, you don`t always have friends when you do that.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: And while the President claimed to reporters, everyone`s happy with Hegseth, at least one Republican Congressman, Don Bacon of Nebraska says, if the reports are true, \"This is unacceptable.

Recent research found 87 percent of rivers studied across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70 percent losing oxygen.</p><p>BRIAN SHEPPARD: What climate change does is it is starving oxygen out of the water. It`s raising the water temperature, and it`s killing off trout.</p><p>I don`t know that I`ll be doing this in 10 to 15 years from now.</p><p>DAVID SCHECHTER: Sheppard is part of a $750 million U.S. fly fishing industry, but he is finding it harder to make a living while he once took clients out all summer; today, the water temperature is frequently over the threshold for good fishing.</p><p>BRIAN SHEPPARD: Nowadays, we`re hitting that for two to three months out of the year, in the middle of summer.

Try to live up to it every day.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And you do. And you do.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Thank you. I feel the love on a Tuesday.</p><p>All right, let me talk to you folks about this possible security lapse. Have you seen this? The security lapse happened --</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Heard of it, yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: -- with the Homeland Security Secretary.</p><p>GAYLE KING: What?</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Kristi Noem -- yes. Get this. Her purse was stolen at a restaurant in Washington. It`s a very bizarre story.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Doesn`t she have a security detail.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: You think? Because, yes, you are assigned 24/7 protection from the Secret Service. So this agency, of course, the agency that Kristi Noem oversees.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: The Secret Service.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: What happened? What happened?</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So her purse was taken while the Secretary was eating out with her children and grandchildren on Sunday. About $3,000.00 in cash was stolen, plus credit cards and her DHS access badge. The two sources that we spoke to tell CBS News the purse was placed against Secretary Noem`s foot underneath her seat. Uh-oh. Never put your bag at your feet in the restaurant.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I do that all the time.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Do you?</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: In her defense, if you`re eating with children and grandchildren.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I mean, you can steal the shirt off my back, I wouldn`t know until somebody yells.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So, the question I had is, why she had three grand in the purse? Cash.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: You`ve got --</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: She says it was to pay for dinner, activities and Easter gifts.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: You do get a cash discount in a lot of places.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I don`t think that`s a question. To me, the question is, how does somebody steal her purse? I think that`s a very bold and brazen thing to do.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Totally.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Indeed.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I don`t know if the person knew who she was or not, but even if you don`t know, to steal somebody`s purse right there sitting next to them. So, they have it on videotape, I hear that they see somebody who slid their foot over and --</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And scooted the purse, so I don`t know how you do that.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, that`s very suspicious. That makes it seem like they might have recognized her and done it for reasons beyond just you want the money or the license or something.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: These are the burning questions America has, guys.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes. Well, I do.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Whatever her protection detail is, they are not the purse police. They`re protecting her, not the purse. So, yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That`s a good point. That`s a good point. We will find out. We`ll keep on that story.</p><p>Meanwhile, there`s a new rule for the Academy Awards that might lead more - - to more surprises on Oscar night. The Academy says, get this, members, you now have to watch all the nominated films in each category in order to vote in the final round of the Oscars. Didn`t you think that you already had to watch the movies before you were going to pass judgment on somebody`s work of art?</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Ugh. It had relied on the honor system in Hollywood.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, how are they going to confirm it now? I hate Hollywood.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, I was -- that`s what I was wondering, too. How do they know if they watched it?</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All right, let me break it down. In recent years, the anonymous Oscar ballot showed some members confessing that they actually did not get around to watching some very notable films, or they didn`t finish some of the longer movies.</p><p>Now, the Academy is actually going to track the movies that voters watch through a streaming app. In other words, you sign up like we do when we get screeners, and they can tell if you`ve watched it all the way through.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Or I could put on the streaming app and go take a bath.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, that`s true.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Oh.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I mean, then the thing is, if you don`t like the movie by halfway through --</p><p>GAYLE KING: You`re a very clean person, Vlad. But I`m just saying, how do they know? But at least it`s something.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That`s right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: At least it is something.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: At least, they are doing something.</p><p>All right, this last story is wild. So let me set the stage. There was an armed carjacking in Australia yesterday, when the carjacker crashed a vehicle, there were some Good Samaritans that were there who tried to help, not knowing that the carjacker was armed.</p><p>Now, reporters spoke to the two women, the Good Samaritans at the scene, whose mother was also one of those Good Samaritans. The catch, the women are identical twins. Check this out.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>WOMAN #1: One guy --</p><p>WOMAN #2: Guy.</p><p>WOMAN #1: He was up there with our mom.</p><p>WOMAN #2: Our mom.</p><p>WOMAN #1: And he -- he went up there.</p><p>WOMAN #2: And he -- he went up there</p><p>And he was coming back down towards us.</p><p>WOMAN #1: Towards us. And he goes --</p><p>WOMAN #2: And he goes, Run.</p><p>WOMAN #1: Run. He`s got a gun.</p><p>WOMAN #2: He`s got a gun. And, oh --</p><p>WOMAN #1: Our hearts started to pound.</p><p>WOMAN #2: Started to pound, and I said, well, Mom? Where`s mom?</p><p>WOMAN #1: Mom? Where`s mom? She goes, are you all right?</p><p>WOMAN #2: All right? Because he had all blood all over his face.</p><p>WOMAN #1: Blood all over his face, and he goes, I`ll shoot you.</p><p>WOMAN #2: I`ll shoot you.</p><p>WOMAN #1: She goes, hey, I`m here to help.</p><p>WOMAN #2: Hey, I`m here to help.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Wow.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Bridgette and Paula Powers, they say they were matching clothes every day. They say that they have brains that think alike at the same time. They admit that it is very weird. That`s them.</p><p>As for the carjacking, their mom -- they are safe.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Well, they`re in their 50s. That`s a little different.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Can you imagine what`s going on there?</p><p>GAYLE KING: But I think that`s nice.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: That is wild.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Remarkable. Humans, remarkable.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I want to interview them.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Human.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We`ll be right back. Vlad, that was great.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Ahead, Oprah reveals her latest Book Club selection from an author you will definitely recognize.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(LOCAL NEWS)</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>**********************************(08:00AM, EDT)**********************************</p><p>GAYLE KING: We welcome you back to CBS MORNINGS.</p><p>I`m Gayle King, that`s Tony Dokoupil. That`s Vlad Duthiers.</p><p>Coming up in this eight o`clock hour, first on CBS MORNINGS, one of our favorite things around here, Oprah is going to reveal her next Book Club pick. She`s here with the author, and that`s all we can say for now.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Admiral William McRaven, former Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces, is also in the building. We`ll talk about his new book and America`s changing role in the world under President Trump.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: We will also be joined by award-winning journalist, Suleika Jaouad. She says the power of journaling helped her survive hard times, and now she`s spreading that gift.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We have a jam packed eight o`clock hour.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: A lot of good conversations, but we`re going to begin in Rome with the Vatican announcing Pope Francis will be laid to rest after a funeral on Saturday, 10:00 A.M. Rome time.</p><p>These are the first images of the Pope in his casket. It will be brought to St. Peter`s Basilica tomorrow morning in what will begin a three-day period of public viewing. Mourners around the world include the people of his native land, Argentina, and, of course, the people of Rome locally there.</p><p>Chris Livesay has that part of the story.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: He may have been the Pope, but Francis was always more comfortable down here on the streets. That`s where we went with Father Enzo Fortunato.</p><p>FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO (Director of Communication for St. Peter`s Basilica in the Vatican): I think that the Holy Father is very linked with these people.</p><p>(FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: The Franciscan friar, was a close personal aide to Pope Francis. He was with him just hours before he died --</p><p>(PEOPLE speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: And he ran into him inside St. Peter`s Basilica on Saturday.</p><p>Did that surprise you when saw Pope Francis and --</p><p>FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO: Yes, surprised, very surprised. Pope Francis is a man of surprise.</p><p>(MAN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: It was not his first surprise appearance. A week-and-a-half ago, Francis was spotted wearing little more than a poncho with his head uncovered.</p><p>He was tender.</p><p>FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO: Tender, tender, no. Without the sign of the power.</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: But in the end, it was Francis who called the shots. Easter was a day too holy to miss.</p><p>(POPE FRANCIS speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: And Pope Francis, Father Enzo told me wanted to die with his boots on.</p><p>FATHER ENZO FORTUNATO: I said, Pope Francis, you love to consume your life between people, as Jesus.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CHRIS LIVESAY: There have been a lot of speculation that Pope Francis would want to retire for health reasons, but Father Enzo always insisted that this was a Pope who wanted to die on the battlefield, and when I saw him, just after Pope Francis died, he told me, \"Chris, remember what I told you?\" -- Tony.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes, he was working to the very end. He wanted to be out among the people. The doctors had their guidance, but he had his life`s work. Chris Livesay in Rome. Chris, thank you very much -- Gayle.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Hey, Tony. You know, I always say you meet the nicest people in the greenroom. I really mean it today, because look who is here?</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY (T.V. personality): A nice person.</p><p>GAYLE KING: A nice person on the couch.</p><p>Ahead, we will exclusively reveal her new Book Club selection, and what I`m excited about this is that most people in our audience will know who this person is and normally you don`t pick an author you know.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Normally, you don`t know who the author is, but you are definitely going to know this author and be really excited for her.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You want to give initials or no?</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: No. No initials.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Okay? No initials. She says no.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Okay. T.K.</p><p>GAYLE KING: She said it, I didn`t.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: T.K.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Time now to go to weather, 8:03.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Ahead, we`ll talk with best-selling author, Suleika Jaouad about her latest project, \"The Book of Alchemy\" and why her husband, Jon Batiste wrote about being gloriously awkward.</p><p>Plus, Admiral William McRaven knows all about crisis from his military career. We`ll talk to him about his new book and new challenges facing the world.</p><p>This is CBS MORNINGS.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>GAYLE KING: We`re here with the one and only Oprah. She`s revealing her newest Book Club pick, only on CBS MORNINGS, we love when this happens, it is a highly anticipated memoir. I just said to Vlad, Tony -- ready for this?</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Ready.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I`ve got -- yes, I am ready.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I am ready.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: And it`s called \"Matriarch\" by Tina Knowles.</p><p>(Cheers)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Now, what`s interesting to me about this is, when you started reading it, you didn`t read it thinking, this could be a Book Club pick.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Absolutely not. I read it thinking, oh, okay, Tina Knowles, celebrity, memoir, and then, like, 25 pages in, I went, \"This is really a good book.\"</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes. Then she called me and started reading me passages from the book. That`s right, it is Tina Knowles` life story in her own words.</p><p>She shares intimate details from her life and raising music superstars Beyonce and Solange, you know that of course.</p><p>She debated sharing private news about her health in this deeply personal book, and ultimately decided to include it to help others.</p><p>So we recently sat down with Tina Knowles last month at her home in Los Angeles, where she opened up about her decision to go public about this diagnosis. Here`s part of that conversation.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>TINA KNOWLES (\"Matriarch\" author): I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my left breast.</p><p>GAYLE KING: How hard is it to say that?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: I`m getting emotional, because it was like, you know, I`ve always tried to take care of myself, and I just -- it was -- I was in disbelief.</p><p>GAYLE KING: The American Cancer Society recommends a mammogram every one to two years for women over the age of 55, but Knowles missed hers during the COVID pandemic, and forgot to reschedule it until last year. That`s when doctors found two tumors. One was benign, the other had stage one cancer.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: It was stage one, which I thought was the earliest stage, and then when I told my sister, she said, no, actually, there`s a zero. So if I had gone for my mammogram, I would have got it at the zero stage.</p><p>Thank God it was still very small. It hadn`t spread. It was a very slow spreading cancer.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Knowles had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer from her left breast.</p><p>Take us to the day of the surgery. Your girls, all of them showed up for you.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: All of them showed up.</p><p>GAYLE KING: In the hospital before the surgery.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: In the hospital. Yes, they did.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And what did they do?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: I was nervous, and so they started just joking with me, and Solange pulls up this video of this young trans woman, and she`s saying, \"I`m very demure and intentional with my ...\" and we`re just laughing at it.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Keep it cute.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: I mean, we just kept -- keep it cute.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: And so she`s showing me this, and we just look at it.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Right before the surgery?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Right before the surgery. So I start laughing. I get out of my head and then they said -- I said, you know, I`m just so happy that y`all are here. And I thought about the song, \"Walk with Me,\" which they used to sing all the time.</p><p>And Michelle wasn`t there, but Solange filled in, Angie sung, and they sung, \"Walk with Me.\"</p><p>And it`s about God walking with you into something and protecting you, and that`s what they -- they sung that song, and I went in there feeling just like God has got me.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Last October, Knowles was honored with an award as one of \"Glamour\" Magazine`s Women of the Year, but she was almost unable to attend because of a serious complication after surgery that concerned her family.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: So I got this terrible infection and Beyonce just kept saying --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Don`t go.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: You know, Mama, you`re not yourself. So she was like, your health is more important. Don`t go. And I said, you know, this is so important to me because of what I just went through, because a lot of my life, I just refuse to be recognized. I would never take an award. I would never like want the attention to me, and this was my saying, I deserve this and I`m going to get there.</p><p>And so it was only, like maybe four weeks after.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I was there that night, and I walked in, I was sitting right next to you when you were speaking, the look on all their faces looking at you, the look on their faces, I`ll never forget it -- the pride, because, of course, they all knew it, we didn`t.</p><p>The pride -- and your speech that you gave that night about what they mean, you know, talking to them, of course they knew.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: And that`s what I wanted to say it, you know with them, I could get through anything. Nobody knew what I was talking about.</p><p>(Clip from \"Glamour\")</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: They have been right there by my side at the lowest points of my life, and they have cheered me on at the highest points of my life, making me feel like I could conquer anything.</p><p>KELLY ROWLAND (Singer): Because you can.</p><p>(Cheers)</p><p>(Applause)</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Because she can.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Yes, yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I mean, it just shows you -- what was interesting to me, well, I`ll talk about it after the break.</p><p>Oprah is sticking around. I`ve got something to say. Miss Tina will join us as well right after the break, she`s going to share why it was so important for her to tell her story at this particular time.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>GAYLE KING: Guess what? Oprah is still here. We wouldn`t let her leave. She just revealed, as you know, her latest Book Club selection.</p><p>\"Matriarch\" is the name of the book by the lovely Tina Knowles. It`s a very personal memoir detailing Tina`s life story from growing up in Texas during segregation to raising music superstars, that would be Beyonce and Solange, of course.</p><p>Tina, we are so glad to have you in the studio. I`ve been waiting, waiting to talk to -- for people to hear your story. But what was interesting to me reading the book, when I got to the part about the cancer, I called over, I said, you didn`t say that Tina had cancer. So when I read it, it was like being punched in the gut. You didn`t reveal that even when you`re talking to people.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Because any time anybody is going to read the book, I don`t want to tell you what`s in the book.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: I will tell you that when I first started reading the book, as we said earlier, I wasn`t reading it as a Book Club selection, but because it is such a strong and powerful story, and what you did is what I think is so hard to do when you`re writing a memoir, and that is to tell your story intimately, personally, but also make it universal, so that everybody else who is reading it feels the depth of your story and thinks about their own story.</p><p>And so I believe everybody who has a mother --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: And everybody who is a mother is going to love this story.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Because you`re the ultimate matriarch, but you make it universal for everybody.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Exactly.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Thank you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: What is it like for you, Tina, this day that it`s come out. Now people will hear about your news. They will hear about your life story. What is this day like for you?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: It`s -- you know, it`s a wonderful day. I mean, look what I`m starting off doing. You don`t get better than this, but I still have a little anxiety, you know, because you`re just putting it out into the world and you know, to be really scrutinized and turned over.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Because people will have something --</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Regurgitated. They will always --</p><p>GAYLE KING: They will always have something to say. But what I`m fascinated about this book is because your family is notoriously private. How you were able to write this book and what you decided to include. Did you talk to them about it first? Did you say this is what I`m thinking? What was that process?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: No, I didn`t. I just gave each of them their parts of the book. And of course, I started off with a thousand pages, so I had to take a lot of things out.</p><p>GAYLE KING: A thousand pages?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: A thousand pages.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Wow.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: And the publisher was like, nobody`s going to read a book that`s a thousand pages. You`ve got to take out 500 pages.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Especially Gayle King.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Right.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: That`s all she`d be saying is, do you realize it is a thousand pages?</p><p>GAYLE KING: Right. Hush, Oprah, hush. Yes.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: So, yes, and so I just put the things in there, and I tried really hard to tell the stories without telling other people`s stories and that is really hard.\\</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: You talk there about some of your anxiety, your nerves, about the book, all of it being out there. What are your hopes though? So how do you hope people receive it?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: I hope that people will, for one, be inspired by some of the stories, of the things that I`ve overcome and I also think -- I also hope that people will do their family trees and get into their legacy and their ancestors. And, you know, because I didn`t know my grandparents, so it was one of the reasons why I wanted to do this, is to leave that for my grandchildren that I want, my great grandchildren that I might not meet, and they`ll have a story in my words, and not someone else interpreting my story.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Invaluable.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Tina, one of the things I find fascinating is oftentimes, even if you`re close to your children, they may not know you. They may not know your back story.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, that`s so true, Vlad.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Right? You may have and there are a lot of people who don`t have close relationships.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: They certainly don`t know who you were as a young person.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Exactly, Oprah.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: One hundred percent so one of the most fascinating details in the book is you chronicle your decades` long relationship and your marriage to the father of Beyonce and Solange, Mathew Knowles, and I want to know if they knew that you had this on again off again relationship with him?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: They --</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Until they read the book.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Of course they did when they were older.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: but when they were younger, they knew -- you know, and there was a time that I separated, and, you know, they were devastated because they were very young and they never knew why you know, the real reasons why. And so it`s -- yes, it is a difficult thing until they`re older because you don`t want to put that on a kid. So --</p><p>GAYLE KING: You know, Tina and I did a podcast, as we do for the Oprah`s Book Club for Starbucks on YouTube.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Doesn`t that come out today?</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Yes, it`s --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Today.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: It is out right now on YouTube for Starbucks. And here`s the thing that I love so much, is that she knew early on, this is before people were sending their kids to therapy.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: She knew early on that the girls` relationship with each other needed to be balanced and talked about in a way that she didn`t feel capable of doing completely herself, so she started sending them both to therapy at a very young age so that they could appreciate each other`s talents.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: They were very young.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: And I think one of the things you do so beautifully in \"Matriarch\" is you balance each girl`s story.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: So it`s not just all about Beyonce.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Beyonce.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: You say Solange is the word artist. I mean --</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: She is art.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: She is art.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: But what I liked, too, was hearing about your own personal life as a little girl. You know, there`s some racism in the book. You know, your brother was attacked, your father almost died, and to hear that there was - - you were arrested. Teeny B was your nickname because apparently you had quite -- you were quite a mouthy little girl.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: I was a mouthy, yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: The biggest surprise to me is that her name was Beyonce.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: That`s where Beyonce`s --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Her last name.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: That your last name was Beyonce, and that`s where Beyonce`s name came from.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes. Yes. So I -- as a little kid, I -- you know, I say all the time that my parents had me at 44 and they were tired by then, so I just got to talk back and, you know, have my own opinions about things, and it really saved me.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Yes.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Because if I hadn`t had that mouth, I would have suffered greatly.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: As a 44-year-old parent, I can confirm.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Of four, okay.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Of four.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Of four. But I`m also interested in the commercial success of Destiny`s Child and your hand in guiding that, I mean that group to success and even the name. Could you talk about that part of the book?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes, I did, because I put their picture in my NIV Study Bible, and one day I opened it and it said \"Destiny\" and I was like, that`s the name.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s the name.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: And my ex-husband added \"Child\" to it because it was already a group by that time.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And the rest is history.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: And the rest is history.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You talk about a complicated relationship with your parent -- your mother in particular, but -- so when it came to you being a mother, you said motherhood was the best, important job of your life, and you wanted to get that right.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: What did you mean by that?</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Well, just because I was rebellious as a teenager, and just like I said, had a mouth on me, and sometimes my mouth got me in a lot of trouble.</p><p>You know, I talk about going to jail on a motorcycle, my mouth got me there. So with my kids, I said I`ve got to control myself. I have to be deliberate and intentional, and I`ve got to stop all the -- I mean, I`ve got to keep it together, because I have to give -- I just didn`t want to screw that up, because I screwed some stuff up, you know?</p><p>GAYLE KING: Don`t you think \"Matriarch,\" Oprah, is such a good title for this, because so many people wish you were their mother that they didn`t have.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I was going to say the same thing, Gayle.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes. Or they think of you --</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I was going to say, it`s not just the girls.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It is not just Destiny`s Child.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: The entire Bey-hive that sees you as a matriarch.</p><p>GAYLE KING: As a mother.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Well, and also, I think that what she does is pay such great tribute to her mother and her grandmother. And you see very early on in the beginning of the book, because her mother was this incredible seamstress, and Johnny and Johnny -- and Johnny`s role in your life, Johnny was -- you were so close to him.</p><p>And then the whole Renaissance thing is about Johnny.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Yes.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: And the fact that your mother was such a great seamstress, and now all of you all dress like your mother would have wanted you to dress.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Exactly.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And all of that is in the book. And guess what? Tina, we have a two-part interview with you tomorrow, because it wasn`t a thousand pages, but we tried to get every drop out of this book. It`s so good.</p><p>Thank you, Oprah.</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: Thank you.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Thank you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Thank you, Tina. Thank you.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Thank you.</p><p>TINA KNOWLES: Thank you.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: It really is a beautiful book.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I have to tell you this, \"Matriarch\" is on sale now wherever you like to buy your books. Tina`s going on a book tour. Will you go on the \"Cowboy Carter\" concert?</p><p>OPRAH WINFREY: I got my outfit, hun.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Check out the website to see what city she is coming to.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(LOCAL NEWS)</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>*************************************************************************** ** (08:30 AM, EDT)</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: All week, CBS MORNINGS Deals is taking over our \"Talk of the Table\" for our Spring Into Savings event.

Ahead, he`ll talk with us about his new book detailing crisis and how to deal with them, something the world has plenty of right now. Would you agree? The world has plenty of crises right now. He`s going to break it down for us, but first time for a check of your local weather.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Admiral William McRaven is more than a little bit familiar with complicated, difficult, even very dangerous situations. He, of course, served nearly 40 years as a Navy SEAL, commanding at every level.</p><p>The four-star Admiral`s final assignment, famously, was as Commander of all U.S. Special Operations Forces, and he was the individual who planned and oversaw the mission that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.</p><p>Well, now he`s a best-selling author, and his latest book is called \"Conquering Crisis: Ten Lessons to Learn Before You Need Them.\"</p><p>Admiral McRaven, good morning.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret) (\"Conquering Crisis\" author): Hi. Good to be with you all. Thanks.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: It`s a great book. I mean, just the basic insight that there`s a difference between leading day-to-day and leading in crisis, and I also like how the Apollo 13 mission, which NASA calls a successful failure, was the inspiration.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Right.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Tell me how.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Well I had an opportunity to meet Commander Jim Lovell -- Captain Jim Lovell, many years ago, and it kind of forced me to reflect on Apollo 13. And I was a young boy when Apollo 13 happened, and when you think about a crisis, and this is why crisis leadership is different than day-to-day leadership.</p><p>In a crisis leadership, your time is constrained, your resources are constrained. Lives can sometimes be on the line. Everybody is watching.</p><p>So you have to have a different tool set. You have to have different skills to be able to deal with the crisis. And Apollo 13 was the crisis of our day.</p><p>You think about 1970, the three astronauts go up, they have to move from the command module to the lunar module, and now you`ve got to address this crisis. And of course, Gene Kranz on the ground, did a marvelous job, along with the other engineers, and they got through the crisis because they followed certain approaches and processes.</p><p>And so again, crisis leadership is fundamentally different than day-to-day leadership.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like what you say too about first reports in a crisis are normally wrong. That`s how it happens here around breaking news. The first reports initially are normally wrong.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: So first, get your facts straight and then own up to your mistakes.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s what a lot of -- a lot of leaders don`t do.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: No, they really don`t.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): I mean --</p><p>GAYLE KING: They don`t.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): We learn in the military and it is the old Napoleon Bonaparte quote that \"First reports are always wrong.\" They`re not always wrong, but most of the time they are wrong.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): So you have to be very careful about making a declarative statement coming out and saying, in a lot of cases, we take it on the positive side. Well, we got him, this is great, and then you find out, well, maybe we didn`t get the right guy, or maybe things didn`t go quite as well as we needed to.</p><p>But when things don`t go well, to your point, Gayle, the leader, needs to stand in front of the shareholders, the people, the rank and file, and say, Look, things are not going well. We didn`t get this right. We made a mistake. Now here`s my plan to get out of the crisis and move forward.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: So Admiral, it`s great that Gayle mentions breaking news, because we do have some news that I want to ask you about. I want to get your thoughts on the multiple sources that have told CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has shared sensitive military plans on two separate occasions on a Signal group chat, one with a journalist inadvertently, and most recently, with members of his own family.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That was not inadvertent.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: That was not inadvertent.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: He actually shared those according to the reports. And I was struck by what you wrote on Page 74 of your book, the truth can be a powerful weapon in helping to resolve most crises. If the public or your stockholders or your bosses believe that this is an isolated incident, that you`re acting in good faith, they`re likely to give you some maneuvering space.</p><p>If, however, they believe you are misrepresenting the truth, or worse, outright lying, then they become suspicious and the questions will ensue. Break that down in the context of your book.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): I mean, the fact of the matter is, the end of the day, the truth always comes out.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): So as a leader, again, this is the hard part about being in a crisis. You have to face the crisis head on. You have to face it head on. You think of it as a fast moving forest fire. You want to be able to hit it head on. You want to be able to put maximum pressure against it, but you also have to stand up, and you have to face the allegations. And if you screwed up, the best thing to do as a leader is to say, hey, I messed up. And again, here`s what I`m going to do to get through it.</p><p>Now, in the case of Pete Hegseth --</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Should he resign?</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Well, again, that`s a decision for the President.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: If he was a young lieutenant under your command, what would you do?</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Well, you have to hold him accountable. So, I mean, accountability is an important part of being a leader in any level and Pete Hegseth has come out a lot of times and said, look, what he`s trying to do in the military is to hold people accountable. And I think that`s great, but as a leader, you also have to hold yourself accountable.</p><p>So if I were Hegseth, I`d do a couple of things. I would one, surround myself with people that understand, you know, the Pentagon, understand the Department of Defense a little better. Make sure you`ve got people that are prepared to speak truth to power. And I tell you, he`s got a great chairman in Gen. Dan Caine. I know Dan well. He`s going to do a fabulous job.</p><p>Number one, I liked C.Q. Brown, and I thought C.Q. Brown was an excellent officer, but he has been moved on, and now Dan is in that position. If I were Secretary Hegseth, I would rely on Dan Caine for his best military advice.</p><p>GAYLE KING: What happens when people don`t appear to hold themselves accountable and instead blame others?</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Yes, then, as you know, Gayle, it begins to spread like wildfire across the organization. If the organization thinks that you as the leader, are not going to hold yourself accountable, then, why should they hold themselves accountable? So it starts at the top. All great leadership and all great organizations begin at the top.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: In under 30 seconds, most people are not going to be dealing with NASA missions or --</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: -- you know, must succeed military operations. They`re just trying to run a family or a small business. How does your book help them?</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s true.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: You`ve got about 20 seconds left.</p><p>GAYLE KING: But it does.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): So what I want to tell you is whether you are the CEO of a global company or whether you are an individual, when you`re in a crisis, you have to face it head on.</p><p>I laugh with my students at U.T. and talk about the second law of thermodynamics. Basically, things deteriorate over time. So if you think it`s going to get better, it`s not. Deal with it head on. Deal with it head on personally; deal with it head on professionally and that will help you get through it.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: That`s right.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: Second law of thermodynamics.</p><p>GAYLE KING: But it is great. In your own book, you write about the mistakes you made.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And how you handled them at the time.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: The book is great.</p><p>GAYLE KING: It is so good.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: It really is. And you`re writing a children`s book.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): I am writing children`s book. \"Be a Hero with Skipper the Seal.\" It`s in conjunction with my daughter. We`ve had a lot of fun doing that.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: We`ll have you back for that, Admiral McRaven.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): Thanks.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Thank you very much.</p><p>ADMIRAL WILLIAM MCRAVEN (Ret): My pleasure.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: \"Conquering Crisis\" is on sale right now.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>(Clip from \"Life Interrupted\"/\"The New York Times\")</p><p>GAYLE KING: Journalist and author, Suleika Jaouad, six-part series \"Life Interrupted\" explored her leukemia diagnosis at just 22 years old. She says that journal writing helped save her life.</p><p>The journaling is a basis for her new book. It`s called \"The Book of Alchemy.\" I love that word, \"alchemy,\" inspired by a project in which she created a community of 100,000 writers guided by weekly prompts.</p><p>In the book, contributors like her husband, that would be musician, Jon Batiste; actor, Lena Dunham; and social activist, Gloria Steinem share words of inspiration, including new prompts to spur creativity.</p><p>Suleika Jaouad, we`re happy to say, joins us here in the studio. I love this book so much because I think it will be so helpful to so many. And we`ve been saying all morning that journaling, you said, saved your life.</p><p>At one point you write in the book, you became afraid of living, so you had to befriend your ghost. How did journaling save your life?</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD (\"The Book of Alchemy\" author): Thank you. So I was diagnosed with leukemia at 22 and when I emerged from that first bout of treatment, I was struggling to figure out who I was and what was meaningful to me?</p><p>And so for me, journaling is a creative practice that I do daily. It`s where I go to show up for myself, to take a breath in this chaotic world and to write my way back to myself.</p><p>And so it really does feel like an act of alchemy. You get to take the thing that pains you, that plagues you, and you get to transform it into something interesting and useful, and in the process of doing that and in facing my fears and asking myself the big questions, it always brings me what I need.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: What -- go ahead.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Go ahead.</p><p>VLADIMIR DUTHIERS: I was going to say, you know, the book has tons of contributors, people that I admire, including Lena Dunham, as Gayle said, Gloria Steinem and even your husband, Jon Batiste writes about meeting Beyonce and Jay-Z and he has -- he has a quote of how he acts sometimes, which is \"gloriously awkward.\" And I just thought that`s how I feel sometimes.</p><p>But you say that glorious awkwardness can inspire creativity, spark creativity -- how?</p><p>GAYLE KING: And that`s one of the prompts, write about glorious awkwardness.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: Yes, it is a very gloriously awkward encounter that he has with Queen Bey herself. But yes, you know, I don`t think that you need to be a writer or a musician to benefit from a creative practice. I believe creativity is a gift that we all have access to, that we all have with us from the time that we`re children, where we use our imaginations, where we play make believe, and as we get older, we tell ourselves we`re too busy or we`re not good at writing.</p><p>GAYLE KING: You give readers prompts like that was one, give me two other prompts that will prompt people to write about something.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: The Elizabeth Gilbert one is great, right?</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: Yes, so --</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: What does love want me to know, I think it was.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: Liz Gilbert has a beautiful prompt that I write to all the time, and it`s to write a letter from love.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: Letter.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: So, at the top of your journal, you say, \"Dear Love, what would you have me know today?\" And you answer that.</p><p>But you know, how many of us have bought a journal with the best of intentions of filling it up.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: You write a couple of pages, you drop off, then you have to get another journal.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: And so that one is ruined.</p><p>GAYLE KING: That`s so me, yes.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: And so I really wanted to write a book that could help offer people accountability and inspiration and guidance through these -- you know, I describe the book as a memoir in essays, but also through this chorus of voices that`s really made up of the most creative people I know.</p><p>And when I say creative, I don`t just mean you know, Jon, and Lena Dunham and Elizabeth Gilbert. Some of my very favorite essays and prompts in this book are from a prisoner on Death Row.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>SULEIKA JAOUAD: From a young mother on the verge of widowhood, and the last prompt I`ll share, which is one of my favorites, is from a two-time pediatric cancer survivor who was six years old when he wrote his prompt. And his prompt is a game he played in the hospital with his mom, called Inside Seeing and the prompt is very simple. You close your eyes and you allow whatever to come forth.</p><p>So for him, it was tinkly lights and sometimes monsters. I think for us as adults, when we do that, it`s really just an opportunity to close your eyes to see what comes up and then journal about it.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like you say giving fear of freedom makes it harder to live a life. You said you can`t live in fear. And for you, you said, you want to be the handler of your fear. You want to be the handler the fear, not be the handle.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: And in this book, you help others do exactly that. And it is different from keeping a diary, right? It`s a special practice, and this will help people do it.</p><p>Suleika Jaouad, thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Their unwavering commitment and readiness to face danger head-on is truly inspiring, and their courage is a true testament to the values they uphold.</p><p>On Firefighters' National Memorial Day, we honour the dedication and bravery of firefighters across Canada. This day serves as an opportunity to offer our thanks for their ongoing service, both at home and abroad. We extend our appreciation to their families, whose support is integral to their loved ones' heroism.</p><p>I would like to take this time to commemorate the fallen firefighters who have tragically lost their lives fighting fires in Canada including wildfires this season. Today, we remember and pay tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Their sacrifices exemplify the highest ideals of selflessness.</p><p>Climate change and the growing frequency of wildfires directly impacts the safety of people in Canada. Again this year, we have seen the destructive impacts of wildfires and how they have significantly affected communities in the west coast, particularly in Jasper, Alberta. The work of firefighters is crucial to Canada's initiatives to enhance climate change adaptation and bolster our resilience against the growing threat of wildfires. Additionally, I want to recognize the crucial work of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre in coordinating the Canadian response to international requests for assistance.</p><p>I encourage you all to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable service performed by firefighters across our nation, as well as their continuous devotion to public safety.</p><p>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I express our deepest gratitude to all firefighters, past and present, for their invaluable contributions towards the safety and well-being of people in Canada.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126715334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CX0-7DG1-DYTH-G3F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 6, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He emphasized that an important tool for promotion of sustainability of forests is forest certification, which nonetheless, presents numerous challenges notably for small-scale producers in developing countries. The Union Minister said India has embarked on its national forest certification scheme to address these challenges. He called on all participants to work together to create a sustainable future that is equitable, just, and resilient.</p><p>Minister of Forests, Languages and Technical Education, Government of Uttarakhand Shri Subodh Uniyal in his address today welcomed all distinguished delegates to Dev Bhoomi, the state of Uttarakhand. In his remarks he dwelled into the states initiatives and programmes and stated to minimize forest fire incidences, empowering communities living in proximity to forests and incentivizing them to work in tandem with the forest departments has been a strategy that has found success. He affirmed that Forest Certification is an equally important area, being a mechanism for forest monitoring, and is the focus within Global Forest Goals. He emphasized that all will benefit from the exchange at the Forum of traditional knowledge, technology innovation, and community engagement practices.</p><p>Director, UNFF, Ms. Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo said that issue of forest fires has been escalated as a global concern, and their detrimental impact on ecosystems, and communities makes action imperative and the second theme for the CLI being forest certification has been a long-standing topic for discussion and actionable solutions are now need of the hour. She highlighted the impact of forest fires on ecosystem are more profound now and mentioned about the challenges of numerous stakeholders and upcoming regulations that need attention. She stressed that the outcome of this CLI is very important and the success will lie in all our collective ability to identify areas for action and recommendations to UNFF 19.</p><p>The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India has taken the initiative for hosting a United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), from 26-28 October 2023, at Forest Research Institute (FRI) Dehradun. More than 80 delegates are participating from 40 countries and 20 International Organisations, both in person and online, are attending the programme, including Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO), along with delegates and organisations from India. The programme has adopted a hybrid, physical and online formats for enabling participation across the globe.</p><p>This Country Led Initiative (CLI) focuses on two thematic areas: forest fires/wildfires and best practices on its prevention and restoration in fire-affected areas, and forest certification and sustainable forest management.</p><p>Forest fires/wildfires profoundly impact biodiversity, ecosystem services, human well-being, livelihoods, and national economies. In recent years, forest fires/wildfires have increased in scale and duration. Accordingly, there is a need to enhance collaboration and action at local, regional and international level on its prevention, reduction of its impacts and restoration of impacted land.</p><p>Forest certification has received growing global attention in recent years. Between 2020 and 2021, the certified forest area increased by 27 million hectares, led mainly by Europe and Northern America. However, developing countries and marginal forest managers continue to face challenges with the certification process. The Forum aims to provide a platform to discuss these aspects and the aspect of aligning certification systems with trade rules.</p><p>The Forum is planned over two days of exchange on the thematic areas and will host sessions on how to live with fire in a warming world, policies needed for implementing integrated fire management, how to make best use of the newly developed Global Fire Management Hub, and Forest Certification and Sustainable Forest Management. The discussions will be followed by cultural programmes at the end of each day, and field trip to Rajaji National Park on the third day.</p><p>The Director-General, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change shared with the delegates the importance of CLI and deliberations in these meetings in enhancing international cooperation on global forestry related issues. He highlighted the issues that accompany these forest fires/wildfires and its negative impact on public health, economic activity and forest biodiversity. He also spoke about the current scenario in India where more than 62% of Indian states are prone to high-intensity forest fires and how India has significantly improved its forest fire monitoring systems and fire forecast models. He shared with the participants the country's proposed global collaboration i.e. Gandhinagar Implementation Roadmap and Gandhinagar Information Platform, that emanated from G20 deliberations, to tackle restoration of forest fire and mining degraded lands.</p><p>The forums meeting witnessed today varied panel discussions on forest fires, policies enhancing prevention of forest fires and on the global forest management hub. Various countries and International Organisations participated as panelists including New Zealand, Madagascar, Colombia, Morocco, India, Portugal, Malawi, Botswana, Russia, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain, FAO, UNEP, ITTO and IUFRO. Subsequently many other countries and organizations expressed their views and suggestions on prevention and effective management including the role of community participation.</p><p>The forum on Thursday, the 27th October, 2023 will cover a round of interaction on Forest Certification and Sustainable Forest Management with country presentations from South Africa, Russia and India.</p><p>The outcome of the Forum will be a summary by the Co-chairs on the discussions held, which will be submitted to the 19th session of UNFF for consideration. UNFF19 will be held in May 2024 at United Nations headquarters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126210782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GK-C9V1-JCBF-S362-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 26, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Anthony Pettinary with Citi Research and we're very pleased to have with us Weyerhauser and CEO, Devin Stockfish. This session is for citi clients only and disclosures have been made available at the corporate access desk. To ask a question, you can raise your hand or go to liveqna.com and enter code GPC25 to submit a question. Devin, I'm going to turn it over to you and maybe you can start with a short introduction to Weyerhauser and the portfolio and then we can jump into Q&amp;A.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Well, glad to be here. Thanks, Anthony. At really high-level, I think most folks are probably familiar with the story. We are one of the largest private owners of timberlands in North-America, perhaps the world. We have 10.4 million acres of timberlands in the United States. We manage another 14 million acres in Canada under long-term license agreements. We also have a real-estate, energy and natural Resources segment, which is really focused on looking across that portfolio and land base to make sure that we're maximizing the potential and returns from all of our acreage. We can dive into those specifics, if you'd like, that includes our Natural Climate Solutions business in that segment. And then lastly, we are one of the largest producers of wood products in North-America. We manufacture lumber, oriented strandboard, a variety of other engineered wood products as well as 19 distribution facilities across the US and Canada. We manage all of these businesses at-scale with industry-leading performance and it's all underneath a very tax-efficient REIT structure. So that's at the high-level. Maybe we'll keep it brief, Anthony, because I think there are probably lots of things to talk about today. Yeah. So maybe we can start-off and if you can give us maybe a current state-of-the lumber market and then we got two executive orders from President Trump over the weekend, one on lumber, the other on timber. Maybe we can start-off with lumber and maybe talk about where the market is and then the impact of that executive order? Yeah, sure. Well, there's a lot going on in the lumber market today and maybe I'll back up just a minute here to provide some context for what's going on in the market. So if you look at last year, it was a tough year in the lumber space. We saw repair and remodel demand down somewhere in the mid-single digits. We saw multifamily housing, construction down a fair bit. And so overall demand for lumber last year was down. And it was a pretty challenging environment for most of the lumber industry. What that resulted in over the course of the year was a pretty significant amount of mill closures across North-America. So if you think about the North American manufacturing base, Call-IT, 72 billion board feet of capacity, about 4 billion board feet of capacity came out-of-the market last year. That was a little bit more weighted toward the back-end of the year. And so as we head into 2025, regardless of whether you see any meaningful uptick in-demand, which we think we will and we can talk about that a little bit more, just the overall supply-demand dynamics in North-America will be more favorable for lumber this year just because there is 4 billion board feet less supply in the market.</p><p>So that's -- that's the backdrop. There's a lot going on with respect to the new administration, particularly around tariffs. And I want to just make sure everyone is clear, tariffs are distinct from lumber duties and both of these things do have some impacts on what's going on in the lumber market. The tariffs are the 25% tariff that the President put in-place here yesterday. And those impact all wood products coming into the United States. And so that includes lumber oriented strand board, engineered wood products. Just for context, about 25% of the lumber that is used in the US comes from Canada, about 30% of the OSB that is used in the US comes from Canada.</p><p>So there is a fairly material amount of wood that is flowing across the border into the US and the tariffs will impact all of that coming in. If you look at tariffs by itself, that's one component. Duties are another component and that is specific to lumber and that is a result of a longstanding dispute between the United States and Canada over how logs are priced in Canada. And so currently, there is a 14.5% duty that's separate from the tariffs that applies to lumber coming into the US that lumber duty is going to go up later this year in August, that should go up to 25% to 30%. And so those two things are different.</p><p>The tariffs are pursuant to the executive order from the President, the duties are pursuant to a trade case. So putting all of that together, there's been some turmoil in the market. We have seen lumber prices going up here recently. Now that would have happened anyway because as you get into the warmer months and out-of-the winter months, that's when the building activity really starts to pick-up. And so you'd see more demand as you head into the March-April time-frame anyhow, but we've also had that additional component of the tariffs in play as well. So it's been a dynamic market here recently, but we have seen lumber prices trending up recently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And to follow-up on that, and just to be clear, you've got a duty that in the summer is going to go to 25% to 30%. We're talking about a tariff of 25%. So it's possible, maybe probable that there'll be a 50% to 55% total import duty plus tariff on Canadian lumber this summer? Correct. Those two do stack on-top of each other, yes. So what actually happens or how do you see the market playing out? Does the Canadians kind of hold-on? Do you see capacity closures? Do you see your supply response in the south out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean, I think it's really a function largely of the demand environment, right? And so to the extent that the demand is there for lumber. There are only so many places that you can produce lumber and so that would presumably cause some increase in pricing to accommodate that tariff for the Canadian producers. If you see the demand environment wane and you see just not enough price support for those marginal producers on the cost curve, presumably they will at some point have to take some of that capacity out, so further impacting the overall supply-demand dynamic in North-America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>And you said earlier, you thought that there were some signs of improvement or hope for improvement in underlying demand. Can you talk a little bit about on the R&amp;R side and on the new-build side?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Yeah. So as we think about it, the primary drivers for our business are really residential construction and repair and remodel. We will look at last year, multifamily was down quite a bit, but single-family actually was reasonably good with 1 million housing starts, that's not a bad year in single-family. As we look out into 2025, our base-case is a very slight improvement year-over-year in single-family. And the components of what makes that up, I do think you're going to continue to see the large national builders continue to take market-share. They've shown a really strong ability to navigate this environment through offering different home sizes, amenity packages, buying down mortgages.</p><p>They've navigated this time period fairly successfully and I see that continuing to happen. You know, there's always the risk with interest rates that were to go meaningfully higher over the course of the year, obviously, that's a headwind. And I think there's still Some uncertainty in terms of how the tariffs will play into the overall affordability calculation. But that all being said, this country needs to build a lot of houses and I think the big national builders are inclined to keep churning them out as long as they can get a reasonable margin. And I think that will probably be the case for 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Great. And can you talk a little bit more about your lumber of your lumber footprint in terms of maybe your cost position in North-America where the assets are located, how you think you're positioned to meet the demand?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So when you think about -- and maybe I'll even just talk about our wood products manufacturing footprint in general, particularly relative to Canadian operations. So we have three lumber mills in Canada and that represents about 20% of our overall production. Of that Canadian production, a relatively small percentage of that comes into the US about 20% of the Canadian manufactured lumber within Weyerhauser's footprint comes into the US we send a fair bit to Japan and keep some locally in the domestic Canadian market. So obviously, that 20% that comes over the border is subject to tariffs and duties.</p><p>On the OSB side, we have two mills in Canada. The majority of that production does come into the US and so we'll have tariffs on that. Similarly, we have two engineered wood products mills in Canada. So there will be some pressure when you look at those individual mills, but the market as a whole is going to have to adjust to that. And our overall footprint is primarily in the US so we'll have to deal with that around the margins for our Canadian operations, but the majority are in the US and will not be subject to those tariffs. Great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And we talked about the lumber market. Can you give us a brief overview of OSB and how the exposures are a little bit different in your footprint there? Y</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Eah. So again, the majority of our assets are in the US on the OSB side. That market hasn't been quite as volatile as the lumber market here. Over the last few years, we've seen relatively strong OSB prices for the last several years, a little bit of a dip in the timeframe, which is not unusual just because seasonally there's less building going on during the cold months. But overall, we've got a very low-cost production manufacturing asset-base and that's true for OSB, but really across-the-board, we've been working for a number of years on our operational excellence initiatives and we've really positioned all of our manufacturers -- manufacturing businesses to be industry-leading from a margin standpoint.</p><p>So we sit in a good place on the cost curve really across all of our manufacturing operations. And rounding it out, engineered Wood products, can you talk about those -- those product offerings and you made an announcement of a large capacity project there? Yeah. I mean, we're really pleased with how well our Engineered Wood Products business is operating. Our Trust brand within the engineered Wood portfolio is a premium brand. We get premium pricing, very strong product offering. We have a variety of different products that we provide to the market, some of which LSL is more of a proprietary product, our Paralan product similarly and others, LVL is similar to products that others produce.</p><p>But overall, very strong product offering, good relationships with the builder. We're really pleased with the position that we have in the market, which is one of the reasons we had just announced a new mill that we're going to be building in Arkansas, a new timber strand facility and just a little background about timber strand. Most engineered wood products are made by gluing veneer together to make a variety of beams. And those are really good products. But veneer comes from bigger sawlogs, right? You need the bigger logs, they peel the veneer and that's what you use is the input. The thing that is really beneficial about timber strand is you can use lower-value logs to make that product. So think pulp logs, which have a much lower input cost</p><p>. And so you take the pulp logs, you generate these strands, which you glue together just at the right angles and you get the strength profile you need to sell a high-value beam but with a low input cost. And so that makes it one of our highest-margin products. It's very much in-demand, has a lot of different end uses all over the home in single-family, industrial applications, all the way through to mass timber applications. So a lot of optionality, high-margin product. We're building it in Arkansas, which is an area with A, a lot of timberlands that we own. So 80% of the wood that feeds into that mill is going to be from our timberlands, but it's also a geography that has not very good pulpwood demand.</p><p>There have been several pulp and paper mills that have closed down in that region. And so this is an opportunity for us to get that integration benefit of putting that mill in an area where we have a lot of timber, which will tension up the pulpwood market there. So you get sort of that double benefit, both the returns that you get on the mill, but also the benefit and uplift you get-in the Timberlands. So going to be a good project, $500 million investment, generate $100 million of EBITDA plus additional synergies on the Timberland side when it's up and running. So really pleased with that product and looking-forward to growing our EWP business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Great. Maybe switching gears to Timberlands. President Trump also had an executive order on timber. And I'm wondering if you could give us some context for that and if there's any potential impact direct or indirect to your business?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. If you sort of step-back, the good news story here for our industry is, I think if you go back 40 or 50 years, you probably have not seen a President talk more about lumber than we've seen in this administration. And so while that does carry some risk around the margin, I think the important thing is this administration appreciates the importance of protecting the forest and managing them in a way to prevent forest fire, et-cetera and also the importance of having a strong domestic lumber manufacturing environment. So I think there's some opportunity there and that's something that we're excited about.</p><p>In terms specifically of the executive order, there were two pieces of it. One was investigating essentially whether other countries beyond Canada are subsidizing their wood products manufacturing. And so that was one component. And the other component was looking into ways to facilitate more harvesting on federal forest. With respect to increasing harvest in the federal forest, there is a component of that would be beneficial for everyone in the sense that there is a lot of forest management at the federal level that needs to take place to keep the forest healthy.</p><p>So thinning, think clearing out underbrush to prevent forest fire, disease pest, that's good for everyone. The reality is, I don't know that it's practical in the near-term to meaningfully increase the amount of harvest in the federal forest just because, you know, one, there are still laws that people use to challenge harvest on the federal land, so think Endangered Species Act,, etc. Those are still in play. Additionally, I just think the mill environment has been created to manufacture a log that's a little smaller than typical logs on the federal forest. We typically harvest in the West, I Call-IT 40 to 45-year age class because that's when it hits financial maturity, whereas in the federal Forest, they've had -- they've had a pretty extensive period of not harvesting.</p><p>So those trees are just a little bigger and most mills aren't really designed to take a log of that diameter. So I think probably limited here in the near-term in terms of that component of the executive order to a degree yes so if you look at last year, most regions in the US that manufacture lumber were operating at a reduced operating rate just because of the price environment. As you see prices go up, my expectation is the US millset is going to operate at or they might even push extra hours, more shifts to ramp-up volume. So to a degree, there is some flex in the system to ramp-up production.</p><p>Over-time, if you think the demand is going to be there and these tariffs are going to stay-in place for an extended period, people can add capacity to the system. Now that takes a little time. You can't do that overnight. That would be over a series of years. But we do have -- we have the trees available, particularly in the US South to increase lumber production in the US if that is the policy of the US to do that you know, the cost of lumber specifically, and I don't have the all-in, all of the wood using in-house off the top of my head, but the percentage of the overall cost of a house just for the lumber is 1.5% 1.5%. So it's not -- it's not as impactful perhaps as some might have you believe. Now obviously, the engineered wood and the OSB is an addition to that. But there are a lot of other components within a house that are a bigger driver of the cost than the wood?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Devin, maybe to give a sense, if one were to build a greenfield lumber mill in the US South, how long would it take? How much would it cost just to get...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I mean, so generally speaking, you can probably get one built-in 18 to 24 months if you're really hustling and you can get all the permits and you don't have to deal with any wetland issues. That's generally speaking, kind of where you are now, you know, going back to the pandemic, that got extended a little bit just because the order files with everybody doing all these big capital investments, that got a little stretched out, but that is largely normalized at this point, so you can move it along a little bit more quickly. In terms of the cost, it sort of depends on how big of a mill you're talking about, but $180 million, $200 million is probably in the right ballpark for a medium-sized sawmill.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Got it. And we were talking about your Timberlands portfolio. For your 10.5 million acres, can you tell us about where those are located in the South Pacific Northwest and sort of some of the characteristics of those markets?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, sure. I mean, we really do have a unique portfolio. It would be nearly impossible to recreate that, both in terms of the scale, but also the quality since we've been working on this portfolio for 100 years. So 2.5 million acres are in the Pacific Northwest. For those of you that are familiar with Washington and Oregon. All of the lands that we have are on the west side of the Cascade Mountains. You get a lot more rain. These are really, really good growing regions in the Pacific Northwest, some of the best-in the world for growing trees. So we have a pretty significant component of our ownership that's in the Pacific Northwest. Really good for growing trees, really strong domestic grade markets as well as access to export markets in Japan, China, Korea, etc.</p><p>So that's a really important component. We have about 7 million acres of timberlands across the US South that kind of go from Texas all the way up the coast to Virginia. Really, the US South grows trees really fast. Those are Southern yellow pine trees that are used in a whole host of different construction applications, a really favorable regulatory environment, labor costs are more competitive in the South. So we're really good place to own Timberlands. We're growing an export program out-of-the South as well to supplement that customer-base. And then the remainder are timberlands up in the Northeast, little different type of timberlands there, more of a mix of different types of hardwoods. And so forestry is a little different there, lower input costs, but not quite as productive in terms of volume growth as some of the other regions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>. All right. And can you say a few words on log price trends in those regions and maybe what drives log prices in the South versus Pacific Northwest?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, sure. Well, one of the benefits of owning Timberlands in the Pacific Northwest is that it is a very tensioned constrained wood basket, meaning, generally speaking, if all of the mills are running full-out, there aren't enough logs to go-around. So what that means in practice for log prices is you see a much tighter correlation between lumber prices and log prices in the Northwest. So as you see lumber prices go up and we've seen this here just recently, Western Species lumber has been on a nice little run here. You see log prices following close behind that.</p><p>The US South in general is a different story. Coming out-of-the Great Recession, there were just a lot of sawmills that shut-down. And so there was a lot of build-in forest inventory over the last decade or so. And so in a lot of wood baskets, it's oversupplied. So you don't necessarily see that same correlation when lumber prices go up. The general price in the South, if you look at an average has been pretty stagnant for, Call-IT, 10 years plus. We are seeing signs of improvement in specific wood baskets. And generally, what happens is when you get a new sawmill and there has been a lot of new capacity coming into the South for that very reason.</p><p>It's got affordable logs to manufacture lumber. When you see a new mill come into a region, generally speaking, you can draw an 80-mile circle around that mill and you're going to see tensioning in that particular wood basket and you'll see some uplift in price. And so ultimately, what's going to happen over-time, and it has been slow going admittedly, as new mills continue to come into the region as we can grow export programs, that will wood basket by wood basket tension those markets and ultimately put upward pressure on pricing. But it doesn't move nearly as quickly as the West.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>A couple of follow-ups there. When you harvest logs in the South and Pacific Northwest, what percentage roughly of those logs are going to go to a warehouse or sawmill versus selling it to a competitor sawmill or putting it on a boat or...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Well, I'll answer that in two-ways. If you look at it from the Timberlands perspective, about 25% of our overall harvest will go into a warehouser mill. Now if you're looking at it from the lumber perspective, about 50% of the logs that we manufacture in our lumber manufacturing facilities come from warehouser land. So the piece that makes that you have to remember in the South, when you think about the harvest, about 50% of the harvest is going to go to manufacturing lumber and plywood and veneer and 50% is going to go into a pulp and paper end-use application. And we don't -- we got out-of-the pulp and paper business. So all of the pulpwood is going to go to a third-party manufacturer. So if you take that out-of-the equation, a little bit heavier mix in terms of grade will go into our internal mills.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Got it. And then the South, obviously a bigger geographic region than Pacific Northwest. Are you seeing any regional variations that are worth noting in terms of like coastal versus inland or states that are stronger than others or where you --</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, each individual geography has its own dynamics. The Eastern Seaboard has been stronger from a pricing standpoint for a number of years. Part of that is there are a lot of pulp and paper mills along the Eastern Seaboard. And oftentimes when they get jammed up for wood, they'll buy not just pulpwood, but ship and saw logs, which kind of raises the price of grade wood overall. And also when you think about being on the coast, instead of having a sourcing region that's 108 or 360 degrees, you only have 180. So that puts a little bit of log pricing pressure on the Eastern Seaboard.</p><p>In terms of other geographies, I would say Oklahoma in the areas that we are in, you've seen some good log price appreciation. There are spots in Arkansas, some sub-regions in Mississippi, a little bit in Northern Louisiana. I mean again, if you look at where the new mills are coming in, that's generally speaking where you're going to see things tensioning up from a log price standpoint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Got it. And so we've talked about the market for lumber and OSB and the market for logs. Can you talk about the market for the timberlands themselves in terms of dollar per-acre values or just the amount of transactions, kind of average price of transactions? Y</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Eah. Well, I mean, what we've seen here really over the last several years is pretty strong pricing for high-quality timber packages. That's been true really for years and it's equally true today. I think for the quality Timberland packages, you have all of the traditional buyers, the REITs, the TMOs, private -- private entities that have manufacturing. You're also seeing some new participants. So there's money coming in from Europe into the space, some Asian investments as well, some folks that are looking at timberlands for a climate play. So there have been some acquisitions here recently where they're looking to do carbon projects on the land base.</p><p>So it's pretty active. More people at the table, particularly for projects that go out to auction. So pretty strong demand. You can see that in the price per-acre trend that you've seen both in the West and in the South. Those continue to tick-up and have for a number of years. The one nuance, I would say that's a little different maybe versus the peak in the pandemic was lower-quality packages during the pandemic were getting bid up perhaps beyond what was reasonable. I think people have kind of gotten a little more rational around the lower-quality timber packages that have come to-market. But for the quality stuff, the prices are still very, very strong and lots of people at the table.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Great. And that really segues into natural Climate Solutions. Can you talk about -- you had the Investor Day where you laid out a target for Natural Climate Solutions. Can you talk about sort of what makes up that target and your progress there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Making good progress. So Natural Climate Solutions encompasses a bunch of sub-businesses. So it's things like conservation, mitigation banking, solar, wind, it captures our forest carbon business as well as carbon capture and storage. So a lot of things that fall under that umbrella. We really created This business back-in 2021. We came out with goals and a target to get to $100 million of EBITDA by the end of 2025. We saw a pretty meaningful jump last year, up to $84 million of EBITDA in that business and I think we're on-track to get to $100 million. I would say, looking back to where we thought we would get some of that revenue when we kick this off, the one area that is slower, I think than we had anticipated is the carbon capture and sequestration component. I absolutely think that's going to be a big business for us some day, but the timeline to get those projects through the permitting process has been painstakingly slow. And so still think it's a big opportunity, but today, it's not as big as we had originally planned. But that being said, we've seen some nice growth in mitigation banking. The conservation market has stayed strong and our renewables business continues to progress nicely. We've signed in the neighborhood of 70 agreements for solar projects. We've got our first operational project with two more in-construction. We've got seven operating wind sites. One more will be completed here shortly with a nice pipeline behind. And the beauty about those renewables projects is they just stack on-top of each other. So every new project you bring to fruition and completion, it's a revenue stream in the last 20 to 30 years and they stack on-top of each other. So that will just continue to grow over-time. Really pleased with the progress of our forest carbon business. So just real quick framework for what that is. When you have a parcel of land, typically how we would manage it is to maximize the financial return. So you have a certain number of trees per-acre, you have a certain harvest age that you target maximum financial return on that acre. If your goal was to create the most carbon on that acre, you can manage that differently, more trees per-acre, longest -- longer harvest rotation. That delta in how you manage it differently and the additional CO2 that, that captures over the time of a harvest rotation, you can sell as a carbon credit. And so all of these companies, financial institution, tech, oil and gas that are looking to offset greenhouse gas emissions by far the most cost-effective way to offset that is through these carbon offsets. We've spent a lot of time and energy building the credibility of these markets. I say we and that's the industry, but specifically, we Weyerhauser and I think we've made a lot of progress there. We've done the work to build the pipeline. This is going to be an inflection year in that market. We should see our sales in carbon go up 5x to 10x this year. So really pleased with the development of that. And I think we're on-track to not just get the $100 million this year, but continue to grow that over-time. And have you seen any impact on climate solutions from the new administration in terms of, I guess, Trump give with the tariffs, does he taketh away on the Climate Solutions. I mean it's going to be differential depending on which component of natural Climate Solutions you're talking about. The rhetoric has changed, no question about it. When I look across the portfolio, it's not going to have an impact on the carbon offset business. CCS has tax credits, renewables have tax credits. And so to the extent that those change, we'll have to navigate through that. But ultimately, longer-term story, if you're a heavily emitting facility, oil and gas, chemical, concrete, et-cetera, there's really no other viable solution other than carbon capture and storage over-time, which is why I think the people in that space are continuing to build-out the infrastructure. On the renewables business, yeah, there's no question that the rhetoric around renewables is different than under the prior administration. But ultimately, we have a need for power in the US the delta between demand and supply is going to gap out at some point. If you want to -- if you want to go out and buy and build a new gas turbine, I mean, you can't get that equipment until 2029, 2030. We've got a pretty significant need, particularly with all the data centers to generate a lot more electricity and renewables will have to be a part of that, notwithstanding some noise and some bumps in the road, the longer-term trajectory. I mean that is what it is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>Right. And just to be clear, on the solar and wind, when you engage in these projects, you're not committing any capital or</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>To date, we're just leasing the land. So the way it works, we will -- a solar developer will or wind developer will option a component of our land. They pay us an option fee while they assess the viability and while they're working through the process. If they go-forward with the project, we'll take the trees off the land. We get the money for that. They will put their capital to work, build the solar facility. It's usually a 30 to 40-year agreement after which they have to remove it and then presumably we can replant.</p><p>So what you're -- what you're really doing is you're giving up a harvest rotation for a solar rotation at a higher-value uplift</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>. Great. Great. Any questions on that? All right. Well, we're coming up on the shot clock. Devin, you're the largest private land owner in the US. You have, I think the largest lumber business in the US seems like a very good place to be right now. Is there anything you just maybe leave us with as we add?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Devin W. Stockfish:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. The only thing I would say is we've been doing the work for the last several years to build the foundation, getting the balance sheet in the right place, getting the cash return framework in the right place, getting to a position where we have industry-leading margins across all of our businesses. We've been putting the resources into growing our manufacturing base. We're going to start getting some tailwinds here at some point in the not-too-distant future. And I think you're really going to see that start flowing into the financial results. So we're excited about where we sit. There will be some bumps in the road, of course, but I think we're really well-positioned to start really turning the dial on some of the growth initiatives that we've been investing in over the last several years. So excited to see what comes this year and in the near-future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anthony Pettinari:</emphasis></p><p>All right.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fire is a primary disaster that destroys forest resources and the ecological environment, and has a serious negative impact on the safety of human life and property.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Key R &amp; D Projects in Hainan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan University; Beijing Natural Science Foundation. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"Predicting the probability of forest fires and drawing forest fire risk maps can provide a reference basis for forest fire control management in Hunan Province. This study selected 19 forest fire impact factors based on satellite monitoring hotspot data, meteorological data, topographic data, vegetation data, and social and human data from 2010-2018. It used random forest, support vector machine, and gradient boosting decision tree models to predict the probability of forest fires in Hunan Province and selected the RF algorithm to create a forest fire risk map of Hunan Province to quantify the potential forest fire risk. The results show that the RF algorithm performs best compared to the SVM and GBDT algorithms with 91.68% accuracy, 91.96% precision, 92.78% recall, 92.37% F1, and 97.2% AUC. The most important drivers of forest fires in Hunan Province are meteorology and vegetation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"There are obvious differences in the spatial distribution of seasonal forest fire risks in Hunan Province, and winter and spring are the seasons with high forest fire risks. The medium- and high-risk areas are mostly concentrated in the south of Hunan.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping Forest Fire Risk Zones Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Hunan Province, China.

Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds. The Mountain Fire prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 31 percent contained as of late Sunday, up from 26 percent the previous day. The fire's size remains around 32 square miles. </p><p>The cause is under investigation. Some people have been allowed to return to their homes, \"but road closures, evacuation warnings, and orders remain in effect in some areas,\" according to the Ventura County Fire Department. \"Certain areas are open to residents only. As you return home, please watch for hazards such as live power lines and debris.\" Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state parks employee who died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire in Sterling Forest, located in New York state's Greenwood Lake near the New Jersey line. \"Rip brother your shift is over job well done,\" a New York State forestry services post said. New Jersey's state forest fire service said Sunday that the blaze - dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire - was threatening 25 structures, including two New Jersey homes. It had grown to 4.7 square miles and was 10 percent contained as of Sunday night. In West Milford, New Jersey, a Veterans Day ceremony was postponed to later in the month because of the firefighting effort, said Rudy Hass, the local Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. commander. \"Many of those personnel currently engaged with the fires are veterans themselves, and right now we need to keep them in our thoughts as they spend many hours, day and night, doing all they can in order protect our great communities in that area,\" he posted online. Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey, due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. But there was progress on other fires. New Jersey officials reported 75 percent containment of a 175-acre fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered, as well as progress made on other fires burning in the state amid bone-dry conditions. In New Jersey, Ocean County prosecutors Saturday announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. The blaze was largely contained by the end of the week, officials said. They said that fire was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned hundreds of acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles in the city some 10 miles north of Boston. The Lynn Fire Department cited \"a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\" \"We have had over 400 acres of the woods that have burned so far. We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn't spread further,\" Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday. The Northeast has been experiencing prolonged dry conditions. In New Jersey, the state Department of Environmental Protection is planning a hearing Tuesday to review its water supply conditions. A major drought was declared in much of Massachusetts last week.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001931bd9d2dbafbb9bdda1440000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DM2-7HT1-DY7N-F1X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire\u2019s size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The cause is under investigation.\u201cThe fire continues to creep and smolder in steep rugged terrain. </p><p>Threats remain to critical infrastructure, highways, and communities,\u201d according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, better known as Cal Fire.Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state parks employee who died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire in Sterling Forest, located in New York state\u2019s Greenwood Lake near the New Jersey line.\u201cRip brother your shift is over job well done,\u201d a New York State forestry services post said.Jeremy Oldroyd, a forest ranger with New York state, said that Vasquez died \u201cassisting with fire line construction.\u201d\u201cWildland firefighting is a very dangerous profession, and we try to take as many precautions as we can mitigate some of the hazards that are out there in the wildland fire environment. But occasionally accidents do happen,\u201d he said.New Jersey\u2019s state forest fire service said Sunday that the blaze\u2014dubbed the Jennings Creek Wildfire\u2014was threatening 25 structures, including two New Jersey homes. It had grown to 4.7 square miles (12 square kilometers) and was 10% contained as of Sunday night.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91124974/canada-wildfires-trigger-us-air-quality-alerts\">Health advisories</url> were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease.But there was progress on other fires.New Jersey officials reported 75% containment of a 175-acre (70-hectare) fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered, as well as progress made on other fires burning in the state amid bone-dry conditions.In New Jersey, Ocean County prosecutors on Saturday announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday.They said that fire was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of \u201cincendiary or tracer ammunition\u201d was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday.In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves has burned hundreds of acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park extending across about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city some 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston.The Lynn Fire Department cited \u201ca dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years.\u201d\u201cWe have had over 400 acres of the woods that have burned so far. We believe we have the fire contained using the main fire roads. We will maintain a presence to ensure the fire doesn\u2019t spread further,\u201d Lynn Fire Chief Dan Sullivan said in a statement late Sunday.He said windy and dry conditions \u201ccertainly made it challenging\u201d even as he asked people to stay away from the burned-out areas. \u201cThere are far too many weakened trees, and we don\u2019t want the public to get injured,\u201d he added.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/11/AP24315687884811.jpg\">Link to image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FASCOM-91226241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FASCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD2-0PN1-JC1K-F42V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475434</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Mansueto Ventures, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fastcompany.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Impact</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Tamil Nadu, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The destruction of millions of acres of forest each year by forest fires is a global environmental crisis that has realworld consequences for people's livelihoods and the health of our planet. The ability to foresee the onset of such a natural disaster is, thus, of paramount importance in reducing this risk.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the Saveetha School of Engineering, \"There have been numerous proposed technologies and novel approaches for detecting and preventing forest fires. Integrating AI to automate fire prediction and detection is becoming increasingly common. To provide effective forest fire detection, people make use of several technological expansions, with the IoT for data collecting and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the forecast process. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key study technique that has been proven to be the best in enhancing the presentation of detecting fire threats in important locations by several researchers. Due to the importance of object detection in this investigation, EfficientDet was chosen for implementation. It is suggested that fire breakouts be detected using a Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (RLSTM-NN). Here, we propose a Cat Swarm Fractional Calculus Optimization (CSFCO) algorithm for deep learning that combines the best features of Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with fractional calculus for optimal training results (FC). Terms of the simulation results reveal that the suggested process outdoes the state-of-the-art approaches.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The suggested typical can identify the onset of a fire with a precision of 98.6% and an error rate of only 0.14%.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: An Iot Based Forest Fire Detection System Using Integration of Cat Swarm With Lstm Model.

Joseph Neguse, D-Colorado, issued the following news release on Oct. 30, 2024:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lafayette, CO -- Yesterday, U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse announced he secured $500,000 in Community Project Funding to Colorado State University (CSU) to advance their Multiuse UAS Airfield Project. This funding--secured by Congressman Neguse as part of a government funding package signed into law earlier this year--will support the renovation and improvement of Christman Airfield, which plays a key role in emergency firefighting operations across the Front Range and is paving the way in drone training and research for the Rocky Mountain West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Colorado Congressman was joined by CSU President Amy Parsons, Drone Center Director Christopher Robertson, and a wide array of university faculty and students--highlighting the critical role of federal support in advancing this initiative. The event featured a ceremonial check presentation and allowed CSU researchers the opportunity to elaborate on the development of new aircraft and UAS technologies.</p><p>\"CSU stands at the forefront of innovation and technology in Colorado, and I'm incredibly proud to have secured $500,000 in Federal funding to help renovate and improve the Christman Airfield,\" said Assistant Leader Joe Neguse. \"After the recent Alexander Mountain and Stone Canyon Fires, our community understands the critical need to strengthen aerial firefighting and emergency management capabilities--and this investment directly addresses that need. Together, we're taking meaningful steps to better protect Coloradans from the increasing threat of wildfires.\"</p><p>\"We're grateful to Congressman Neguse for his efforts to secure this funding for several community-based projects in Larimer County. Christman Airfield at CSU plays a critical role in wildfire mitigation, and is used for everything from response to natural disasters to law enforcement to search and rescue. It's also foundational to our drone education at CSU, and we're appreciative for the opportunity to invest in this multi-use resource,\" said Amy Parsons, Colorado State University President.</p><p>\"Colorado State University's Christman Field is a highly versatile UAV research, education, and flight training facility, located northwest of Fort Collins at the base of the foothills. When it's not being utilized to train the next generation of aviators, the airfield also serves as an essential emergency operations center and staging ground for aerial firefighting efforts,\" said Adam Smith, Associate Director, Colorado State University Drone Center. \"As the third-longest continuously operating airfield in Colorado, the facilities and runway at Christman Field are beginning to show signs of age. This grant funding provides a crucial opportunity to revitalize the airfield, enabling expanded aerial firefighting operations. With these upgrades, Christman Field will remain a vital asset for Colorado's emergency management professionals, helping to safeguard our natural resources and mountain communities.\"</p><p>Additional Background on CSU Multiuse UAS Airfield Project:</p><p>As mentioned, the $500,000 federal investment will go toward the renovation and improvement of the Christman Airfield, which is utilized for aviation research and training for wildfire fighting. The renewed facility provides an updated location for aerial firefighting and emergency management during forest fire operations, supporting the protection of Colorado's natural areas as well as properties in the forested areas of the state.</p><p>Neguse secured a total of $11 million in Fiscal Year 2024 Community Project Funding for 14 projects that directly benefit cities and towns across Colorado's 2nd Congressional District.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/assistant-leader-neguse-secures-500000-award-csus-christman-airfield-enhanced\">https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/assistant-leader-neguse-secures-500000-award-csus-christman-airfield-enhanced</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8903139 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8903139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D9N-K021-JC11-13GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><timeReceived>7:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 31, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But occasionally accidents do happen,\" said Jeremy Oldroyd, forest ranger, New York State Department of Environmental Protection, adding that Vasquez died \"assisting with fire line construction.\" </p><p>The fires in New York and New Jersey come as firefighters are also battling a wildfire in California. </p><p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's Forest Fire Service reported the sprawling blaze had spread to 3.9 square miles near the border in Passaic County's West Milford and Orange County, New York. Officials said Sunday the blaze, dubbed the Jennings Creek wildfire, was now threatening 14 Greenwood Lake structures as well as two New Jersey homes and eight historic buildings in that state's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District. Officials said Saturday afternoon that they did not believe evacutions would be necessary in either state. </p><p>Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires. People were urged to limit strenuous outdoor physical activity if possible; those especially sensitive included the very young and very old and people with ailments such as asthma and heart disease. </p><p>New Jersey officials, meanwhile, reported 75 percent containment of a 175-acre (70-hectare) fire in the Pompton Lakes area of Passaic County that was threatening 55 homes, although no evacuations had been ordered. </p><p>Progress was also reported on fires in the Bethany Run area on the border of Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships; a blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County; and the Pheasant Run wildfire in the Glassboro wildlife protection area of Gloucester County. </p><p>Prosecutors in Ocean County on late Saturday afternoon announced arson and firearms charges in connection with a 350-acre (142-hectare) Jackson Township fire that started Wednesday. They said it was sparked by magnesium shards from a shotgun round on the berm of a shooting range. Officials said firing that kind of \"incendiary or tracer ammunition\" was barred in the state. The majority of the blaze has been contained, officials reported Friday. </p><p>In Massachusetts, one wildfire among several fueled by powerful wind gusts and dry leaves burned more than 200 acres in the Lynn Woods Reservation, a municipal park that comprises about 3.4 square miles (8.8 square kilometers) in the city 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Boston.

MORRISTOWN, N.J. ? A parks employee was killed battling blazes that stretched from New Jersey into New York over the weekend as historic drought conditions intensified a stranglehold across the Northeast, fueling wildfires and threatening lives and homes. New York City has been enveloped in hazy skies from wildfires for days, and an air quality alert was issued for the city and nearby areas of New York state and New Jersey into Monday. The city has not been immune to the wildfires, either - multiple acres burned across Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Highbridge Park in the Bronx over the weekend. \"Every New Yorker needs to understand that we now live in a time of extreme weather. Climate change is real - it's here,\" New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol told News12. \"Generally, when you think about climate change, you think of floods, you think about rising sea levels. But the fact is, it manifests itself in a lot of different ways.\" The Northeast hasn't seen a \"thorough soaking\" since late September, according to AccuWeather. The dry conditions have increased the risk of wildfires, dried up streams, and brought reservoirs to dangerously low levels, AccuWeather warned. In New Jersey, the West Milford wildfire crossed into Orange County, New York, spreading to 2,500 acres of wooded properties with 0% containment, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said Sunday. Roads were closed and more than two dozen homes, businesses, and other structures were imperiled. Brush fire erupts in Brooklyn's iconic Prospect Park amid prolonged drought 'Tragic line-of-duty loss of one of their team members' New York State Police said state parks employee Dariel Vasquez, 18, was killed Saturday as he helped battle the fire. Officials said a tree fell on Vasquez while he was clearing trees and brush. The New Jersey wildfire agency extended \"condolences to our counterparts at the NY State Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation Department following the tragic line-of-duty loss of one of their team members.\" Orange County Emergency Services posted a note on social media confirming \"the passing of a dedicated service member we lost today.\" Last month was the second driest October, on record, for the lower 48 states combined. The only time October was drier was more than 70 years ago. Parts of the Northeast could get some rain late Sunday into Monday, but the drought is so deep and severe the rains will have minimal long-term impact. As quickly as firefighters have doused the flames across the region, more fires have sprung up. The New Jersey fire danger dashboard, which ranks fire risk in each county from low to extreme, showed the entire state under extreme conditions. New Jersey and Delaware are coming off their driest Octobers on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Drought, fire warnings declared in the Northeast Massachusetts and Connecticut are among other states where drought and fire warnings have been issued. The National Weather Service in Boston warned that a Red Flag Warning was in place Sunday. Fires that start will spread quickly given extremely dry conditions and gusty southwest winds, the warning said. Connecticut declared a drought advisory and warned that water supplies could become a problem. Martin Heft, chairman of the Connecticut Interagency Drought Workgroup, said his state has had the driest two-month period since recordkeeping began in 1905. \"The lack of rain over the past two months has caused exceptionally dry conditions across Connecticut, resulting in numerous wildfires and reduced groundwater levels and streamflows,\"\u00a0Gov. Ned Lamont said. \"We want to encourage everyone right now to be mindful of their water consumption and take some simple, sensible steps to stretch water supplies.\" Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas (This story was updated to add new information.)</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5979784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD0-KFR1-DY7P-T4GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Central Florida Future: University of Central Florida</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 10, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Orlando</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>FL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Several fires in the Los Angeles area destroyed or damaged more than 16,000 homes and buildings. Twenty-nine people died as a result of the blazes. The two largest fires, thePalisadesandEaton, were both more than 98% contained as of Friday, according to theCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some estimates put the final damage tally atupward of $300 billion. Prior to the Los Angeles fires, the 2018 Camp fire was the state's costliest at more than $30 billion. Hawaii'sMaui wildfiresin 2023 led to $5.6 billion in damage.</p><p>\"Banks, financial institutions and insurers all have significant financial risk, and the fires in LA are just the most recent example,\" said Steven Rothstein, managing director of the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, noting it may potentially rank as the most expensive extreme event in U.S. history. \"To put it in context, in the 1980s, NOAA said our country had a $1 billion event - fire, flood, tornado - every three months; now we're getting them every week and a half.\"</p><p>Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with capital market leaders, has produced several studies on the effects of climate change on the banking industry. The group advocates for sustainability in capital markets.</p><p>\"That extreme weather has an enormous impact. For a bank, it could affect their customers, it could affect their suppliers, their customers' suppliers,\" Rothstein said. \"As we all learned during COVID, the supply chain is very intertwined, and an impact in one place can impact someplace else. We believe that there needs to be more awareness of these risks and steps need to be taken.\"The issue of climate change</p><p>Analyses of the January fires by theUniversity of California, Los Angelesand World Weather Attribution found evidence indicating climate change played a role in the fires' intensity: hotter temperatures and a drier atmosphere in combination with an increase in heat-trapping gasses from fossil fuels created the conditions for worse fires. The WWA study, which analyzed theCanadian Forest Fire Weather Index, found climate change created conditions that made a wildfire 35% more likely to occur.</p><p>\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Clair Barnes of the Imperial College London, the WWA study's lead author. \"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"</p><p>Concern for the effect climate change will have on the financial sector has existed for years. A 2021global bank risk surveyby Ernst &amp; Young pinpointed climate change as the top concern: 91% of chief risk officers surveyed said it was their \"most important emerging risk\" and 96% said it was the No. 1 concern for their board of directors.</p><p>The Federal Reserve last May released theresults of a pilot studyconducted over the course ofseveral monthsin 2023 that sought to understand how lenders would manage the risks caused by the environmental changes and adjust policies as a result. Participants included Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.</p><p>It found that the largest banks could see an increase in loan defaults caused by climate change and the decarbonization of the economy. A few months earlier, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of Currencyissued guidancefor banks with more than $100 billion in assets to manage climate risks.</p><p>President Donald Trump has already begun to unwind many of the climate efforts implemented under the Biden administration and set the tone for banks to follow suit. Earlier this month the Fed's Board of Governors voted toleave the Networkof Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System; theFDIC followed suitdays later. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase all recentlyleft the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, aU.N. groupformed in 2021 to encourage the private sector to align with the goals of the Paris Climate Accords, a pact the previous Trump administration backed out of in 2017. Biden rejoined in 2021 and Trump once again left upon taking office.How should banks respond?</p><p>Risk management is the first place to start. Ceres' Rothstein said he recommends banks look at their customers sector by sector to determine exposure.</p><p>\"The biggest risk is not whether the bank branch will survive. That's a very small financial risk in the context,\" he said. \"The fundamental question is, are they asking their customers about the risks that they have? What are their customers doing to prepare?\"</p><p>Laurent Birade, banking industry practice lead at Moody's, agreed, noting the recent fires emphasize the \"urgent need for financial institutions to prioritize climate risk management.\"</p><p>\"Similar to the impact of Hurricane Milton and Helene last year, these fires are likely to cause additional financial strain in the insurance and reinsurance sectors, leading to increased reinsurance rates,\" Birade said. \"Banks with significant exposure to impacted sectors in their loan portfolios must understand, identify, measure and manage their climate risk exposure through scenario analysis to ensure more resilient and sustainable financial operations.\"</p><p>Birade said there is additional risk stemming from the potential forinsurance companies to withdrawfrom high-risk markets, further straining banks' portfolio risks.</p><p>\"Banks should proactively assess and mitigate this impact by diversifying their portfolios and engaging in strategic risk transfer mechanisms,\" he said.</p><p>Rothstein said it's easier for larger banks to diversify their risks than small and medium-sized institutions. He said there have been cases where weather events have caused smaller community and regional banks to close completely.</p><p>\"Considering that the overwhelming majority of banks are small and medium-sized, many of them are even more at risk because they're more concentrated,\" Rothstein said. \"Bank of America - they have a very diversified loan portfolio, so God forbid, if there's a fire in one city or a flood, it's awful, but it's not going to affect them financially in the big picture \" But if you're the Bank of Los Angeles, you could have a very large percentage of your loan portfolio affected.\"</p><p>Chris Stanley, another banking industry practice lead at Moody's, said banks need to consider the multifaceted nature of the risk that climate disasters pose.</p><p>\"When confronting catastrophes like the LA wildfires, understanding exposure, supporting customers, and positioning credit-loss reserves become critical challenges for bankers,\" Stanley said.</p><p>Dan Saccardi, program director for the Ceres Company Network, a group of 50 major corporations that work with Ceres to implement sustainable practices, said the organization has conducted studies looking at both the physical and transition risk that climate change poses to banks. It found banks are beginning to measure and understand risks but they are still underappreciated.</p><p>\"Over time,they could grow to as much as 10% of banks' loan portfolios, if they're not properly addressed,\" Saccardi said. \"And while the major U.S. global banks can certainly absorb that, and also are much more diversified, some of the smaller subregional banks or community banks are highly invested within specific geographic regions, such that they could have very significant portions of their residential and commercial loan portfolios impacted by an event like the wildfires we've just seen or the flooding we saw in North Carolina in the fall of last year.\"Looking forward</p><p>Saccardi said while there is much to be done to hedge against climate change, there are many opportunities as well.</p><p>Understanding the risks posed to certain sectors and clients, banks have an opportunity to engage with them on a products and services level, he said. Financial institutions can offer resilience and mitigation-focused lending to clients to ease risks, and there's also revenue-generating product and service opportunities for banks to help customers finance plans to fortify their physical infrastructure.</p><p>Advances in analytics and AI will ease the burden by both assisting with risk management and helping financial institutions to identify and aid their customers most in need, Stanley predicted. \"Banks will use these tools to more rapidly and confidently support their communities in the aftermath of this tragedy.\"</p><p>Birade said banks should focus on strengthening their business continuity plans \"to ensure operational resilience in the face of these types of climate-related disruptions.\"</p><p>\"Physical climate risk management is becoming a strategic necessity for banks aiming to navigate the financial challenges posed by an increasingly volatile climate,\" he said.</p><p>Jay Ribakove is a principal at Convective Capital, a group dedicated to investing in entrepreneurs developing technology to prevent and address severe wildfires. He said there is opportunity for banks to help the insurance market minimize risk and price risk appropriately.</p><p>Convective Capital invests in companies offering solutions to address wildfires when they do break out and to mitigate risk. The options available, Ribakove said, depend on what consumers are trying to protect.</p><p>For homeowners and businesses, there are solutions including home hardening and introducing defensible space around the property. If a fire does break out, there are companies offering technologies for early detection to prevent fires from becoming more extreme.</p><p>\"Even within the prevention and suppression landscape, we need numerous tools because the problems are very different. Fighting a traditional wildfire in a remote area is very different than an urban configuration like what we saw in Los Angeles,\" Ribakove said. \"We're seeing a lot of new investor interest in this space, and that means we have a lot of work to do supporting the companies that we've already invested in.\"</p><p>These new ventures to address the growing global climate shift also need to be financially backed. Rothstein said banks can benefit from the investments.</p><p>\"Last year, the world spent around $2.2 trillion on emerging and new technologies, renewables, and a variety of other things - that's grown dramatically over the last few years, and it's projected to grow to $4 to $5 trillion a year - and all of that needs to be banked,\" Rothstein said. \"It's a big business opportunity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000194bd6bd2e9a3ddfd7f2c2e00001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1B-BVN3-S3T8-F519-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>americanbanker.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40529\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 1</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/la-wildfires-put-climate-risk-management-in-focus-for-banks\">https://www.americanbanker.com/news/la-wildfires-put-climate-risk-management-in-focus-for-banks</url><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 31, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

By mid-2025, Rio Tinto expects to finalize its Arcadium Lithium <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/ALTM\">(ALTM)</url> acquisition, which will make it the world's third-largest lithium producer - a huge win given lithium's importance in electric vehicles and renewable energy. Analysts are optimistic too, giving the stock a consensus \"Buy\" rating, showing confidence in its future.\u00a0</p><p>Let's dive into what makes Rio Tinto such a compelling choice for both income- and growth-focused investors in 2025.</p><h>Rio Tinto's Financial Performance and Valuation</h><p>Rio Tinto <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/RIO\">(RIO)</url> is a global mining giant with operations across six continents, producing essential materials like iron ore, copper <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/HGH25\">(HGH25)</url>, aluminum <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/ALH25\">(ALH25)</url>, and critical minerals. These resources are the backbone of modern industries and play a big role in supporting the shift to green energy.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The company\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dividend.com/stocks/materials/iron-steel/steel-raw-material-suppliers/rio-rio-tinto-plc/\">offers shareholders a solid</url> forward dividend yield of 6%. In today's market, this kind of yield is hard to ignore, especially given Rio Tinto's ability to generate strong cash flow to back it up.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>That said, 2024 hasn't been smooth sailing for the stock. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RIO/performance\">It's down 21.08% over the past year</url> and 21% year-to-date, with a 6.5% dip just in the past month.\u00a0</p><p>While this might seem concerning, it also opens up an opportunity for investors looking to buy into a quality company at a discount.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>On the valuation front, Rio Tinto\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIO/valuation/metrics\">looks like a bargain</url>. Its forward P/E ratio sits at just 8.5x2, well below the sector average of 15.81x, despite its massive $100.84 billion market cap that cements its place as one of the world's largest miners.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Operationally, the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-releases-third-quarter-212400245.html#:~:text=q3%202024%20operational%20highlights%20%22Q3%202024%20operational%20highlights%22\">company continues to deliver results</url>. Iron ore production in Pilbara rose 1% year-over-year to 84.1 million tonnes, while bauxite production jumped by 8% to 15.1 million tonnes thanks to better plant efficiency.\u00a0</p><p>Copper results were mixed - Oyu Tolgoi saw a strong 19% boost in production with higher grades, but Kennecott faced setbacks due to highwall movement. Meanwhile, Rio Tinto's Safe Production System is driving efficiency gains across its sites and is expected to add another 5 million tonnes of production at Pilbara Iron Ore operations this year.</p><p>CEO Jakob Stausholm summed it up best: \"We continue to strengthen our operations,\" highlighting Rio Tinto's focus on consistency and improvement even during challenging periods.</p><h>Strategic Moves Driving Long-Term Growth</h><p>Rio Tinto is taking big steps to solidify its place in critical minerals and metals, setting itself up for strong growth in the years ahead. One of its most notable moves is the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rio-tinto-buyout-deal-receives-151700220.html\">$6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium</url>, which has already been approved by shareholders and is expected to close by mid-2025.\u00a0</p><p>This all-cash deal, valued at $5.85 per share, will make Rio Tinto the third-largest lithium producer in the world. Lithium is essential for electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage, so this acquisition is a major win for Rio Tinto's future.</p><p>On Dec. 13, 2024, Rio Tinto\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241212756864/en/Rio-Tinto-to-invest-2.5-billion-to-expand-Rincon-lithium-project-capacity-to-60000-tonnes-per-year#:~:text=LONDON--(BUSINESS%20WIRE)--,world-class%20battery%20materials%20portfolio.\">announced a $2.5 billion investment</url> in its Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina, marking its first large-scale lithium operation. The Rincon project is designed to produce 60,000 tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually, with initial production from a smaller 3,000-tonne plant expected by late 2024. This move aligns perfectly with the company's goal of building a top-tier battery materials portfolio to meet growing global demand.</p><p>Rio Tinto isn't stopping at lithium - it's also expanding its copper operations through a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2024/rio-tinto-and-sumitomo-metal-mining-to-partner-on-winu-copper-gold-project\">partnership with Sumitomo Metal Mining</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/SMMYY\">(SMMYY)</url> for the Winu copper-gold project. The deal involves selling a 30% stake for $195 million upfront and $204 million in deferred payments, with final agreements expected in early 2025. Copper plays a key role in electrification and renewable energy systems, making it another smart move for Rio Tinto's long-term strategy.</p><p>Beyond these critical minerals, Rio Tinto has strengthened its aluminum business by\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241031358993/en/Rio-Tinto-completes-acquisition-of-Sumitomo%E2%80%99s-20.64-stake-in-New-Zealand%E2%80%99s-aluminium-smelter\">acquiring Sumitomo's 20.64% stake</url> in New Zealand's aluminum smelter. The company has also deepened its\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4199459-mcewen-mining-secures-additional-35m-investment-from-rio-tinto-venture\">partnership with McEwen Mining</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/quotes/MUX\">(MUX)</url> through a $35 million investment, which will help fund the Los Azules copper project in Argentina. A feasibility study for this project is expected in the first half of 2025.</p><h>Earnings Outlook and Analyst Sentiment</h><p>Rio Tinto's\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.riotinto.com/invest/financial-news-performance/production\">earnings estimates for 2024</url> show a mix of challenges and opportunities as the company works through some operational setbacks. Production guidance for IOC iron ore pellets and concentrate has been adjusted to 9.1 million-9.6 million tonnes, down from the earlier estimate of 9.8million-11.5 million tonnes.\u00a0</p><p>This change came after a mid-July forest fire caused an 11-day shutdown, disrupting operations and forcing a new mine plan. Even so, Pilbara iron ore shipments are still expected to hit a solid 323 million-338 million tonnes, though SP10 levels will likely stay high until replacement projects are wrapped up. While weather and regulatory approvals remain potential hurdles, Rio Tinto's ability to maintain strong production highlights its resilience.</p><p>Analysts remain positive about Rio Tinto's prospects, giving the stock a consensus \"Moderate Buy\" rating. Out of 11 analysts, seven recommend a \"Strong Buy,\" while four suggest holding the stock. The average price target of $83.58 points to impressive upside of about 41.6% from its current price.\u00a0</p><p>This optimistic outlook reflects confidence in Rio Tinto's ability to navigate short-term challenges while staying on track for long-term growth.</p><h>Conclusion</h><p>Rio Tinto offers a rare combination of a high 6% dividend yield, an undervalued stock price, and strong growth potential in critical minerals like lithium and copper. With strategic expansions, robust production plans, and a bullish analyst outlook projecting 41.6% upside, it's positioned for long-term success. As the Arcadium Lithium deal closes in 2025, now is the time to capitalize on this high-yield opportunity before the market catches on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> On the date of publication, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barchart.com/news/authors/354/ebube-jones\">Ebube Jones</url> did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

According to news reporting from Toulouse, France, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"We examined the consequences of deforestation and pasture establishment on H, O and Fe isotope cycling in the hydrosphere, with focus on small watersheds from the central and eastern part of Brazilian Amazonia. The delta O-18- delta D relationships in stream water samples show that the evaporation effect is greater in pasture than in forest, thereby highlighting the impact of deforestation on atmospheric water circulation and rainfall.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include IRD, ATUPS, Universite Paul Sabatier, Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), EC2CO grant. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from the University of Toulouse, \"A clear effect of deforestation was also found on the dissolved load of these streams. Water temperature, pH, conductivity, major cations and dissolved carbon organic content are lower in forest streams compared to those from deforested areas. Dissolved (i.e., filtrate &lt;0.45 mu m) iron concentrations are typically higher in these tropical forest streams. They also show delta Fe-57 signatures commonly higher than that of the continental crust (i.e., &gt; 0.1 parts per thousand). In these black waters enriched in organic matter, the heavier iron isotope composition in the forested areas is related to the oxidized Fe strongly bound to colloidal organic matter. On the other hand, dissolved iron from streams draining older deforested areas shows isotopic compositions usually lighter than the continental crust (delta Fe-57 &lt; 0.1 parts per thousand). The negative delta Fe-57 signatures of these areas are likely caused by deforestation involving erosion and rejuvenation of soils in valleys, which leads to the occurrence of a partial iron reduction in the soils. These modifications increased the proportion of isotopically light, dissolved and more reduced Fe in the streams. Those effects are less obvious on more recent pastures since they display more chemical and isotopic scatter along the sampling months. In a stream flowing through an area undergoing slash and burned deforestation within the year, dissolved iron concentrations and isotopic compositions are much more scattered, with delta Fe-57 values varying by &gt;10 parts per thousand as a result of fire or heavy rain events. This likely depicts the disruption of the iron cycling in the water-soil-plant system with strong changes in the soil mineralogy, organic matter characteristics and biomass activity resulting from the forest fire. Our results suggest that more than a decade is needed to reach a new dynamic steady state of the Fe biogeochemical cycle in pastures. Hence, the contrasted Fe isotopic compositions between the streams draining pristine tropical forests and those from deforested areas indicate that, like H and O isotopes, Fe isotopes are a sensitive indicator of the transformations affecting the biogeochemical cycling of tropical environment in response to deforestation.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"However, in contrast to hydrogen and oxygen isotopes that reveal the exchanges between surface waters and atmosphere, iron isotopes rather highlight the physical-chemical reactions occurring between surface waters and the soils, but with the biomass mediation for all three isotopic tracers.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Impact of Deforestation On the Hydrogen, Oxygen and Iron Isotope Compositions of Amazonian Streams.

The decision came after several petitions were filed by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.under30ceo.com/gen-xers-facing-growing-retirement-concerns/\">retired military personnel who faced</url> delays and inconsistencies in receiving their pension benefits. The court emphasized that any deviation from this rule would be unfair to the ex-servicemen and go against the principles of fair treatment and dignity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ruling directs defense and pension authorities to process and disburse pensions from the date of discharge. Veterans and their families have welcomed the decision, calling it a just recognition of their service and sacrifices. They hope this ruling will streamline pension procedures and eliminate bureaucratic hassles that often cause undue delays.</p><p>The verdict is expected to impact thousands of ex-servicemen across India, providing them with financial security and upholding their post-service rights. In another case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court upheld a woman's right to a liberalized family pension after her husband, an ex-Naik, died while assisting in extinguishing a forest fire near the Indo-China border in 2009.</p><h>Pensions to start from discharge</h><p>The court, however, did not interfere with an order that limited the pension arrears to three years before the filing of her petition due to a significant delay in initiating the claim. The Union of India argued that the petition should have been filed in the Himachal Pradesh High Court, where the cause of action arose. However, the Bench rejected this objection, noting that the impugned order originated from proceedings in Chandigarh, giving the Punjab and Haryana High Court authority over the matter.</p><p>The court reviewed government policies regarding death and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.under30ceo.com/social-security-revises-disability-benefits-evaluation-criteria/\">disability benefits</url>. It affirmed\u00a0the classification of the ex-Naik's death under category 'D,' which applies to personnel fatalities during assistance in civil matters like natural disasters. In a separate case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed the plea of an army <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.under30ceo.com/family-offices-invest-more-in-stocks/\">officer's widow seeking a liberalized family</url> pension beyond the stipulated three-year period. The application, filed over a decade after the officer's death, was rejected due to significant delay and laches.</p><p>The plea was submitted by the widow of Naik Surinder Kumar, who suffered fatal injuries during a firefighting operation near the Indo-China border in 2009. The Court determined that the situation fell under Category \"D\" of the Government policy, as the officer's death occurred while aiding civil administration amid a natural calamity, and dismissed the plea.</p><p>.lwrp.link-whisper-related-posts{ } .lwrp .lwrp-title{ } .lwrp .lwrp-description{ } .lwrp .lwrp-list-container{ font-size: 16px;

According to news reporting originating in Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Traditional methods for fire point segmentation (FPS) in satellite remote sensing images (RSIs) overly rely on threshold judgment, which are greatly affected by factors such as regional time and show poor generalization. Besides, due to the difference between natural scene images (NSIs) and RSIs, directly apply NSIs-based deep learning methods to forest fire RSIs without any modification fails to achieve satisfactory results.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Open Project of Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Alibaba Damo Academy 2023 AI Earth Joint Innovative Research, Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), \"To address these issues, first, we construct a Landsat8 RSI-FPS dataset covering different years, seasons and regions. Then, for the first time, we apply salient object detection (SOD) to FPS in forest fire monitoring and propose a novel network FPS-U2Net to improve the performance of FPS. FPS-U2Net is based on U2Netp (a lightweight U2Net), to make better use of the multi -level features from adjacent encoders, we propose multi -level aggregation module (MAM), which is placed between the encoder and decoder at the same stage to aggregate the adjacent multi -scale features and capture richer contextual information. To make up for the weakness of BCE loss, we employ the hybrid loss, BCE + IoU, for the training of the network, which can guide the network learn the salient information from pixel and map levels. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our FPS-U2Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and SOD methods.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"FPS-U2Net can accurately segment fire regions and predict clear local details.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Fps-u2net: Combining U2net and Multi-level Aggregation Architecture for Fire Point Segmentation In Remote Sensing Images.

LaTourette announced today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents can view where upcoming prescribed burns will be taking place in their communities over a five-day period on a Prescribed Fire Notifications map at njwildfire.org. Additionally, daily notifications are posted on the Forest Fire Services Facebook and Twitter accounts. Residents can also sign up for text or email notifications of prescribed burns by following this link.</p><p>The importance of prescribed burning in New Jerseys forests cannot be overstated, said Commissioner LaTourette. Prescribed burning is a safe activity that is planned with strategic input from multiple DEP programs to reduce and eliminate the materials that fuel wildfires while protecting public safety. Prescribed burning also helps minimize the adverse impacts of climate change by limiting significant and harmful releases of carbon during wildfires.</p><p>This year, the Forest Fire Service intends to treat 25,000 acres of forests, grasslands and marsh with prescribed fire. Meeting the targeted acreage will depend on favorable weather conditions from February through April, when most prescribed burning takes place in New Jersey.</p><p>Role Of Prescribed Burning</p><p>In addition to reducing forest floor fuels, prescribed burning improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>Prescribed burning is a crucial tool in our efforts to maintain the ecological health and fire resiliency of New Jersey's landscapes, said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests and Historic Sites. By carefully managing fire in a controlled manner, we can reduce the risk of devastating wildfires and conserve the state's rich natural heritage for future generations.</p><p>Prescribed burning is a critical part of the states carbon defense strategy because it allows experts to direct the intensity, timing and interval of fire across the landscape. Prescribed burning reduces the fuel available to support large, high-intensity wildfires that can cause significant carbon losses. It also improves soil health by promoting nutrient cycling and reducing soil compaction, leading to increased plant growth and carbon sequestration.</p><p>Most of the Forest Fire Services burns will occur on state-owned property such as forests, parks and Wildlife Management Areas, but the Forest Fire Service also assists private landowners, nonprofit organizations, and county and municipal governments to meet their management objectives through prescribed burning. Landowners interested in the Forest Fire Services assistance in conducting a prescribed burn on their property should contact their regional Forest Fire Service office.</p><p>Factors That Impact Prescribed Burning</p><p>Several climatological and environmental conditions, all of which influence a burns intensity and severity, are considered when conducting prescribed burns to accomplish various resource and ecological objectives, such as reducing hazard fuels and managing habitats. The Forest Fire Service and Division of Air Quality work together to assess wind speed, humidity and temperature and to determine the best days to conduct prescribed burning. Other factors considered include the density and arrangement of the vegetation being burned.</p><p>While most prescribed burns take place in the spring, a prescribed burn may be implemented in the summer or fall depending on the management objective for a particular area. The Prescribed Burn Act, which Governor Phil Murphy signed into law in August 2018, authorized the Forest Fire Service to use prescribed burning as a tool to meet a wider range of management objectives designed to improve forest health and conditions for plants and animals. For example, prescribed burning can be an effective tool in managing the spread of nonnative invasive species or to manage grasslands for threatened or endangered bird species.</p><p>Most burning takes place throughout the New Jersey Pinelands, a fire-adapted ecosystem which needs fire to thrive. Pitch pine, the dominant species of pine in New Jersey, have serotinous cones, which means they remain closed until exposed to high heat from fire, at which point they release their seeds. Additionally, pitch pine trees are able to sprout new growth from their roots or stump, allowing them to quickly recover and colonize a burned area.</p><p>Motorists are reminded to use caution when approaching areas where prescribed burns are taking place, pay attention to reduced speed limits and be alert to the presence of Forest Fire Service trucks and personnel that may be working alongside roadways.</p><p>In 2022, the Forest Fire Service completed prescribed burns on 11,925 acres of state-owned lands, 3,363 acres of other government-owned land and 1,694 acres of privately owned property, for a total of 16,982 acres.</p><p>New Jerseyans are reminded that peak wildfire season often directly follows prescribed burn season. When in doubt about the source of smoke or whether a fire is part of a prescribed burning operation, call 1-877-WARN-DEP (1-877-927-6337) or 911.</p><p>Additional Wildfire Fuel Mitigation Strategies</p><p>The Forest Fire Service works alongside the New Jersey Forest Service to develop forest management plans which protect lives, property and natural resources from wildfire.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service has launched the Allen and Oswego Road Fire Mitigation and Habitat Restoration Project in Bass River State Forest because an extreme density of trees combined with other forest fuels make the area too dangerous to treat with prescribed fire alone. The project, which gained New Jersey Pinelands Commission approval in October 2022, is set to mimic the effects of wildfire through the use of mechanized equipment. Once complete, a 25-foot firebreak will exist on either side of Allen and Oswego roads, 1,305 acres of thinning will remove highly flammable materials known as ladder fuels throughout the area and 13 miles of roadway will be improved, allowing safe and efficient access for emergency vehicles. More information about the project may be found here.</p><p>A similar project along Washington Turnpike in Wharton State Forest helped limit the spread of the Mullica River Wildfire last year, New Jerseys largest wildfire in 15 years.</p><p>The Mullica River Wildfire which burned 11,129.5 acres in the Wharton State Forest in June of 2022 was a reminder to New Jerseyans that the potential for large-scale wildfires exists in the Garden State, said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator and Chief of the Forest Fire Service. Through prescribed burning and developing forest management plans strategically in key areas of forest, we can help limit the spread of a major wildfire across the landscape, saving lives and property and aiding in protecting firefighters.</p><p>Additional forest management projects aimed to limit the spread of wildfires are ongoing at other state-owned property including Double Trouble State Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125719896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67HK-2GW1-JCBF-S0WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1215\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 10, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The state remains at extreme risk for fires because of the lack of rain.</p><p>Brush fires were reported Saturday off Beach Pond Road in Voluntown and in the area of Ayers Mountain in Franklin. The fire in Franklin, reported at 6 a.m., led to temporary closure of a portion of Route 207, as crews from multiple town hiked into a wooded area to fight the blaze.</p><p>Franklin Emergency Management Director Bill Eyeberse said the state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security aided the firefight by sending a helicopter to drop water on areas of steep terrain that were nearly impossible for firefighters to access on foot.</p><p>The helicopter and work of firefighters helped to contain the fire to 4 to 6 acres, Eyeberse said. The fire was reported to be contained by 11 a.m. DEEP crews continued to monitor the area into Saturday afternoon. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p>The burn ban issued on Saturday bars the use of outdoor grills, fire pits, campfires and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests and wildlife management areas.</p><p>In a statement, DEEP said the burn ban is part of an effort to prevent new fires and as a proactive measure to avoid overtaxing available fire-fighting resources during the dry spell.</p><p>\"These conditions represent a real and immediate threat to communities across Connecticut. We need every resident and visitor to understand that their actions directly impact the safety of their neighbors, firefighters, and natural areas,\"  DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. \"Taking this step today could save lives.\"</p><p>Firefighters continued work on Saturday to extinguish a fire that has consumed more than 100 acres on Lamentation Mountain in Berlin over the past week Fire officials said a campfire that was not extinguished properly likely started that fire. Veteran Wethersfield firefighter Robert E. Sharkevich Sr., a 66-year-old married father of four, died this week when a utility vehicle rolled onto him on steep terrain while fighting the Lamentation Mountain fire.</p><p>All open burning permits statewide are also suspended until further notice. .</p><p>For more information on fire danger and wildfire prevention, visit the Wildfire Prevention page on the DEEP website or contact the DEEP fire danger hotline at 860-424-3929. For more information about today's fire danger level, which is very high, go here: Forest Fire Danger Report.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.smith@theday.com\">g.smith@theday.com</email></p><p>To reduce fire risks, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection urges the following safety measures:</p><p>Fires on public lands are prohibited: Do not use campfires, grills, or any other open flame. Again, the ban announced today prohibits the use of outdoor grills, firepits, and campfires, and the kindling and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas. This prohibition includes smoking and use of lighters outdoors.</p><p>Properly extinguish smoking materials: Ensure all cigarettes and similar items are fully put out before disposal.</p><p>Avoid equipment that can spark fires: Refrain from using ATVs, chainsaws, or other equipment in dry areas.</p><p>If you observe a wildfire, call 911 immediately and provide the location to emergency dispatch. Timely reporting is crucial to containing fires before they spread further.</p><p>___ (c)2024 The Day (New London, Conn.)

Ned Lamont because of a series of brush fires that have ignited across the state over the past week. The state remains at extreme risk for fires because of the lack of rain.</p><p>Brush fires were reported Saturday off Beach Pond Road in Voluntown and in the area of Ayers Mountain in Franklin. The fire in Franklin, reported at 6 a.m., led to temporary closure of a portion of Route 207, as crews from multiple town hiked into a wooded area to fight the blaze.</p><p>Franklin Emergency Management Director Bill Eyeberse said the state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security aided the firefight by sending a helicopter to drop water on areas of steep terrain that were nearly impossible for firefighters to access on foot.</p><p>The helicopter and work of firefighters helped to contain the fire to 4 to 6 acres, Eyeberse said. The fire was reported to be contained by 11 a.m. DEEP crews continued to monitor the area into Saturday afternoon. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p><p>The burn ban issued on Saturday bars the use of outdoor grills, fire pits, campfires and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests and wildlife management areas.</p><p>In a statement, DEEP said the burn ban is part of an effort to prevent new fires and as a proactive measure to avoid overtaxing available fire-fighting resources during the dry spell.</p><p>\"These conditions represent a real and immediate threat to communities across Connecticut. We need every resident and visitor to understand that their actions directly impact the safety of their neighbors, firefighters, and natural areas,\"  DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. \"Taking this step today could save lives.\"</p><p>Firefighters continued work on Saturday to extinguish a fire that has consumed more than 100 acres on Lamentation Mountain in Berlin over the past week Fire officials said a campfire that was not extinguished properly likely started that fire. Veteran Wethersfield firefighter Robert E. Sharkevich Sr., a 66-year-old married father of four, died this week when a utility vehicle rolled onto him on steep terrain while fighting the Lamentation Mountain fire.</p><p>All open burning permits statewide are also suspended until further notice. .</p><p>For more information on fire danger and wildfire prevention, visit the Wildfire Prevention page on the DEEP website or contact the DEEP fire danger hotline at 860-424-3929. For more information about today's fire danger level, which is very high, go here: Forest Fire Danger Report.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:g.smith@theday.com\">g.smith@theday.com</email></p><p>To reduce fire risks, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection urges the following safety measures:</p><p>Fires on public lands are prohibited: Do not use campfires, grills, or any other open flame. Again, the ban announced today prohibits the use of outdoor grills, firepits, and campfires, and the kindling and use of flame outdoors in all state parks, forests, and wildlife management areas. This prohibition includes smoking and use of lighters outdoors.</p><p>Properly extinguish smoking materials: Ensure all cigarettes and similar items are fully put out before disposal.</p><p>Avoid equipment that can spark fires: Refrain from using ATVs, chainsaws, or other equipment in dry areas.</p><p>If you observe a wildfire, call 911 immediately and provide the location to emergency dispatch.

According to news reporting out of Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Infrared remote sensing imaging plays a crucial role in military observation, nighttime security surveillance, forest fire monitoring, and so on. In these applications, detecting dim small targets has always been a challenging problem, especially in complex backgrounds and low-contrast conditions.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Guangdong Provincial Key Labo- ratory of Cyber-Physical System. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Guangdong University of Technology, \"Existing model-driven methods usually lack robustness in handling noise and small-size targets. Deep learning-based approaches are heavily dependent on data and have limitations in feature processing and fusion, leading to missed detections and false alarms. To address these issues, we propose a small target detection method for infrared images with image super-resolution technology and deep learning. Firstly, we apply super-resolution image preprocessing and multiple data augmentation to the input infrared images. Secondly, we develop a deep-learning network based on YOLO called YOLO-SR, which incorporates a bottleneck transformer block after the spatial pyramid pooling module in the backbone layer to capture long-range dependencies in the infrared images. We design a C3-Neck module in the neck layer to better extract and fuse spatial and channel information.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves mAP@0.5 scores of 95.2% on the public datasets and effectively addresses the issues of missed detections and false alarms compared to current state-of-the-art data-driven detection methods.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Infrared Small Target Detection With Super-resolution and Yolo.

According to news reporting originating from Busan, South Korea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are caused by various climatic and anthropogenic factors. In Republic of Korea, forest fires occur frequently during spring when the humidity is low.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Ministry of Interior And Safety. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Pukyong National University: \"During the past decade, the number of forest fire incidents and the extent of the damaged area have increased. Satellite imagery can be applied to assess damage from these unpredictable forest fires. Despite the increasing threat, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and effective strategies for addressing these forest fires, particularly considering the diverse topography of Republic of Korea. Herein, we present an approach for the automated detection of forest fire damage using Sentinel-2 images of 14 areas affected by forest fires in Republic of Korea during 2019-2023. The detection performance of deep learning (DL), machine learning, and spectral index methods was analyzed, and the optimal model for detecting forest fire damage was derived. To evaluate the independent performance of the models, two different burned areas exhibiting distinct characteristics were selected as test subjects. To increase the classification accuracy, tests were conducted on various combinations of input channels in DL.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The combination of false-color RNG (B4, B8, and B3) images was optimal for detecting forest fire damage. Consequently, among the DL models, the HRNet model achieved excellent results for both test regions with intersection over union scores of 89.40 and 82.49, confirming that the proposed method is applicable for detecting forest fires in diverse Korean landscapes. Thus, suitable mitigation measures can be promptly designed based on the rapid analysis of damaged areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Single-Temporal Sentinel-2 for Analyzing Burned Area Detection Methods: A Study of 14 Cases in Republic of Korea Considering Land Cover.

The Park Fire has scorched more than 660 square miles since erupting July 24 near the Sacramento Valley city of Chico and burning northward up the western flank of the Sierra Nevada. </p><p>Containment remained at 34 percent, Cal Fire said. The conflagration's early explosive growth quickly made it California's fourth-largest wildfire on record before favorable weather reduced its intensity late last week. It reawakened this week due to the heat and very low relative humidity levels. A large portion of the burned area was in mop-up stage but spot fires were a continuing problem, officials said during Thursday morning's operational briefing. The fire's northeast corner was the top firefighting priority, operations deputy Jed Gaines said. \"It's not time to celebrate,\" he said. \"We got several more days of hard work to hold what we got in there.\" The latest Park Fire assessments found 636 structures destroyed and 49 damaged. A local man was arrested after authorities alleged he started the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness park outside Chico. About 100 miles to the south, a new forest fire in El Dorado County was exhibiting extreme behavior, and some Park Fire aircraft were being diverted there. The Crozier Fire, about 10 miles north of Placerville, had burned more than 2 square miles of timber and chaparral as of Thursday evening and was just 5 percent contained. The fire threatens 1,625 structures, according to Cal Fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001913782df1ea9d5ffeaa42e0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CX0-TKX1-JBSK-R0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"272\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 9, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000112</classCode><className>ARRESTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires are one of the world's deadliest natural disasters.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include 2020 Beijing Higher Education \u201cundergraduate Teaching Reform And Innovation Project\u201d; 2020 Teaching Reform Research Project of The Teaching Instruction Committee of Electronic Information; 2020 Education Teaching Reform Research Project of Beijing Technology And Business University; 2021 Talent Training Quality Construction Project of Beijing Technology And Business University. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Technology and Business University: \"Early detection of forest fires can help minimize the damage to ecosystems and forest life. In this paper, we propose an improved fire detection method YOLOv5-IFFDM for YOLOv5. Firstly, the fire and smoke detection accuracy and the network perception accuracy of small targets are improved by adding an attention mechanism to the backbone network. Secondly, the loss function is improved and the SoftPool pyramid pooling structure is used to improve the regression accuracy and detection performance of the model and the robustness of the model. In addition, a random mosaic augmentation technique is used to enhance the data to increase the generalization ability of the model, and re-clustering of flame and smoke detection a priori frames are used to improve the accuracy and speed. Finally, the parameters of the convolutional and normalization layers of the trained model are homogeneously merged to further reduce the model processing load and to improve the detection speed.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Experimental results on self-built forest-fire and smoke datasets show that this algorithm has high detection accuracy and fast detection speed, with average accuracy of fire up to 90.5% and smoke up to 84.3%, and detection speed up to 75 FPS (frames per second transmission), which can meet the requirements of real-time and efficient fire detection.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Research on Forest Fire Detection Algorithm Based on Improved YOLOv5.

According to news originating from Sofia, Bulgaria, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The preservation of forest ecosystems is of vital importance to life on our planet.\" </p><p><br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Technical University of Sofia: \"The increased losses of forests due to fires make the task of forest fire prevention of crucial significance. The present paper describes the development of an artificial neural network (ANN) for forest fire early prediction. The ANN predictor consists of two layers with 5 neurons in the hidden layer. It is trained through backpropagation of an error learning algorithm and is validated to provide prediction with a high degree of accuracy. An additional advantage of the designed predictor is the use of a limited number of input data based on weather and moisture conditions and of an output of a prior computed probability for fire.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The training and validation datasets consist of 82 records of real measurement data. The developed and validated ANN can contribute to improvement of the current forest fire prediction systems.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Application of Artificial Neural Network in Wildfire Early Prediction Systems.

Kennedy asked Congress to establish the U.S. Agency for International Development in 1961, he rooted its mission in America's strategic interests and its \"moral obligations as a wise leader and good neighbor,\" recognizing that poverty and instability threaten America's prosperity and security. That convergence of interests and values, upheld across Republican and Democratic administrations, is now at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.A.I.D. is not a perfect agency. No government institution is. But from the Green Revolution to humanitarian relief to the fight against H.I.V., it has built a more stable world while advancing U.S. interests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, under the guise of a foreign aid \"review,\" Elon Musk and President Trump have frozen U.S.A.I.D. money and activities and appear to be working to dismantle the agency and almost entirely eliminate foreign aid programs. The few waivers that have been granted have not unfrozen a significant amount of money. As the testimonials below from around the world show, the immediate impact has been damaging and chaotic.</p><p>It is not too late to salvage the agency and its mission. The agency's partner organizations are hanging on and its overseas missions seem to have remained mostly intact, for now. The laws establishing U.S.A.I.D. in federal statute and its budget appropriation remain in force and unaltered.</p><p>But Mr. Musk's assault appears to be operating outside of any lawful or congressional process, so Congress and the courts must intervene. Multiple lawsuits have been filed, with two prompting restraining orders. But saving foreign aid will ultimately come down to whether Congress uses its constitutional leverage over the administration.</p><p>Lawmakers should consider how they will explain in the coming years why America could no longer stop a disease outbreak overseas from reaching the homeland. Or why thousands of children who depended on lifesaving nutritional supplies made in American plants were left to die. Or why China is capitalizing on the vacuums left by America's retreat.</p><p>None of those effects point to a safer or more prosperous future for America.</p><p>The following testimonies were gathered by the Times Opinion staff. Some individuals spoke on condition of anonymity. Some interviews have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.</p><p>Africa</p><p>Sudan Humanitarian aid</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. has helped support the network of Emergency Response Rooms across Sudan, civilian-led groups that provide food and other humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of people during the country's continuing civil war, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the E.R.R.s. Famine has already been confirmed in or is projected to take hold in 10 parts of the country.</p><p>\"At this moment, we're trying our best to utilize the resources we have, but the way we're doing it is using all the money we have from somewhere else. Really quickly, it's just going to deplete. We have no clue if U.S.A.I.D. money is going to kick back in, or it's just gone,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're just keeping everybody alive, and Sudan is on the verge of an outbreak of famine... A week of not finding food would actually mean a lot of death.\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure who the United States is. At this point it's hard for me to tell.\"</p><p>Kenya H.I.V. and tuberculosis treatment</p><p>The U.S.A.I.D. freeze has devastated tuberculosis and maternal H.I.V. programs at the Mathare North Health Center, which serves some of Nairobi's poorest.</p><p>The X-ray machine that had been operated by workers supported by U.S.A.I.D. grants to diagnose tuberculosis is no longer running because the personnel trained to operate it were forced out of work. \"Some patients will go home undetected and they will spread more deadly, multidrug-resistant TB,\" said Margaret Odera, a local community health worker. \"Viruses and bacteria don't need passports to travel.\"</p><p>On a recent Monday, 17 pregnant or lactating women with H.I.V. went to the center for H.I.V. medication to prevent the transmission of the virus to their babies, but the workers who usually managed the program were not there to provide the medication, Ms. Odera said.</p><p>Ms. Odera, who is H.I.V. positive, is afraid that Kenyans will lose access to H.I.V. medications that the United States has historically helped to pay for and deliver. \"I am drained thinking about what will happen to my children if I can't get my medication,\" she said.</p><p>Nigeria Childhood malnutrition</p><p>After the Trump administration issued its stop-work order, an international nonprofit whose work was partly supported by U.S.A.I.D. began running out of ready-to-use therapeutic food for severely malnourished children in three states, according to a senior humanitarian coordinator at the U.S.-based organization.</p><p>For weeks, the official said, the food sat in a warehouse that was waiting for permission from Washington to reopen its doors. Once that permission came through, staff members who would normally distribute the food were unavailable because their employer did not have the funding or permission to let them work.</p><p>Even as these problems get resolved, larger disruptions to the pipeline that supplies this lifesaving food may persist and prevent enough from reaching the area, the official said. \"Our teams have requested funding to purchase the food locally to meet the demand. They are anticipating very high needs this summer, and they are concerned the food supply won't be enough.\"</p><p>\"We are plugging leaks in a system that is a dam that's about to burst,\" the official said. \"How do we keep up with this, as the supply chains begin to break?\"</p><p>Burkina Faso Human rights</p><p>The government's war against Islamist insurgents has escalated in Burkina Faso, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, the displacement of three million people, rampaging militias supported by the government and the forced conscription of government opponents.</p><p>The Collective Against Impunity and Stigmatization of Communities provides legal and psychological support for victims, as well as food and financial aid. U.S.A.I.D. funds its monitoring program, which employs some 40 people across the vast country to report on acts of violence and repression, said Daniel Salif Gnienhoun, the group's permanent secretary. When the funds run out, these workers and their families will lose their source of income but worse, human rights violations will go unreported, he said.</p><p>\"The human rights will be getting worse and worse,\" Mr. Gnienhoun said. \"Our rights will be violated, and no voice will be raised denouncing what's going on in the country,\" he said, adding \"The government will have the green light to do whatever they want. They can kill innocent civilians because nothing can be reported.\"</p><p>Asia</p><p>Afghanistan Education</p><p>Classes at the American University of Afghanistan, an online school supported by U.S.A.I.D. and one of the last remaining options for higher education for women in the country, have been suspended since January.</p><p>\"Last year, when I got accepted to AUAF, I was super happy. It was like something impossible for me that happened - being in an American university and engaged with different kinds of students from all of Afghanistan and different kinds of teachers from the entire world,\" said one female student living in Afghanistan.</p><p>\"At first, when I heard [classes were suspended], I was kind of depressed. I didn't want to do anything,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's been a long time that [America] has been supporting Afghanistan, Afghan girls - maybe the students of the entire world. This is a situation where girls should be supported; it's not like before, when we could go to university. Right now we're just stuck in the corner of the house. We're in a cage, and we really need support.\"</p><p>Indonesia Health care</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. is one of the largest providers of health care aid to Indonesia, especially for maternal and newborn health, H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria. Some local groups have had to lay off staff members, including more than 100 outreach workers who assist patients seeking H.I.V. treatment.</p><p>\"A major Indonesian government program to revamp access to primary care is supported in part by a U.S.A.I.D. project focused on maternal and newborn health, which has now been halted. Given Indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates, this setback could significantly impair the country's efforts to reduce these rates as part of its broader health goals,\" said Dr. Marcia Soumokil, director of reproductive health nonprofit Ipas Indonesia.</p><p>Cambodia Human trafficking</p><p>The Berlin-based Freedom Collaborative network serves as a clearinghouse of information and an adviser for groups in countries helping people who were forced to work in cyberscam compounds. The F.B.I. said that in 2023, Americans potentially lost $12.5 billion in such scams.</p><p>Now, with most all of its funding halted by U.S.A.I.D., the Freedom Collaborative will no longer be able to help local groups, including the main shelter in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a country that is one of the largest havens of cyberscam operations, said Julia Macher, Freedom Collaborative's chief executive.</p><p>\"Even if survivors can get out of the compounds, they have no place to put them,\" she said. \"They have no place to go, and they have no money to fly back home.\" Nor will they be able to afford medical treatment, including for broken limbs Jumping out of windows is one of the escape methods.</p><p>Thailand Climate change</p><p>\"We help people across Southeast Asia and South Asia manage their forests and adapt to a changing climate,\" explained David Ganz, executive director of RECOFTC, a nonprofit headquartered in Bangkok. \"Some U.S.A.I.D.-funded programs had to stop immediately One of our forest fire management projects in the Mekong River region is now on pause, and we are entering the agricultural burning season and hot summer, which significantly increases the risk of wildfires. The uncertainty of this freeze is preventing us from planning long-term.\"</p><p>\"The Philippines and Bangladesh rely heavily on U.S.A.I.D., especially for humanitarian responses after super-typhoons, droughts, floods and other natural disasters. With the freeze, deforestation and wildlife crime are likely to go up again in the region just when we were making some headway on addressing these threats to biodiversity and ecosystems.\"</p><p>Latin America and the Caribbean</p><p>Colombia Strengthening civil society</p><p>U.S.A.I.D. helped support the organization Fundaci\u00f3n Paz y Reconciliaci\u00f3n through Tetra Tech ARD, a consulting group.</p><p>\"In Colombia, there is still an armed conflict - including armed groups and threats from organized crime. These programs sought better prevention of human rights violations through early warnings,\" said Laura Bonilla, Fundaci\u00f3n Paz y Reconciliaci\u00f3n's deputy director. \"If there were threats of forced displacement or the murder of a human rights defender, we could warn people. It's fundamental to save these people because they're resisting where armed groups have great influence.\"</p><p>\"Catatumbo is one of the regions where the most coca is planted. So cutting the cooperation between U.S.A.I.D., communities and the state strengthens armed groups.\"</p><p>\"The United States had been a key partner in maintaining stability in the region. So we're going to see a more destabilized Colombia. It's not a good idea to leave us alone.\"</p><p>Guatemala Preventing violence against women</p><p>\"You're going to see the impact in Guatemala and Honduras,\" a staffer working in Central America for an international nongovernmental organization said.</p><p>\"We're responding to one of the biggest challenges in Central America violence against women and girls.\"</p><p>The worker explained \"We provided legal and psychosocial resources to help women earn a living and address justice for them. We gave women cash vouchers to find shelter, but the shelters don't feed people. The shelters don't cover the cost of a bus to a city where a judge can hear a woman's case. Our paralegals are there to accompany them. We know that we are leaving women without any income or support.\"</p><p>Haiti Preventing malnutrition</p><p>After the aid freeze, Action Against Hunger shut down a program that worked with about 13,000 Haitians to educate families about better nutrition and provided training for pregnant and breastfeeding women, among other services.</p><p>Martine Villeneuve, Action Against Hunger's country director in Haiti, said</p><p>\"About half of the population is dependent on humanitarian aid, and the number of people living in food insecurity and facing issues of malnutrition has continued to increase since 2016. So we are close to catastrophe.\"</p><p>\"Half of the country is hungry. Having projects that help to diversify the kind of food that you are buying - including understanding the impact of buying local food that is full of nutrients and comes from the farmer next to you - it's also a cycle of life that helps to re-establish the country.\"</p><p>Middle East</p><p>Syria Humanitarian aid</p><p>Some 2.6 million people in northeastern Syria depend on 50 nongovernmental organizations, many of them mostly funded by U.S.A.I.D.'s Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs. Hundreds of thousands of those people are in shelters, emergency \"collection centers\" and camps for displaced people, including two holding tens of thousands of family members of suspected ISIS militants.</p><p>\"We are seeing complete destruction of what once was a humanitarian response. That will not only have direct human implications but a destabilizing security impact across the region,\" said a senior official coordinating the humanitarian response in northeast Syria. \"Even non-U.S.-funded efforts will effectively be shut down,\" the official added. \"It's impossible to deliver an education or protection program where food, fuel and water is not being delivered.\"</p><p>U.S.A.I.D.-funded health care serves 1.65 million people in the area, the official said. Those services have been drastically cut. How many will die? \"We can't see them. They're not even making it to a health care center,\" the official said.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Ukraine Children's welfare</p><p>\"An estimated 1.6 million Ukrainian children remain at risk of forced deportation, indoctrination, militarization and identity erasure under Russian occupation,\" said Darya Kasyanova, head of the board of the Ukrainian Child Rights Network. \"The occupation authorities are systematically forcing Ukrainian children into Russian schools, military training camps and programs designed to erase their national identity and prepare them to become a part of Russian armed forces.\"</p><p>\"Our project was designed to provide these children and their caregivers with vital information on how to recognize these dangers and where to seek help. People in temporarily occupied territories live in an extremely restricted information space and often do not even know that rescue services exist or where to turn for help.\"</p><p>\"The suspension of U.S.A.I.D. funding has severely impacted both the Ukrainian Child Rights Network and our 40 member organizations.\"</p><p>\"Without immediate action, more children will be permanently separated from their families and integrated into Russian-controlled structures, violating their fundamental rights and Ukraine's future.\"</p><p>Moldova Supporting independent media</p><p>\"Right now, we have everyone's salaries covered for the next two months, but there's no predictability after that. Most independent media in Moldova is supported by grants,\" Anastasia Condruc, editor in chief of Moldova.org, an independent media organization, said. \"The state funds a public TV channel and radio broadcaster. If Moldova.org can't produce more journalism, I think many vulnerable voices will remain unheard, especially victims of domestic violence or sexual harassment.</p><p>Many projects in road-building, business, agriculture and education in Moldova have been paused, and hopes are not high that the funds will return, honestly. It's hard to estimate the damage done, especially in the long term. We're afraid the void left by the U.S. might be filled by Russia. We see local pro-Russian politicians celebrating the funding freeze.\"</p><p>(Reporting by Eliza Barclay, Daniela Cobos, Alex Ellerbach, Louise Loftus, Krista Mahr, Neel Patel and Daniel J.

We have a lot worth protecting here: the environment, the people who live here, and the people who come here to visit and recharge,\" said Pasztory. Deputy Minister of Interior Besfort Lamallari, General Director of the National Agency of Protected Areas Daniel Pirushi, local authorities and officials from the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities also participated at the event.</p><p>The equipment - purchased under the OSCE's pilot project \"Fire Resilient Protected Areas: Shar/Sara Mountains and Korab Massif Area\" - consisted of a motorized firefighting system, power air blower, backpack pumps, multifunctional tools, fire brooms, drip torches, and forest fire suits for 20 firefighters.</p><p>The project aims to enhance landscape fire management and community involvement in fire prevention efforts. The project supported the development of a scoping study on addressing shared climate-related security challenges that identified fires as one of the climate-related security risks in the area. Building on the scoping study, the project also supported a joint co-operation strategy on climate change and security in the Shar/Sara Mountains and Korab Massif Area and its implementation plan.</p><p>The pilot project is implemented within the framework of the OSCE's extra-budgetary project \"Strengthening responses to security risks from climate change in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia\".</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.osce.org/presence-in-albania/567983\">https://www.osce.org/presence-in-albania/567983</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8608625 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8608625</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BYJ-41B1-JC11-10XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"330\"/><timeReceived>3:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 4, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY &amp; COOPERATION IN EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX019</classCode><className>VIENNA, AUSTRIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC399</classCode><className>ALBANIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR126</classCode><className>CENTRAL ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GR169</classCode><className>SOUTHERN EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC346</classCode><className>AUSTRIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR146</classCode><className>EASTERN EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
