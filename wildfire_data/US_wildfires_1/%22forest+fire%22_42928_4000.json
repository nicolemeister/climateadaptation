According to news reporting out of Pune, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Severity of wildfires witnessed in different parts of the world in the recent times has posed a significant challenge to fire control authorities. Even when the different fire early warning systems have been developed to provide the quickest warnings about the possible wildfire location, severity, and danger, often it is difficult to deploy the resources quickly to contain the wildfire at a short notice.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC): \"Response time is further delayed when the terrain is complex. Early warning systems based on physics-based models, such as WRF-FIRE/SFIRE, are computationally intensive and require high performance computing resources and significant data related to fuel properties and climate to generate forecasts at short intervals of time (i.e., hourly basis). It is therefore that when the objective is to develop monthly and yearly forecasts, time series models seem to be useful as they require lesser computation power and limited data (as compared to physics-based models). Long duration forecasts are useful in preparing an efficient fire management plan for optimal deployment of resources in the event of forest fire. The present research is aimed at forecasting the number of fires in different forest types of India on a monthly basis using 'Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average' time series models (both univariate and with regressors) at 25 km x 25 km spatial resolution (grid) and developing the fire susceptibility maps using Geographical Information System. The performance of models was validated based on the autocorrelation function (ACF), partial ACF, cumulative periodogram, and Portmanteau (L-Jung Box) test. Both the univariate- and regressor-based models performed equally well; however, the univariate model was preferred due to parsimony. The R software package was used to run and test the model. The forecasted active fire counts were tested against the original 3 years monthly forecasts from 2015 to 2017. The variation in coefficient of determination from 0.94 (for year 1 forecast) to 0.64 (when all the 3-year forecasts were considered together) was observed for tropical dry deciduous forests.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"These values varied from 0.98 to 0.89 for tropical moist deciduous forest and from 0.97 to 0.88 for the tropical evergreen forests. The forecasted active fire counts were used to estimate the future forest fire frequency ratio, which has been used as an indicator of forest fire susceptibility.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forecasting wildfires in major forest types of India.

Undetermined 2024 sales = $ 5.0 million 2. Undetermined 2024 revenue = $ 65.0 billion 3. Undetermined 2024 revenue = $ 104.0 billion 4. Undetermined 2024 operating margin = 45.0 %</p><p>PRESENTATION</p><p>Presentation 1. Based on which key metric you want to look at if you think about revenue growth, up more than 50% year over year. 2. Another key metric that I think is important to grasp is that the number of customers that spend more than $5 million a year with us on OCI directly, this doesn't include the other parts of our business, it's not talking about database license revenue or support, but just on cloud infrastructure has grown 42% year over year. 3. This, along with all the other investments we're making into our general-purpose public cloud is what's causing us to have such high growth, for example, and the number of customers spending more than $10 million in the enterprise space year over year. 4. 162% year over year growth in the number of customers in this category, more than 2.5 times capacity increase compared to where we were a year ago, serving these customers, and more than $3 billion in TCV of wins in Q1. 5. So we announced 50, we ended up delivering over 100 over the last year, and we showed those are to all of our customers because all of our SaaS customers get those quarterly update. 6. So the leverage on top of AI OCI in some ways, 100% done. 7. So financial supply chain, HCM, CX released on average 100 features to all of our customers. 8. About 80% of those are driven from customer requests. 9. And we have metrics that show that it's working in the last quarter, these recommendations had an 11% conversion rate customers use them to do an additional $5 million of sales, and we're just getting started. 10. Again, we provide all of the typical services that you would expect from a telco fixed mobile, TV, IoT, and we have around 300 million customers. 11. But fortunately that started and today we have over 20,000 terabytes, which we think is around 70% of all of the data in terms of analytics that we want to -- into our that actually already there. 12. So as we reported during earnings RPO, RPO is now greater than $99 billion. 13. It's up 52% year-over-year. 14. This figure has grown rapidly and clearly shows the pent-up interest and demand in the Oracle Cloud, which is now almost three quarters of the total RPO amount and is up 80% year over year, actually over 80%. 15. Now the historical RPO size is driving our ability to accelerate revenue growth as we forecast last quarter and we confirm again on this week's earnings call, we expect to deliver at least 10% revenue growth this fiscal year. 16. Using our previously committed FY26 revenue target of $65 billion, the implied growth rate for FY26 is 12%. 17. Now not only are we confident in our ability to meet this target, but we expect to exceed it. 18. In fact, we believe the minimum footprint of our competitors is over 140 times larger to get started compared to what Oracle offers. 19. It's moved from a 12% CAGR a few years ago to now 46% over the last two years. 20. As you can see, cloud now represents 72% of RPO, up from 46%, four years ago. 21. And with the close of Q1, we now have an RPO value that's greater than $99 billion. 22. Similarly, we more than double in the last four years, the movement of our infrastructure support base to the cloud. 23. So if we look at the last fiscal year, we experienced a 4x uplift in air are applications and a 5x uplift in infrastructure that's even better than I talked about last year, when we discussed the same multiples using these improved conversion rates resulted in a potential incremental revenue opportunity for Oracle of around $85 billion. 24. So it went up from 10,000 new customers in FY23 to 11,000 last year. 25. We now have over 80,000 customers. 26. First off, the Oracle database remains highly ubiquitous and used by 94% of the Fortune 100. 27. If you look at over the last four years, our net dollar retention rate and our support base, it's 102%. 28. We have very strong pipelines that are growing very significantly, and we expect it to be a more and more meaningful impact to our financials as we move forward. 29. And in fact, we have over 450 joint customers with Microsoft Azure. 30. And yet over the course of the next four years from 2016 to 2020, we grew the number of megawatts under management by 20x. 31. And then between 2020 and 2024, we grew number of megawatts under 4x. 32. So as you've now heard, we're going to double CapEx this fiscal year. 33. That increase in CapEx spend is the precursor to accelerating revenue. 34. So as you see over the last five years with more capacity coming online, the percentage of our software revenue that's coming from cloud compared to license and support is now double. 35. That's about 45%. 36. We expect that percentage will continue to go up given license and support is a slowly declining business compared to the hyper growth that we're seeing from the cloud. 37. When you look at the gross profit contribution standpoint, we are adding many more dollars to our bottom line compared to the decline from lost dollars to license and support. 38. In fact, what we've been seeing is about for every $5 of added gross profit in cloud compared to an average of $1 loss. 39. So the bottom line is as we move to the cloud, we are able to accelerate the growth of both our top line total revenue as well as our bottom line, total income dollars as we make the transition to the cloud and cloud becomes a bigger and bigger percentage of our overall business. 40. Now what does this all mean for our financial outlook, what we've all been waiting for based on the strong backlog that we've discussed today, we are now even more confident in our ability to achieve our FY26 revenue targets that we've previously issued. 41. In fact, we are raising our revenue target from $65 billion to at least $66 billion for FY26, while at the same time, we are focused on the bottom line and remain committed to growing EPS at least 10% in FY26. 42. However, given the strong demand that we've talked about and you've seen from Oracle, we've decided to defer an even higher EPS growth rate near term in order to grow our revenue faster over the next five years. 43. We expect that revenue in fiscal year 2029 will exceed $104 billion. 44. This implies an average revenue growth rate of 16% between FY26 and FY29, while at the same time, we plan to accelerate profitability with the plan to reach the 45% operating margin and to grow EPS greater than 20% in FY 2029.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PARTNER &amp; OPERATIONS STRATEGY, ORACLE CORP: Okay, great. So we just heard from Clay on our business momentum and OCI and our key differentiators that are helping to accelerate our business. Now I want to turn to database and analytics. I want to pick up on the threads from Clay.</p><p>Edward, I'll start with you and our platform services that we've built on OCI. We've taken a different approach as compared to others. Others have approached their services by building on all clouds. Our approach has been an integrated strategy where we build on OCI and deliver via multi-cloud. Why have we taken that different approach and how is that helping our customers?</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF CORPORATE ARCHITECT, ORACLE CORP: Well, first of all, it's very important that our platform services like database be available to our customers, no matter which clouds they're choosing for the rest of their application stack. Now, as you point out, I mean, one way to do that would be we could just try to take some Oracle database and HeatWave and port it to every other cloud and try to make it run well there.</p><p>But the problem is we would try to make it run well there. Because we're building on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our own cloud and cloud regions that we attach to the cloud, we can take advantage of a combined engineering between that physical infrastructure and the virtualization software that's running on top of it and the database to offer on top of it, whether it's Oracle database or HeatWave. So at the end, our customers get a service, which is faster and far more functional and far more secure.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Great. And we offer flexibility across deployment options. We have six deployment options. It really enables us to be everywhere. Juan, I have a question for you, which is around our ubiquity. How is it not only enabling us to maintain our database, our customers, but also accelerating the adoption of our unique capabilities like Autonomous?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, MISSION-CRITICAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES, ORACLE CORP: Yeah, so that's pretty straightforward. One of the main reasons our customers come to our cloud is because we're running Oracle database, the full Oracle database, including our Exadata platform, which is what 90% of the largest companies in the world are already running on-prem and what they rely on. So having that available in all these clouds actually obviously makes it possible for our customers to adopt the cloud platform.</p><p>So yes, we also have it on dedicated regions. We can provide it in clouded customer. We can provide them on Exadata, on-prem. So yeah, it's all there. It's back to our roots and database, we're everywhere. So that was one of the original roots of Oracle. It's available everywhere, everybody wants it. We're back to that, very unique. This is a huge year for us in this respect.</p><p>So yeah, so it's very straightforward. And the other thing as Clay mentioned, is true, which is this is the premier platform that all the big financial institutions, telecoms, retailers, everything, I've been talking all week, my voice, it seems like it is starting to run out, but this is it. And we're putting that exact platform, everything, and everything we've built in the cloud for the last eight or so years, Autonomous database, we've put a huge engineering effort into building that. It was exclusively in OCI, now it's in all the major clouds. So it's a huge deal.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: So we're meeting our customers wherever they are. We're making it easier for them to move to the cloud and take advantage of the unique capabilities that the cloud offers. I want to switch over to 23ai, which our team has been building on. Can you talk about the unique value that we're delivering with 23ai? And why are we so confident that our customers are going to upgrade to 23ai?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: Yeah. So that's another very good point. So this is a very big year for database. And we talked about the first thing, which is we're everywhere now, we're in all the clouds. That's a huge deal. The second big, huge deal in May, we released our latest major version of Oracle database that's called Database 23ai. So that's something where we've been working for a lot of major architectural innovations in that release, some of the stuff we've been working on for like six or seven years, it's been kind of baking, baking, baking, and it's finally come out and there's three main focuses there.</p><p>Number one AI, AI is huge, I don't have to explain that to everyone, AI is huge. Second was we put a huge effort into developers, a lot of innovative new development technology, and then our traditional mission-critical, a lot of new developments in mission-critical technology.</p><p>So we've baked AI, things like vector search, natural language query, natural language search into the Oracle database. We've adapted the Oracle database to make it friendly toward AI. So there's AI in the database, but we've also changed the structure of Oracle, so that generative AI -- basically it's easier for it to generate code for Oracle database.</p><p>So those are both very big things. In developers, we unified the major data models that the developers have been using, the Document JSON relational model, the graph model, and the relational model. No one's ever done this before. This is the big breakthrough in data management that no one else has. So that was a major effort that we've had going on for several years. And there's also many, many enhancements on the mission-critical side.</p><p>Big one we talked about Exadata. Exadata has really been for large customers, large enterprises. We have a new technology called Exascale, which is kind of a software reengineering of the way Exadata work. It scales even higher, but more importantly, it scales down.</p><p>So now even a tiny little customer, the minimum size now for running Exadata is two course. So even the tiniest customers now can get the benefits of Exadata. And the thing I say is you can get stock exchange-level performance, availability, security, even if you're the smallest customer. So again, that's very unique.</p><p>We're bringing our super enterprise technology, downscaling at the midrange, even low end customers. We have our global distributed database. Clay mentioned that it allows customers to distribute their data anywhere they want around the world. This is huge for data sovereignty, more and more countries are passing laws that data has to be local. I could go on, but I'm going to stop, right, there's so much technology. So this is a huge year for those two reasons for database.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: And why are we so confident our customers are going to make the upgrade and that it's going to continue to accelerate our business momentum?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: Yeah. So because this technology we've developed are really powerful technologies. And the one thing I would say is the AI technologies, we're helped by the fact that there's so much AI stuff going on in the market, but we our pre-release program for the AI technology is the biggest that we've ever had. We have more interest than that. And the reason people like it is they can say, hey, I want to -- I need to adopt AI, I know I got to do is to stay competitive. And what we're allowing to do is to say, hey, you can take these AI technologies and just put them in your existing mission-critical database, you don't have to change anything.</p><p>It's just a new kind of query, a new kind of data type, and every feature, all the availability, security, scalability, all that stuff because it's just a feature of Oracle database, everything that we built for the last 40 years, it works with the AI technology. So it's instantly mission-critical. So you can deploy it for anything and that that is really a big deal for customers because they want to go quickly. They have directives from their CEO, from their Board, we got to do AI and how do you do AI for mission-critical systems? Well, if you can just drop it in the Oracle database, that's the fastest, easiest, safest path to do AI.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: This is great. So we're meeting our customers wherever they are. We're enabling them to move to cloud faster. We're enabling them to adopt AI more quickly. Edward, I want to come back to you and ask you the Oracle database is just one of the services that we offer. We also have MySQL, HeatWave, and other power services. Can you talk about the unique value that those offer and how does that translate into our business momentum accelerating?</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN: Yeah, I mean, of course, a lot of -- especially, lot of our cloud-native customers, they know they've chosen to use MySQL as their transaction store. And MySQl, HeatWave is combined. MySQL base online transaction processing with extremely high performance, highly scalable, in-memory analytics.</p><p>And in a lot of ways if you look at what we do at Oracle database, you look at what we do in HeatWave, we sort of have a have a build it in philosophy, right? I mean, we have an amazing range of capabilities that are part of 23ai, right. And in the same way and HeatWave, we took that base highly scalable and their analytics, and we put on top of it, something we call auto ML, so automatic machine learning.</p><p>We let customers who basically they don't have to know anything really about data science in order to build regression models, classification systems, you know, recommender systems, anomaly detection. We added on top of that something called lake house. So we can perform these extremely high performance in-memory analytic queries, right, just pulling from files that are stored in object store, right?</p><p>And then we also just released genAI capabilities. So now our customers can do very high-performance vector database creation, right integrated with the normal analytic queries. So I can do joins across structure data and similar researchers that are exact, right. I can combine that with results from auto ML for doing something like anomaly detection. And then I can feed all of that into large language models for generation and just to make sure that our customers have it all built in, we actually have an LLM that's built right into HeatWave.</p><p>We're just trying to make it as simple as possible for customers to do extremely sophisticated data analytics, right at extremely high speed across a wide range of scale. So everything from a single node all the way up to 512 node.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: And before I turn to TK to dive more into data and analytics, I just want to ask Juan, Edward, is there anything else that you think we should highlight for the audience here today that's helping us to continue to deepen and expand our relationships, especially with our enterprise customers?</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN: Well, I think, enterprise customers like performance and low-cost like everyone else. But one thing I think that's especially critical is security, right, security that you can achieve in a simple way, right? So we've always been very, very focused at Oracle.</p><p>I mean, long before cloud on making sure that we had powerful security features built into our products. When we built our cloud number one priority was keep the data secure, right? And we've built, I think, a comprehensive framework of security features and security enforcement mechanisms that help our customers stay secure.</p><p>Now, if you listen to Larry's keynote, he talked about something called zipper. Zipper is the next stage of world-class security. So imagine being able to write relatively simple expressions declarative rules about who has to have access to what, who may have access to it.</p><p>And the fundamental infrastructure of our cloud network enforces that security, it simply will not permit access to data unless you are supposed to get it and that zipper security screen is it's in force at the network level, but understood by Oracle database, HeatWave, and other data source. And I think that is very appealing to enterprise customers. I don't think there's a sophisticated enterprise customer out there who believes that they can do a good job of securing their own infrastructure. They just don't. They know they can't. And the only parties who can do it are cloud vendors and the cloud who do it best is definitely us.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Thank you. Juan, anything before I turn to TK?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: I could go on but let me just add the zipper thing. Zipper is very cool technology, very unique thing I really like about it is it puts the security all the way through the stack in the network and the database all the way across the network.</p><p>So you can say, hey, this is a, let's say, a support analyst or something. And that knowledge goes all the way through the stack, through the application tier. So it knows your support as what can you do, what can't you do. It goes into the databases that, hey, you don't have access to credit card information because you are a support analyst. So it's all the way through the stack, which is something that's been missing because we've had these isolated levels of security without the integration across all the stack.</p><p>So this is really kind of breakthrough technology and it's going to be very, very interesting to customers. Security comes up all the time. I mean, you see what happens when there's a breach in any enterprise. It's a horrific kind of situation where I mean, I've gotten, I think, five letters myself about data breaches. Oh, yeah, we lost all your data. So, you know, this is not good.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Absolutely, not good. I want to turn now to data and analytics. Obviously, our customers are looking to maximize the power of their TK. So can you explain how is Oracle uniquely positioned to help our customers unlock the power of their data, but really maximize the potential of it?</p><p>TK ANAND, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, ANALYTICS, ORACLE CORP: Yeah, I mean, obviously, Oracle is a custodian of so much of our customers' valuable data, the data in our databases, MySQL databases, Oracle applications in the cloud, on-premises, so it's just natural that they come, look to Oracle to help them get value out of all of this data. And in OCI, I think we have an amazing comprehensive suite of data intelligence services that help them extract value from the data.</p><p>First and foremost, with Autonomous data warehouse, which is one of the flavors of Autonomous database and HeatWave, we have two of the industry-leading analytical database engines. These are the engines that can help really analyzed and go through all of your data and extract insights and all that.</p><p>We have a great foundation, unique differentiator with that, right. And of course, now it's available in other clouds as well. Many customers want to also leverage open-source technologies like Spark to be able to do data science and other workloads. So we have an intelligent data lake service that we're offering in OCI. That helps bring those capabilities as well.</p><p>And Oracle Analytics Cloud, which is our visual interactive analytics offering is another capability that has been growing rapidly over the past few years. Recently at the Gartner Data Analytics Summit, we had this thing called the BI Bake Off, where we had a large audience and the three vendors -- we were one of the three vendors alongside Microsoft and Tableau up on stage.</p><p>And we had like a bake-off among the three of us and the audience rated us the best. And so we had -- that's another piece of the strategy. And then, of course, we have a growing suite of AI and data science services in OCI. So we're integrating all of these together into a more cohesive experience for our customers.</p><p>The world of data and analytics is sort of converging. Customers want a simple, integrated experience across data lakes and data warehouses and visual analytics and AI. And that's kind of what we're doing in OCI. But the nice thing about analytics that the approach we've taken is it's also a multi-cloud approach. We recognize that our customers also have data in other clouds.</p><p>So we can go reach data wherever it is. So for example, our Oracle Analytics offerings can go allow customers to go visualize an extra data in an Oracle database, also relate that with data, let's say, in Google, BigQuery, or Snowflake. So we are open also in that nature.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: So the concept of being open extends also to data and analytics.</p><p>TK ANAND: Absolutely.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: That's great. So now I want to talk another unique feature of Oracle is our breadth and our depth and the fact that we have an integrated product portfolio. So TK, can you explain how you're integrating our analytics directly into the applications our customers use day-to-day, whether it's for the front office activities, back-office industry. Can you talk about that a little bit?</p><p>TK ANAND: Yeah. I mean, this is what actually gets me super excited because this is the unique differentiator that Oracle has that no other vendor has. I mean, you all know and Larry often talks about the thing that makes Oracle Cloud unique is we have amazing cloud infrastructure and databases and so forth. And we have amazing suite of applications that leverage that infrastructure and make the infrastructure better.</p><p>Well, that same principle applies to analytics and data intelligence as well. So we have a rich suite of horizontal applications with Fusion and NetSuite. We've got industry vertical applications like healthcare, life sciences, financial services, et cetera. And Oracle have deep understanding of all of the data within these applications. They're not just bits and bytes to us. They're actually entities like customers, products, patients, and we understand what the data means. We also understand what sorts of insights that customers are looking to get out of these data.</p><p>We also know what are the types of intelligent decisions and actions that they want to take based on whether there's an adverse event that they want to react to and so forth. So what we've done is we've built a suite of data intelligence applications. We have something called Fusion data intelligence for our Fusion apps. We have something similar for NetSuite. We have health data intelligence for Oracle health customers.</p><p>We're also working on other industries. We at CloudWorld a couple of days back, we announced the energy and water data intelligence application for our utilities customers. I'm going to keep going because as a data geek like I just love the fact that we have access to all this amazing data across horizontal and vertical domains.</p><p>And then we're offering SaaS analytics, we take all of that data, we massage it, we get it ready for analytics. We give customers prebuilt analytics, infused with AI, and best of all, we connect the Insight back into the applications.</p><p>Ultimately, that's what customers want. Customers are like, yeah, I can use all sorts of analytics and business intelligence tools to go look at data and analyze and explore it. And then it's left as an IQ test to the user to go figure out, okay, how do those go improve my business? Why don't you just help me do that? And that's kind of what we're doing.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Actually at Oracle, we're obviously a customer of your technologies. One of the ways we use it is to help us ensure that we can drive the productivity of our sales reps. Can you explain some of the ways our customers are using the analytics day-to-day?</p><p>TK ANAND: Yeah. I mean, like I'll give you an example in the case of healthcare, right? Like, so our health data intelligence offering is being used by healthcare customers. There are a mix of Cerner as well as even Epic customers, right? They really appreciate the fact that we can bring all of -- I mean, healthcare is just a space direct line which is just so ripe for disruption through analytics.</p><p>We're able to bring data from all of the different hospitals, healthcare providers, payers, and so forth. And we're able to bring a unified notion of a patient's health history. And we use that to offer healthcare providers to kind of manage their patient population as a whole, understand what are the sort of trends that are happening, more and more in the health care industry, they're moving to a value-based care model.</p><p>So providers are being asked to measure themselves in terms of how they're improving the healthcare of the population as a whole as opposed to just getting paid for services. So that's something that we are helping and also that's possible because we have deep intelligence about all of this happening the systems. We also do things like point of care solutions like a patient walking right up to a doctor for an appointment and we can give all the intelligence to a doctor about what is the history, the recent history with that patient? What are some of the preventive action that can be taken.</p><p>This is just one example. We have similar solutions for finance, HR, all sorts of other domains. And again, because we're the custodians of business data for our customers, we can provide these deep solutions.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Right. And a key theme across all the use case is that they are enabling whoever it is to be more productive, be more efficient, and drive the best outcomes.</p><p>TK ANAND: Absolutely. We're not just giving our customers a data platform, say you can go put all your data and they run really super-fast queries. And then it's up to you what do you do with the data, we're actually turning it into a complete finished solution. And that's something that only Oracle can do because we have the platform, thanks to our amazing database technology, but we also have our applications and the domain knowledge.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Very unique. Juan, I want to come back to you because we've talked a lot about how we're expanding our reach and deepening our relationships with enterprise customers, but you also mentioned developers. Can you expand on that a little bit more? How are we continuing to expand our reach in the development community?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: Yeah. So that's one of our main focuses for our next release -- current release, actually, I keep thinking of the next release. We released back in May, hit production, so our Oracle Database 23, I mentioned, I think the biggest thing of this model change is model changes don't happen very often in data management. This whole unifying the document graph and relational model is a huge deal.</p><p>Another really big deal is our APEX development tool. We've been working on that for 20 years, and we're starting to build all our major apps on that. So this is -- you generate the app, okay. So instead of writing lots of code, you can get apps built like 10 times faster because you're visually creating the app and now we put AI into that, so we can use generative AI to make it even better. So that's a big focus of us up the stack.</p><p>So I think there's a lot of other stuff. For example, with the JavaScript directly on database, the world's most popular programming language, there's all sorts of other stuff that we've done. But I think those are two really, really big deals. We think we have the best platform for developing enterprise apps with APEX and this new data model in the Oracle database.</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN: Yeah, actually, just to add one thing to that, Juan. I mean, the APEX Application Express, I mean, it lets you build the application very quickly, as Juan described. But when the application is running there because it's being completely run inside the database, right, it's the database serve as the autonomous database, which is, which is managing the application.</p><p>There's no separate tier of the application that the customer then has to be responsible for or thinking about scaling or pay for separately in any way. It's all built in. And I think that that's probably honestly in many ways, at least as appealing as there's the ease of development.</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: Yeah, ease of development, and I think the other thing is it's enterprise ready. You can build the world's biggest most complex app and it's not a toy, little development where you do this little thing on the site. This is like world's biggest, most complex application.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Right. As you mentioned, we're using APEX to build our own application.</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN: Pretty much every new application is built on not only externally, but for ourselves internally is built on Application Express.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: So before we close, are there any interesting customer examples that any of you want to share that would help demonstrate the unique value we're delivering?</p><p>EDWARD SCREVEN: I think one customer, very excited to see, there's a company called [EEZ]. You think of it as kind of like the UberEATS of Latin America. I mean, they use HeatWave and they use a combination of the automatic machine learning that's built into HeatWave plus the genAI to do the following.</p><p>So when you go and you place your order or you're thinking about placing an order, they use auto ML to generate a recommender model, right, which then based on your past history comes up with a list of recommendations, they feed that list of recommendations into genAI to give you a natural language description of what they want to suggest you to order, right?</p><p>And if you look at their application, the total amount of code they'd have write to do that auto ML work, the recommender engine, the genAI, it's almost nothing, right. I mean, if you look at the source code for these applications, it's very, very small.</p><p>And I think that's something which they weren't ML experts in anyway, right? They didn't know anything about recommender systems. They didn't know anything about genAI yet they're able to build this very powerful application because of what we've built into that data store.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: We're enabling our customers to do so much in a much easier way, even if they don't have the knowledge. Any others that Juan or TK that you want to highlight?</p><p>TK ANAND: I'll take one from again from healthcare. And this one. I love this example, it's advocate Atrium Health, which is a pretty big healthcare network. They love the integrated end-to-end offering that we have with health intelligence, with the analytics, and the closed-loop action.</p><p>But their entire -- they'd run Epic pretty much exclusively for their EHR right now. We'd love for them to move to Cerner, but they love our analytics, so much so that -- and because we operate just like we're multi-cloud. We're also interoperable with all sorts of healthcare systems, so we've integrated well with the Epic systems. So they're very happy to work with us with data intelligence and analytics that interoperates very well with Epic with their EHR. I find that a pretty powerful statement.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: Great. Open as a team. And Juan, should we close with another example?</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA: Yeah, so we released our latest release just in May. So actually, we had a number of customer presentations here at CloudWorld and you saw some really big financial firms, retail firms, entertainment firms that are already adopting the AI technology in Oracle database.</p><p>So we had a number of these customer panels. I've never seen adoption this fast. I mean, this is an enterprise database, and it's been what, three months, maybe 3.5 months. And we already have customers here talking about how they're using this stuff. And the reason for that is it's so easy.</p><p>We've baked it into the Oracle datastore. So like a six line SQL statement, you can combine all your business data and AI together and do amazing stuff that was never possible before. So this technology is super easy to adopt. And so that's what a lot of people like, oh, I learned this in an hour.</p><p>It used to be always AI stuff. You basically had to go to school to get a data science degree. Now we have just regular Oracle database developers just cranking this stuff out. So it's very easy. And yeah, it's fantastic. We had a lot of customers showing what they were doing already here at CloudWorld.</p><p>LEAH YOMTOVIAN: That's great. Thank you so much. So much easier, we're expanding our reach, we are open. TK, Juan, Edward, I'm now going to let you guys go and we're going to switch from database and analytics and we're going to switch over to talk about applications.</p><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p><p>SAFRA CATZ, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, DIRECTOR, ORACLE CORP: Thank you. I don't know if you have any questions left, and I know a lot of you have flights, so we'll make this quick. Who's got a question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Hey, Safra. Thank you so much for a great week, lot of excitement. It's palpable walking the show floor talking to customers and partners. It seems like it hasn't been this exciting to be at Oracle for some I wanted to ask you about the fantastic guidance that you've provided today and that Doug went over with us.</p><p>Can you maybe just talk a little bit about obviously you're not going to box yourself into a corner. You tell us line by line exactly how you get there. There are many ways I'm sure that you can win. But as we think about the leverage in the business, both gross margin and OpEx efficiency.</p><p>On the way to 2019, you just talk a little bit more about there's multiple ways to win here Thank you.</p><p>SAFRA CATZ: Yeah. So we have a number of ways to get there and come. The reality is, first of all, you can see already in our remaining performance obligations, we have enormous norm, enormous amount of business coming our way, and this is only the beginning.</p><p>So there's the OCI layer. The GPU business is part of that. The other part of it, of course, is the database business. And what's wonderful about the database business, especially in our multi-cloud approach is that that is a high-margin business because it's an extremely high value business.</p><p>And if you've been listening to my calls and for you, you have been you know that we talked about three legs to the stool Fusion, Net suite and our vertical applications. It's already a big number. Larry, just told to Cerner, as you know, as I was breaking down over our first two years, Cerner is actually a drag currently. It's going to turn around and be like a neutral because and then it's going to be truly additive.</p><p>And when I say neutral, I only mean that it won't be shrinking, but it may not be growing as fast at least the 1st year as Fusion the next wave. And then on and then all of our other industry applications, they are only now coming online into the cloud. So those numbers are going to be very helpful.</p><p>So there's OCI and the GPU business, which is the GPU business, only a subset of OCI generally and then the application and now the database and sort of everything is hitting and the databases just started, even though like for other people, it would be a complete company. But for us compared to everything else, it is just moving to the cloud.</p><p>And we've given ourselves a couple of years and basically, everything is happening and you know bunch of other things, but I'm not going to share with you now that we are just starting that there's just now you'll start to see little hints of it over this next two year lines of businesses that you might have heard us talk about transactions and things like that, other capabilities that we've not even hinted at all of those are going to start showing up over the next few years.</p><p>Of course, we're not going to leave our historic disciplines. We treat this money like it's our money. It's not necessarily your money. We treat it like it's actually our money. And so we're always extremely careful about matching up what we do without giving up profitability. And you know the thing that's most interesting is not even over $100 billion number, but the 20% EPS growth, you know, I remember last time we talked about that and we delivered this and then we did our transitions.</p><p>Every single thing we said would happen over these years has happened. We do not remember those of you who've been with us this whole time who I say have had an understanding and faith in our ability to ultimately execute this and the success has been. So we are a result of some of the things that Larry shared in his original keynote that he shared here that the technical teams shared, we have extremely differentiated product.</p><p>We're not a me-too operation, you know, like oh they're doing this us to know that's not our way always do the higher-value things, do it faster, cheaper and more securely, those numbers should not be a problem.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thanks, Safra. As part of this new framework, how do us to think about a CapEx spending and one of the things that could be interesting is like if you sit in Azure, if you sit in GCP and AWS, they won't spend a lot of money for you in MA, but like how do we have to think more broadly from a broader picture perspective out this supporting numbers on cash and CapEx? Thank you.</p><p>SAFRA CATZ: Well, you know, I don't want to say this, so I'm just not, but I worry about CapEx. Okay. And I figure out how to maximize the power of every CapEx dollar. So we are very, very careful to trying to leverage every dollar and to also ride the coattails of richer companies who want to give us floor space and power. That's zero CapEx for me.</p><p>Okay. And all I do is put in my computers and when it's got for space and power, you know, my contribution CapEx-wise is very, very small. Additionally, there are all sorts of other clever ways to leverage other people's spending on your behalf and on to make sure that we've got some new exactly a nicely aligned spending model.</p><p>We will be spending more. There's no question, but we're always looking at clever ways to make our cash go further. And you know, sometimes as I've told you on different earnings calls, sometimes you know the difference between it in one quarter and another you should not break your heads on that. You need to kind of look at it in a backwards 12 months or a forward 12 months because we see in any one quarter.</p><p>And I think I gave an example even on the earnings call, though, I feel like I've been talking so long. I can't tell what I where I said it, but sometimes the components come to us. And when we buy them, they are capital spend, but sometimes they actually don't come to us. They go to our one of our manufacturers and I don't buy it until another quarter. You know, three weeks later in a computer and you'd be like, oh, wow, look at that $400 million, you know, why didn't you spend it because I'm spending it through, you know, 10 days from now. So don't worry about that. I've told you we're going to double our CapEx, believe me.</p><p>And of course, you'll see the revenue, the revenues right there, dumb and so double this year, not giving guidance on next year yet, but we'll get there soon enough.</p><p>SITI PANIGRAHI, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES: Hi, Safra. Siti Panigrahi, Mizuho.</p><p>The topic this week is all about multi-cloud, and it's very impressive to see this three partnership in just one year. So we know that that's going to unlock a lot of value for your legacy customer database customer. So how should we think about the contribution of that this partner sales going forward?</p><p>SAFRA CATZ: Well once they get really rolling. It's going to be, I think, quite significant if you want to know the tourists and it's going to be very, very profitable for us.</p><p>I want to make one other point, though, you should understand that in this kind of multi-cloud world, it's not only them. It's an ROI that I think was on stage here. Just a little while ago, it's Saudi Telecom, all of these alloy partners. So have our cloud completely embedded on their floor space, fully plugged in.</p><p>But you are nowhere else, Siti, you know, at a bank. They have the full plan out when they have what we call a dedicated region cloud customer. They have it is literally a region. It just sits on their floor or whatever floor they told us to go to and it's just there.</p><p>So you need to understand that as my you know, Amazon is going to be a wide-open. Azure is already in action. Google went live during the show if this is this is a big part of it. But you also if you're hearing me on the calls, you hear me talk about consumption revenues going way up.</p><p>Well, remember, we have planted in on a big map, but we've also planted customer sets and they as those fill up that money, we spent a while ago, the JWCC, for example, many of you don't know what that is member. There was supposedly jet I project for the Department of Defense. Remember it was cancelled. It was a single source to one of these guys. It was cancelled, instead it was the MJWCC. We are the ones because the single largest task order about a week and a half ago.</p><p>Remember, you have to understand that data centers fully built out to federal standards, accredited certified and everything. It's been ready for a while we got the single largest task order.</p><p>Okay. So you have a so this is just happening. There's a lot out there and there's a lot going on. Honestly, it is and everywhere we go. I want you to remember one thing, Everything Everywhere. So at Azure, it's our service. They're available. They may not have been turned on. They look exactly the same. And if customers want them turned on, you know it, Azure at Google and then ultimately at AWS. And those folks at Microsoft have been rolling out services on OC this whole time that they're actually all fabulous.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. We'll take one last question is I know people have planes to make and we're wanting to keep on time.</p><p>JOHN DIFUCCI, ANALYST, GUGGENHEIM SECURITIES LLC: Hi, Safra. John DiFucci, Guggenheim.</p><p>So I want to come back to the database migration to the cloud because this is something I've been reading about for years and it's been hard because it just makes total sense, but the timing has been tough and it makes sense. Larry talked about these being mission, critical workloads are really important. So it makes sense that the sort of the last things to move them out or when you're confident about the cloud, I've never lost faith in this. But unlike Brad And [Raymo] And Carl, but, look at you the what gives you the confidence today that now it's about to happen is that you actually see it in CRPO and RPO are those are they contracted for now as part of that, like you see that momentum in addition to if you want to talk a little bit about why not?</p><p>SAFRA CATZ: Sure, and I actually had it on stage with me that even know my customers, they all the different days when your BNP Paribas and you take all your day, but you know your Oracle databases and you put them in our cloud, it's starting German banks more and more is just the it's scary, it's slow, it's your company's heart and you're thinking yourself.</p><p>Oh, my gosh, you know, is this one and am I really ready to put it in the cloud, now It's happening. In fact, it's interesting because our multi-cloud strategy, which is not only being in the other hyperscalers, but allowing these customers to have their own region where they don't have to share with anybody. It feels to them like the safety of on-premise with all modern capabilities, they can go downstairs for level down into their basement and be like it's here and yet it is in the cloud and they have all the services. They want they are completely up to date by the way you one of you asked a question of Larry about United, I think who are the guys that aren't going to survive this.</p><p>I'll tell you who folks who say there's cloud, but are actually just hosted, okay, applications where you get a new update every three years instead of every 90 days, those folks that game. It's like game on now in applications, all these new modules, all these new agents, if you're pretending to be cloud by just putting yourself in one of these hyperscalers building.</p><p>That's not actually cloud, cloud is new capabilities, exactly the same code everywhere and new abilities and capabilities every 90 days. And so this is going to be a very exciting time for us at Oracle, you can tell.</p><p>I must say the funniest, Greg I heard and it kind of goes against our whole messaging was one of our customers stood up at an event like in this room and she said it or he said, we're not multi-cloud. We're only OCI and we're thrilled, you know, so and we embrace, but we also embrace all the choice. And this is a really exciting time to be with us. I have to say one of my customers in our public sector in a public sector meeting, I stood up the city of Atlanta.</p><p>They went big bang, Oracle Fusion, Big Bang, Oracle Fusion of all the applications. And they just couldn't wait to talk about it. So and with all our other customers, I hope that you all have gotten to see and hear from our customers, you shouldn't have to believe us, of course, please believe our financial statements not only announced on game nine, but the que was filed overnight.</p><p>I want to thank you all. We do really appreciate your support. We've been working hard on this. I can tell you what Larry and I are talking about, we're talking about how exciting the next 10 years are going to be at Oracle. So you should you should keep an eye on this. We're having a lot of fun.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Please welcome Larry Ellison at this stage.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON, CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, FOUNDER, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, ORACLE CORP: Did he say $104 billion, that's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy.</p><p>BRAD ZELNICK, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Okay. Hey, thanks very much, Larry.</p><p>Brad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.</p><p>Great to see you. Larry you've been in software industry for over 50 years, use thrive through multiple paradigm shifts ahead of us. We've got a major opportunity that Oracle and many others are racing fast and investing very much in what is it that supports your confidence that this is good for the industry of software and there may not be a redistribution of value, I don't know, maybe to semiconductors or elsewhere along the [Tecstar].</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Well, no, actually, I'm going to sit down again now. I'll just stand up for questions of the really interesting thing about AI and again, as I used to give this speech a long time ago when I was a kid, if you really want to understand the computer industry, you really have to study the industry that it's most like, which is a women's fashion industry and you need to start reading W magazine because they tell you what's hot and what's not.</p><p>And the focus on AI mean, we're very good at the AI stuff, but you know, you really can't train AI systems without data a lot of companies are very excited about going ahead and exploiting artificial intelligence. And an awful lot of those models are being built at Oracle because we happen to have really interesting networking technology in our data center that allows you to build huge clusters by the way that we first built for our database a long time ago.</p><p>And then when we brought our database to the cloud. We built very unusual cloud data centers with these very fast RDMA networks. And that's what made it is relatively straightforward for us to build very fast GPU clusters using and video chips where we can go to 32,000 in a huge clusters, give you terrific performance because the problem is not just processing the data and training is also moving the data entered into the cluster, and we're good at that.</p><p>But how go think about this idea of? Yes, we're really good at AI and training AI systems, but we have this franchise where most of the world's important data is in an Oracle database. And I think the market for a long time, I've kind of chatted with you guys. And sometimes you have competence and things that we're doing and sometimes less confidence and things that we're doing. And I think maybe we go back three years ago, have something like that.</p><p>And I think you guys were pretty confident that we're doing well in SAP. We've kind of proven our self with Fusion and then the acquisition of NET suite. We were a solid SaaS player and we were going to be a solid SaaS player. I think the jury was I'll just say the jury was out for OCI for us becoming a cloud competitor.</p><p>But what we had made our name on the technology that we had pioneered relational database technology, I think most people thought we were going to lose that franchise. The only probably only been that kept us from losing because we had Oracle only at OCI, we didn't have it at Google and Amazon and AWS, we had a huge amount on premise, a lot of our customers. I didn't move those applications to the cloud, but I think there was a lot of [skepticism], whether we move all of that information to the cloud. And in fact, no one else invested in database during that period of time.</p><p>What is the real? Is it Snowflake? Is it Mongo? What is it?</p><p>Well, I think people talking database isn't really very interesting speech W magazine AI's hot databases, not which is really interesting because I mean, I think it's still called the information age. And unless you have your data properly organized, you can't use AI, it becomes utterly useless. This is enormously powerful tool and it has doesn't have access to a really coherent access to your data so you can't exploit it.</p><p>So if you want to take advantage of AI know you have to do two things. You have to really do a good job of organizing your existing data and making it accessible. And then you have to have the appropriate AI tools, whether they're large language models or other sorts of neural networks, depending on whether you're doing some of the things we're doing with two things we're doing in healthcare.</p><p>One is which we're creating it automatically using a large language model to create doctors' notes that we will if we listened to a consultation between doctor and patient, we create and elsewhere, large language model do that. We look at a biopsy slide, very different neuron that we use a very different neural network, still look at a biopsy slide and say, well, do we think there's cancer.</p><p>So there's those are very different that you have to have the training data apparel, the biopsy slides you have you have to have all the medical records accessible the hospital does the clinics do government payers, the insurance companies do the National Health Service in UK that they have to organize all of that data, all that Alberta coherently.</p><p>So it's really a two-part pronged problem. When you say I really want to use AI and take full advantage of AI. Well, you can't do it unless you get you that data in order for both training and inferencing. And there isn't no alternative to the Oracle database that I know of I would love. I think Microsoft Sequel Server is not a bad product maybe it's the second best relational database out there since IBM got out of the relational, I mean, kind of got out of the business, Amazon who a valued.</p><p>And I think there is an incredible company, AWS, incredible service, but they really don't build databases. They took over. They take open-source products and they put them in their cloud. We don't do a lot of database R&amp;D, we do almost none and Google has Big Query, but it's really not a database. So why am I confident that in the future is bright. And I slightly rephrase your question, you're saying, why am I not worry that a?</p><p>I will suddenly go out of fashion and something the next hot thing will come up and then we're kind of now?</p><p>Well, we're certainly that's a wholesale dependent on AI and we've got nothing else supporting our hopefully very attract, very big stock price, right? And so that's supporting our growth our EPS growth, our revenue growth and making our business better.</p><p>Well, I think we have multiple ways to take advantage of the information age, take advantage of AI part of it is SAP are doing a really good job with that database business holding onto that franchise.</p><p>And if you think about us holding onto that franchise, what's that work in the era of cloud. It was worth quite a bit back when everything was on premise. Everyone built around data centers. But in the AI world where data is an essential enabler, we have the best, the best database and it remain it becomes more popular than ever. I think that's an important pillar to our future.</p><p>And it's important part of the value that we give we provide to customers. Our databases don't get hacked. They don't get hacked. Lots of lots of really famous companies get hacked. We don't highly secure. We pay a lot of attention to security. We think we have huge differentiation on security and reliability, our database. What are the unique things about Oracle is going to walk up it will.</p><p>Yeah, I shouldn't walking out walk-up of the gun and start shooting our servers. But all this, everything would keep running. We're the only database that can take multiple computers and high speed network them together and create the illusion. It's really one computer. We run one workload on 64, if you will, say, 64 servers with this high-speed RDMA network, interconnecting them and I can just start shooting 20 of them and the system will keep running.</p><p>No one else has anything like that? No one else had that kind of scale. It's called RAPIDS called Real Application Clusters. We had it for a long time, you know, who else has got it now a decade or so later two decades later no one else has it. Now nobody we're the only ones that could provide that kind of reliability. We're the only ones that we can scale and they put up with nothing in security with we're doing getting rid of passwords and we talked about what a wonderful video, a buyout biometric authentication and Google Pay Apple Pay, which is kind of the beginning of biometric authentication for credit and we can spread it all get any card, MasterCard, Visa, American Express.</p><p>We can make it work with the biometric database all over the world that are going to need to be able to 22,000 transactions per second to validate those rather not a problem, not even close to a problem, but nobody else can do it, and that's one run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Never not get half, never, never not a problem. Well, I can say that interesting.</p><p>So we have a highly differentiated technologies. Our networks are very different than our competitors. The RDMA networks that we build are essential for training, large neural networks, but they're also essential for building this extremely advanced, extremely reliable, highly scalable global databases that we can build and it means we can build systems that don't have to come down.</p><p>We patch our database while it's running. So if you're a phone company be a European company and you're expected provide a service that never goes down, but six of our data centers. And I think that's just the beginning because our database is also faster, which is you say, well, that's great. You go really fast. That's really nice.</p><p>Okay. Let me translate that to a slightly different sitting in the cloud or garden much cheaper, it's much cheaper. And that's why we have an advantage in training AI models because, yes, our networks are faster, which means training happens faster and it costs you less because you charge by the hour. And if we charge half, if we're twice as fast, we charge half as much.</p><p>So I think so let me just I think database is an unbelievable franchise and sustaining it into the cloud era. It's bigger than this business is now everything we evidence more important than everything we do now. So I think the other thing when it when it's fully grown when that business is probably ground, I think on AI is also an astonishing business last night. I had dinner with a friend of mine and my son at Noble and Malibu and Malibu.</p><p>And we were talking about the future of robotics and he's building a bunch of them in Palo Alto. So on it's unbelievable, it's unbelievable what's going on. We'll be training these humanoid robots. I was just discussing with SAP proud of that because of SAP and agricultural save it every ten seconds. I feel like I'm living in a science fiction movie and then we kind of get over it and go back and talk a little more of that business, but we'll be training robots to be nurses.</p><p>So I'm it will be we'll be training robots to do a variety of variety of things in hospital but also nursing nurses and nurses at home. These robots can do they were originally designed to work in factories there, humanized rebates because they'll be doing jobs that were formally done by human beings.</p><p>So you need a robot that's got two arms and two legs and kind of fits into the same spaces and can do the same manipulations that human beings can do so they can work in restaurants, they can work and they can work in hospitals. And we're very involved in automating hospitals and their whole the whole bunch of things that we're going to do in terms of rolling out robotics are in hospitals where we're connecting.</p><p>We're working big German engineering company that makes medical devices is name. I'm not sure I'm allowed to say, but it's really big important German company begins with us, but I can't tell you any more than that. We think all of their diagnostic devices there to tube scanners there of everything. There are x-ray machines, there's underground machinery, machinery, ultrasound machines, all and MRIs.</p><p>Obviously, all of that data all of those machines have to be connected to the Internet. And then they're all part of our big IoT framework. And we're working. We're working with these companies, whether it's bioMerieux on France or the US company in Germany or they have to connect all of these devices to the Internet. And we have we're I think we're better at IoT than anybody because and there is a really interesting reason why rates are going to be about.</p><p>It's over this the only question I'm going to answer over the next hour. I realize I'm going on and on here, maybe with them the question, why are we good at IoT? Because we build applications that make demands on the underlying infrastructure and we eventually get it to our heads exactly what we need to do because we're really doing the applied IoT.</p><p>We actually have to make up the medical devices in the hospital. We've got it. We're using our OREPARFID. track inventory in the hospital. We know we know a lot where the RFID antennas, we know where they go and how much they cost. And we value-engineered because we are actually deliberately we don't I mean, I used to be a problem, an anecdote, real threats.</p><p>I was a programmer of working my way through college and onetime one summer. I got a summer job, anyway, did they have built an application built an application program actually was automating a chicken factory. And I don't know why they gave me their job, but they give me the job and I wrote the application.</p><p>I thought I'd done it perfectly turn it over to them kind of my last day going back, it went back to college and they said that they through the application away because it didn't work in a sequestered naltrexone, you guys make ice cream. I'm a really good programmer. I'm sure it works.</p><p>And so I went in and see what went wrong. Well, they were making chocolate ice cream, but they had run out of chocolate. And I said, you know, there is no way to run make chocolate. We don't have chocolates is chocolate.</p><p>You can't make chocolate ice cream and plus you don't have enough choice. And but you couldn't make chocolate chip ice cream either easier because you had your you only had happened the major outages you needed to make judgments about screen.</p><p>So you made the stuff that I know my system shows, it's impossible to make. So if you're wrong, I'm not wrong. And there's a military. If we run at a chart that we just use cocoa. And if we're missing half the chocolate Choco chips, we just put in half as many.</p><p>BRAD ZELNICK: Why would you ever hire a college student to that program?</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: No, I had no idea, I didn't know. But now because we actually do it. We know we build the IoT framework. We've got a bunch of things where that were, I guess it became way to say it was suboptimal. But as we build one application after another after another on top of that IoT framework, we've gotten really good at is handled one use case and another use case and another use case, and there are lots of days. So we had this unusual structure of the company that we are both a supplier of this foundational technology. You guys call infrastructure.</p><p>And then we are a user of that foundational technologies. We build a variety of applications, audit and build school safety systems, please automation systems, military systems, all sorts of all sorts of applications on top of it. And we thought and we're able then we learn when that learning curve we're able to learn and constantly improve the database, constantly improve our IoT frameworks, constantly improve our network performance and reliability, et cetera.</p><p>And it's that tight loop. I think that gives is one of our secret advantages versus our competitors that we're doing both I'm sorry on the Nets, Andrew will definitely be shorter over time over here.</p><p>JACKSON ADER, ANALYST, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS: Thanks.</p><p>Hey, Larry. Jackson Ader, KeyBanc Capital Markets.</p><p>I think about 2029, what about artificial intelligence has to go right for those targets to be hit and how right does it have to go for those targets to be hit? Thank you.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Okay. I think on the AI mean, how depend on that? Our dependency on AI by 2029, I can guarantee you AI am not going to be the problem because the simple phrase the race goes on, and I mean, this is like Formula one. What do I mean by that?</p><p>Really? No one winner. I mean, you got three people on the podium, but it's really kind of one winter someone's getting better than this than anybody else and multiple people are trying and there is a race if you listen to Jensen Huang, and I'm sure you do I know I know you do because I've seen the stock price and I know, I was at dinner with you on my bill Noble, Palo Alto. I was there with Elon Musk, Jensen Huang, and I went there and I would describe editor is Oracle and millennial on begging Jensen Huang for GPUs.</p><p>Please take our money, please take our money, but we got dinner asynchronous. Please take our money, take no, no, take more, but you know, you're not taking enough that we need you to take more of our money, please.</p><p>I mean we could be yes. I mean, the demand for GPUs, the desire to be first, the desire to build the most capable neural network in the world getting there first is a big deal, whether it's getting there. First and self-driving or getting there for us either first in reading cancer biopsy slides getting their first job in synthesizing video then making movies or I mean, but there's I mean, this impacts.</p><p>So many are doing protein design, build design. I mean, we're very involved in designing both small molecules and protein, much larger molecules, peptides, proteins for cancer therapeutics, designing cancer therapeutics mean being first, it's very important.</p><p>And the guys who are in this race are very smart and the under and they understand they need to be they need to be best at something they like to be first. So if you they're spending a lot of time and a lot of money begging Jensen, we're building data centers. I mean, my God we're building nuclear reactors, you can I mean that sounds completely made up, but it's not that you need a lot of power to power acres of these GP administer acres of these GPU clusters. I'm not sure there's anything like this ever happened before. You know what it would basic stakes is know what it cost to build a frontier model.</p><p>Anyone over that three, three years, how much will be spent if you want to if you're one of the companies that want to build a frontier model, you know material how much we spend anybody anyone want to guess $10 billion, $100 billion? Yeah $100 billion, that's kind of gets you in the game, put down your hundred, the average male gaming you come in is the idea here is my money yet. It's not male is game. It's a bigger game put in your $100 billion and you're in the race, not a lot of people, not a lot of companies, not a lot of countries will participate.</p><p>JACKSON ADER: I'm going to go over here.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: It's over there. So that's good. But it's good for us. It's really good for us. We're going to 29.</p><p>DERRICK WOOD, ANALYST, TD COWEN: Thanks, Larry.</p><p>Derrick Wood, TD Cowen.</p><p>I think a lot of us view Amazon to be a bit of a flow to Oracle, at least in the head and the database business, but they decided to partner with you. Can you just shed some thought on why they want to partner with you. And then even stepping back from that, as you go into this multi-cloud capability, how do you feel about how that helps your ability to gain market share in the database space?</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Well, I think again, we've been a supplier to Amazon. Let's go back to the days before it was AWS with Amazon ran on the Oracle database for very, very, very long time. And I think yet I got kind of cute commenting about, you know, Amazon uses Oracle doesn't use AWS globally now and that hurts and people's feelings I probably shouldn't have said it again. But Amazon, we have a we have a lot of the same customers. I think they're partnering with us because our customers have huge investments in Oracle databases are huge investors and applications built on those Oracle databases and they are, but they also like Amazon.</p><p>So some of those customers want to move some of those applications to Amazon or some of them want to move them to Google some of the money and move them to Microsoft. Some of them wanted to move into Oracle. I mean, you got all of the above are the only way you can do that here are the best to actually take. The very best way to do that is get access to the very latest and greatest Oracle Tech Cloud technology. And we talked about this with Microsoft initially and they said, yes, now that's great with customers, what customers are asking for.</p><p>I've had Amazon customers a very big bank in New York and a very close, a good friend of mine. I mean, even the yell at me, but he said a pretty much a slurry. Would you please make sure Oracle rack and Oracle Autonomous runs at Amazon because we've got a big commitment to Amazon and we're going to move a lot of our apps and not all of our assets, not everything, but I don't think anyone can move every giant money center bank is going to use, move everything to one cloud. I don't think that's going to happen, Mike, on a benefits are going to use multiple facets and But we'd like to use Amazon. That's a great makes sense to me so we did that. We decided no, it was a bit of it's an interesting problem just to do. It is not easy to actually run. I mean, autonomous only runs quite only RET ran the cloud.</p><p>There was never it was never a software license. You can get for the autonomous database. It was always a cloud service. It was born as a cloud service. So how do we take a cloud service out of Oracle and move it into Amazon and Microsoft and Google Data assembly and shipping them some software and saying, okay, run it on your computer. That's not possible. So turned out. The only really the only way we could do it was to embed OCI into Amazon, Google and Microsoft a miniature version of our cloud, not such a miniature version of our cloud that could run all these different databases.</p><p>In fact, run or any of us all of our services to all of our clouds are the same. All of our clouds is another huge difference between us and everybody else. All of our clouds are software, identical. All of our clouds have all of our services period in that way.</p><p>We have one automation system that runs all of our clouds. If we make all the other clouds, the cloud slightly different. We can automate. But anyway, that's step one. Step one was we got it. We got now we've got to shrink our data centers down small enough that we can because we can can't build 50 huge data centers inside of Amazon on day one because they need them in several different locations than even in several different countries.</p><p>And so we got to have some way to embed an Oracle data center and Amazon, Google and Microsoft back and that many of them and many different locations and do it in an economic way. And we made our data centers are scalable, meaning you can have a starter data center today, which is about 150 kilowatts.</p><p>And then you just keep adding more and more racks as you get more and more customers being get the full Oracle, the full Oracle Data Cloud data center at 130 kilowatts. I mean this is I don't think any of our competitors are our 20 are that's 5% of your 5% is a conservative number, meaning I don't think they can do it 20 times larger their data centers are 10 times larger than our smallest data center that we can put in.</p><p>So we were able to actually then start with a bunch of small data centers in Microsoft and as they have. But and as they add database customers and they'll add Oracle services customers, we can make those data centers bigger and bigger and bigger and we develop that strategy a long time ago because we wanted to put Oracle data centers in every major city in the world and every pretty much every country in the world included. We want to put Oracle data centers complete cloud by design, meaning a complete cloud on a submarine or aircraft carrier.</p><p>We certainly get an aircraft carrier, no problem submarine a little trickier on the So that's another thing we had problem we had to solve to meet the customer requirement. I want to run Oracle Autonomous Database inside of Microsoft Azure well, then we have to embed the Oracle cloud inside of Microsoft.</p><p>As your next question, where is Microsoft Azure? Let me give you a map. And these 60 locations of so you need 60 data centers embedded Oracle data centers embedded in Microsoft Azure. And back to real numbers, we're building about 30. But who knows we might be it might go to 60.</p><p>So we had to solve that problem. But we did and we solve it in a way that has not only allows us to embed these data centers in Microsoft Azure and Google and a submarine do things like that, but we did it with a high degree, allowed us to get a high degree of automation and automation means you're much more reliable because there's no there's no human labor, there's no human error imager a lot more secure because if there's no human labor, there's no human mischief or that exposes security vulnerabilities. And if there's no human labor, what is the cost per hour of no human labor. So our data centers are faster, more secure, more reliable, but you got to be willing to pay less. It sounds impossible, but in fact, it was an essential to solve it.</p><p>We're going to solve the security problem. We have to have an autonomous database and that we have to have autonomous data operating systems. We have to autonomous data centers. They've got to be robotics robots drive cars way better than human beings. They fly airplanes way better than human beings may more consistently made way more reliably.</p><p>And the cost with us gives us a huge competitive advantage. So I think that's another interesting differentiator between us and the competition, we do applications and infrastructure.</p><p>Can you just say what well, that's Larry, you're not focused you're not concentrated on infrastructure like your competitors. Actually, we think building applications just have dramatically improved our infrastructure. We think the customer is demanding that we run in all the different clouds.</p><p>It turned out to be very good for us. And by the way and for Amazon. So Amazon now can satisfy their customers who want to move their Oracle applications to Amazon customers, Amazon is happy our database. They keep using the Oracle database, which is good for us. So we're happy I think it increases the size of the market for us dramatically and our customers have viewed this. It's been very interesting because you know, we debated this a lot inside, okay? What's going to happen when we partner with Microsoft and Amazon and Google, we debate back and forth is it's going to hurt our business, maybe will help the database business, but hurt OCI and how is this all going to play out?</p><p>I think our experience in the IT and please ask that break this up and are the funds that we've spent a lot of clay, we spent a lot of time talking about this work. Of course, we're trying to predict the future, which is dangerous on complex. But I think the customer reaction has been so positive that Oracle is doing this, that customers are very open to saying.</p><p>Okay. Yeah, I'm using AWS. But I'd also like to use OCI, I think you guys are really good at this, and I'm going to I'm going to have to I'm going to have two cloud providers and the ones going to be Amazon one's going to OCI.</p><p>So I think our OCI business has actually been strengthened and you can make it argue you could make the other argument that it would hurt the US business. But I think as it turned out, it turns out the customer dynamics were such that it actually helped our OCI business and is growing our database business. And our OC. business is growing faster than other otherwise would have on the back there.</p><p>KARL KEIRSTEAD, ANALYST, UBS: Hi, Larry.</p><p>Karl Keirstead at UBS.</p><p>I've got a similar question, but rather about Microsoft, it's been extraordinary watching the warming of this relationship between Oracle and Microsoft over the last year. That's interesting enough to me that I'd love to get your perspective. I don't think anybody is shocked that Microsoft would want to historical databases in Azure. You can see how they would benefit from that. What I think is extraordinary is that they be buying so much OCI capacity that is wild a new, give us some context.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Yeah, I think, we're very good at this. I mean, we're really good at this. And Microsoft is making a major play in AI. And I think it's more important if I'm running Microsoft or not, but what is more I want to train. I'd like to see ChatGPT got investment in ChatGPT, Open Eye adjusted EBITDA. I have some my own eye services that I want to provide. If Oracle's cloud can help me speed up the training of ChatGPT. It's good for me. It's good for our risk of Oracle but it's also good for Microsoft.</p><p>I mean, there's no there's really in a way, no, no magic here other than you adapt. What you have to say will Oracle must be pretty good at this as a trend and that Microsoft would actually go ahead and buy it. And I think that's true. I think we are very good at, but Microsoft is looking, I think long term and broadly that they want to make their OI to AI, excuse me or not, OI to AI is as capable and as competitive as they can. And if one, if by using Oracle or Oracle Cloud services helps them achieve that goal. So be it maybe there was it.</p><p>Oh, I wish we could have done it our self, we didn't need Oracle, but if they can help us, let's not lose sight of the goal as we've decided, the goal is for us to be a leader in AI, if they can help us be a leader in AI, let's go work with them. I think you know our training I did with the unless like Amazon and we're training Graco and grow to and doing, it's doing well and on.</p><p>Yeah, I think same thing. I mean, everyone does a lot of things on its own because he's really good engineer a great engineering team is Graham. Brilliant guy does that. But I think when you made the decision on get started quickly, you start training and start training rock. We were the best choice and he chose to work with us, and we're very proud of that. And we think that's a testimony to the quality of our of our offering at OC-A. offerings that OCR and I think the same thing. So the Olympics us and Sokkia Nadella, one working with us, those are all good signs that we have technology that that's valuable and differentiated.</p><p>JOHN DIFUCCI: Hi, Larry. It's John DiFucci, Guggenheim.</p><p>So thank you, you had some very nice things about. Thank you.</p><p>Because you drove that new team. But listen, I really I think a lot of us here really appreciated some of your comments on the call around AI. We hear a lot of people talking about it and how they're going to charge extra. And you I think used the word bewildering, which I think was accurate.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Listen, I think I think we understand what you're talking about. And it makes sense that it just can be part of everything, but there will be some things with There already have been that have benefited from some areas of technology, whether it's OCI and the other hyperscalers or whether it's Jensen and GPUs. If you take a step back from Oracle for a second, what other areas you think are likely to be beneficiaries and what other areas maybe could see some harm or to lease struggles because if they don't embrace it like some of the applications seem to say, well, if you're an application vendor, you don't embrace it and included in your technologies, you're going to fall behind.</p><p>But can you comment on that yield of the it's really interesting where we bought Cerner. It's another pillar for growth. I think you haven't quite seen it yet, but we bought we bought Cerner and then we're in the process of rewriting all of Cerner.</p><p>Now, how can we possibly rewrite all of Cerner in 18 months? We maybe will take us 24 months to fully write rewrite everything they did. But I think that's about how long it will take because we're not really rewriting it reject regenerating it using our coal generator, reusing co-generation and so what am I what am I getting the user interface?</p><p>The user interface for this new medical system is very different and I don't think I can charge separately for the user interface, for example, on when you want to look at the latest SEC raised, I did make my son into us at Stanford. I had a broken leg and took digital x-rays and the orthopedic surgeon couldn't find the address at Stanford.</p><p>They're using Epic and then MRO to be featured as a computer program in addition to be an orthopedic surgeon and he calls and the expert from radiology has also a dock and she comes in and she is also a computer Burger and she can find interest that it is actually about an hour ago. She can find efforts with Advocate, I mean is.</p><p>And then if I may, by bringing the Epic and Epic expert at Stanford and she found the address the three doctors that define me at my transactors. And this is how you find it easier to log in and do all those other things and then find the right thing to find a rig go to radiology department, find dive does diagnostic, no diagnostic devices and devices. It was stored on one of the unwanted one of the databases and one of the buildings at blah-blah-blah that final that's up.</p><p>This is how you do it with Oracle sells, Oracle, Chairman [Allison's] latest x-ray, if that's automatically logs and looks at you automatically logs and finds out finds the radiology fun times the radiology database brings knows you're a doctor who's can actually look at Allison's your authorized look at zinc, Allison's, easier patient, you're as your authorized actually look at that data and up pops the data second later, that's the difference.</p><p>That's all and enjoy the we have voice interfaces for all of all of this stuff, another exam. So how do I charge extra for that since I think that's no, I just think we'll sell more Cerner when we're competing with Epic as what I think will happen on another thing we do, and I probably told the stories too many times that, but in a doctor's meeting with the patient, one thing we did is very interesting when the doctor schedules their day, we mix in-person meetings with telemedicine Minis, we make no distinction for development. So telemedicine is just built into the system.</p><p>So it could be a remote kind of we use our own Zoom like telemedicine is a compliant, telemedicine, secure conferencing, but either but before you meet with the patient, either in person or via telemedicine, we prepared a summary.</p><p>We use a large language models or where somebody goes in and looks at your latest laboratory results, it looks at your latest entries in electronic health records looking at what medicines are currently on and prepares a summary for the doctor that they can read very, very quickly before they see the patients patient comes in and the doctor consults with the patient. We listen, the consultation has all this all AI. We listen to the consultation.</p><p>We then prepare because we're not board certified. And these we can't actually update the electronic health record directly. We have to prepare a draft for the doctor of the updates to the electronic health record to the new prescriptions to the orders and discharging of the patients in the hospital, doubling the dosage of the Life Stent approval from five milligrams a day from 2.5 milligrams to 5 milligrams.</p><p>And so we collect all the US then send that prescription to the pharmacy. We send the orders to the nurses' station. We automatically update the electronic health records, the moment the doctor reads, the summary and Okay.</p><p>And all of that, all of that is AI we don't charge separately for any or just how the application works. The obligation just works much better. The doctors spending not spending any time on it, but on the keyboard. So it makes the doctor much more efficient. It has more value and people are more likely to buy that than something where they just take three docs in a room design, find some x-rays of.</p><p>And I think you'll see that throughout through throughout the system and our system. We use at the autonomous database. We use AI to build the Autonomous Database AIS on the autonomous database, which is built on a I it's completely self-driving database, robot. Again, there's nothing like this just like there's nothing like the rack thing in our where we connect a lot of different computers together and create the illusion. It's one computer. It's no one's done that no one's done in the autonomous database with no DBA., there's not there's no configuration.</p><p>It's not that that's all done. That's all that's all done. And that's all a I we don't charge more for the autonomous database because it's autonomous. We think it's okay, it's more secure use, use less labor. It's more reliable all of those things, but it's just a better database, Johnny, you about it can be part of everything and everything is going to be better.</p><p>JOHN DIFUCCI: But there are some incremental things like that in video and OCI is a little bit larger and with any other like we'll where we'll sell more applications, we think because of our applications I take advantage of it and our database takes advantage of a I will sell more of it.</p><p>Okay. And separation or the separation is completely arbitrary like?</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: No, but I can. And I know that we I mean we could have a credit card fraud detection or expense report fraud detection program that was the okay or a Fusion and Fusion IA on accounting, will you bill a bill, you extra for credit and for our expense reporting system, the fraud detection modules separately, recharge new AI module, we can do that.</p><p>But in a way, I think it kind of misses the point, yes, we can always take features, separate features of any kind whether they're AI or not. And then we think there are particular valuer or another way. Very few people want them not everyone doesn't want them. You can't raise the price of the product or you don't really need to bring.</p><p>We're not trying to raise prices. We're trying to increase the volume of sales. And I think that's a better strategy that's more our strategies than kind of looking at a I know how do I get? I'm investing a lot of money and I how do I how do we get a return on that investment? Well, we want to sell more Fusion Speakman here, writ large. We want to sell more autonomous database, writ large was it more people to come to OCI.? And I think and it would be an exception for us to say, oh, that new particular AI feature we want to charge separately for.</p><p>Okay. All right in front of me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Larry, thank you very much for taking the question. You've been great at setting long-term visions and then delivering on it from Oracle is taking a different approach to security in the cloud delivering security out of the box versus everyone else, ICS to turn it on and now rather or decide what to turn on or not embedding more security with zipper building almost a security platform. I'm not sure exactly what you'd even define that as at this point, a security layer. Do you see this as something that as value to just the Oracle product.</p><p>So do you see this as something new and innovative that becomes almost a platform or product or a technology all unto itself because security is such a problem that's not being solved very well, although I could not agree with you more?</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: But I think this is the perfect Let me so long time ago, Oracle had two versions of this database because our first customer was the Central Intelligence Agency, Oracle's very first database was high.</p><p>We had a lot of security features and we had these two versions of the Oracle database we had one with and then we help them write this thing called the Orange Book. Now there's probably not a person left in the room, but even knows what that is anymore.</p><p>They are, but I'm old enough that unfortunately I'm yes, I know we have the right, right, the security bucket, and we have these two versions. I remember being in a meeting and it turns out it costs money us money to have two versions of anything we have to pay.</p><p>We have to build a secure version and then we have to build a slightly different version without defense and security features. And I will be in a meeting and said, okay, who was the database does not secure. So it is a little bit like you have heard the joke in the smart as it comes into the restaurant to build them in a restaurant.</p><p>And then what are you putting a drain on water and one guy says that yes, one and then clean glass and the waitress or waiter comes back and says giving, but in the what or who had to clean glass who answered the clean with the same that what the hell was not secure version of the database. What are you nuts? I mean, it is costing us extra money to build and not secure version of the database or we had never mind. So I mean, I am not quite answering your question, but coming close and I will get there.</p><p>So we will you kept turns it actually, I had this argument with our head of database of names. One of the ways I would love a brilliant guy and as a long time ago. And I said, okay, one from not everything all our back-up care encrypted there, you get no choice. Everything is encrypted. You cannot is a bit leery encryption because it takes time it costs more money to encrypt.</p><p>It really is a computer to encrypted and decrypted blah-blah-blah. I don't care. I don't want to be the guy that loses your data on now you don't get you don't have it. You don't get a choice eventually to me while, but eventually I won that argument and the So right now, I mean, you don't turn on well, I'm going to encrypt this at an Oracle database. I don't think so.</p><p>No, everything is encrypted. Everything. You don't get a choice on database in transit and storage. It's always it's always encrypted. We're very careful about all of this data and we don't we give you when you do recovery. We don't like you do recoveries you just say recovered to this point in time or recut?</p><p>Yes, we've been, let's say, recovered at this point in time, then hands off. We don't need we don't do that. We don't let people fly these things. What if you make a mistake in recovery and lose your data, oh, my God, you're going to blame me. I know I'm going to get the call know, I don't want that call. So we've taken away a lot of the choices.</p><p>That's kind of why we can't charge it includes it's kind of related which, Jonathan, we can't charge separately for security. A lot of you will do also that's a real great, great revenue opportunity. You could have the unsecure version of, but the guys with a little bit more money, they get the secure version or someone who just to get to buy the secure version within the secure version was available. I mean because a lot of the stuff is so complicated.</p><p>We decided that security. I don't want to read an article about getting hacked, losing data breadth of what our customers being ransomware hospitals being ransomware mess. I know I don't want I don't want to take that phone call out except for what I think that's our goal.</p><p>So we are just making our system more and more secure as we of customers, not our systems that are failing. We have customers that certainly have been hacked and ransomware and a big part of the reimbursement system for the US medical mean for US medicine was down for a while.</p><p>mean, I'm not going to start naming names, but thank God, it was not us and we're able we were able to help a lot of the customers recover. But we think securities another example, it's always on it's a part of the system. It's not an option if we can make that more secure, we're going to make it more secure. We're going to make it absolutely reliable. You can't make a mistake, you can't.</p><p>Oh, I want to know you asked for a level of reliability you can you can say I want this data center is hit by a media and is destroyed. I want to make sure I can immediately fail over to another data center. And then we have to if you want to do it instantaneously rather than just recovering, let's say in a minute, you want to recover in a 60 at the second and electrical cycle, we could do that.</p><p>But then that actually cost more because you have to have a full running system in another location so you may have to in that sense, pay for the redundancy for the reliability, but we don't think it should be. We don't think those are revenue opportunities. Maybe we're foolish but we don't think those are good ways to make more money. We think provide security, high degrees of reliability and then just sell more of it, can we get more customers on the back.</p><p>MARSHALL BUSH, ANALYST, BALEEN RESEARCH LLC: Marshall Bush, Baleen Research.</p><p>Thanks for doing this. This is always one of the most fun hours of the year. So if you think that AI is going to drive share shift at the application layer. Does that mean that the ultimate value capture will be at the infrastructure layer because AI-driven applications will inherently be more chatty with the database and the middleware?</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Yeah, really, really interesting question. I think there'll be applications that really do the job exploiting AI going to do very well. And I think the race the race to build the best, the best training systems, the race to build the best large language bottles, the race to build the best robotic models, you know, with the robotic models are very different than the LLM is interesting on the LOM is very different than because it is average check.</p><p>ChatGPT obviously began this revolution in the sense that, oh, my God, it talks now maybe talks and it was completely unexpected, but it's not real time. In other words, when once you produce, you have to prompt it sometimes in a car and a conversation think about how different it is when you're a robot, let's talk about a four wheel drive the robot called as Tesla self-driving car and you see something in the environment and you have to react in a tiny fraction of a second.</p><p>It is real time real time neural network. It's got to be you see a ball rollout in front of the car coming on coming up the curve and you see that what do you do you have to make a decision instantly as to what to do. That's very different than carry on a conversation, very different than looking at a cancer biopsy slide and trying to detect cancer in the biopsy side.</p><p>Those are all somewhat different problems that they are going to be saw they're going to need specifically trained our models that are somewhat different and they're going to need the appropriate applications that are a bit are quite different one from another.</p><p>So I think there's a zone where I don't know how to answer because I think there's opportunity significant opportunity at the end of the infrastructure at the AI infrastructure level and there's significant opportunity at the application level. I think I think this is a really big, big deal, and it's every place over here.</p><p>BRENT THILL, ANALYST, JEFFERIES: Brent Thill, Jefferies.</p><p>Was the success of OCID, do you think the applications growth rate will meaningfully accelerate? I know that you mentioned the backlog is driven by OCI today but is apps going to catch up and be the next.</p><p>The next slide here, you will, I think Cerner would now called Oracle health.</p><p>LAWRENCE ELLISON: Yeah, it's the biggest industry in the world, a multi-trillion dollar industry that hasn't been served by the IT industry at all. The two giants were Epic and Cerner were used to competing with Microsoft. Amazon Google, Epic and Cerner don't have those kind of resources that don't have. They don't have that level of talent.</p><p>So I think our medical system and we're by the way we're trying to do. We're trying to automate the entire medical ecosystem. But Cerner with Cerner and Epic, that is they automated acute care hospitals. And what Epic that specializes in is in the United States because the number one company for automating academic research hospitals, whether they hardly exist outside the United States like we're number one in Germany where I mean, we're almost the entire National Health Service in the UK at Oracle, Health Net or Cerner.</p><p>So that's it. And the others all scripted, a couple of little things, but there's how could the medical industry be completely underserved in terms of applications offer, it's stunning, how awful The systems are. And we expect and actually the purchase of Cerner has had an incredible impact on Oracle in terms of fundamental cultural change. I mean I made the statement of Oracle's actually able to fix this problem actually do a good job of automating health care around the world.</p><p>If we can do it, we must do it. We have a moral obligation to do it. I can't believe that this industry that is so important and touches all of us and all of our families. It doesn't have the very best technology support by our industry, but it's been largely ignored and people have dabbled in it and tried and to really change the medical industry.</p><p>You have to have to look at the entire ecosystem, not just acute care hospitals. You have to look at ambulatory clinics. You have to look at community hospitals, you have to look at Medical Laboratories and diagnostic laboratories. You have to look at payers, insurance, whether they're insurance companies or national governments.</p><p>Are you able to automate because the negotiation of the preauthorization of IA, you don't go into a hospital and you're having a hip replacement. If the hospital can't do the hip replacement without talking to the payer, whether that's a National Health Service in the UK or it's an insurance company in the US and get preauthorized?</p><p>Yes, if you do the replacement, you'll get paid for it and this is human beings on the bone discussing this and are you are you are you eligible? This is all crazy. This is all needs to be automated. The preauthorization needs to be automated. We need to--</p><p>And in the US at the end in the NHS in the UK, there are these waiting lists you might you need to see a doctor and you can see a doctor for six weeks for science and for something, well, you're calling one clinic. What if there's a doctor available in another clinic, eight miles away further away, we can send you to that. Has that has an opening they can see you tomorrow or the next day. They have no idea. They can't do that. They can't manage the load on other requests, loaded standard proper queuing theory, we've got and they can take it. They don't have to turn on systems to do that.</p><p>And we're managing everything from making people on smartphones. That's how you make an appointment. So that's how they are. We give you the I mean, will you can see your regular your regular clinic. If you if we can get you in on time, will then give you the option if you don't want your regular clinic and see you in four days. But we can get you and tomorrow at a clinic that's a little bit far away. Do you want do you want that?</p><p>So you have got to have a patient engagement system on your smartphone to make the appointments. If the doctor is running late, we don't want you to come, et cetera is sit around in the waiting room for a couple of hours. We'll let you know in advance that.</p><p>We're running we're running a weighting towards late. Please come a little bit later all of all of this stuff to make things more efficient, that doctors should be typing on keyboards that all should be done with . Are we doing all of that? How big is that will that alone is much bigger than our businesses now.</p><p>And we're talking about all the hospitals in Germany, all the hospitals, all the hospitals in Australia or the clinics in Germany or the clinics in France of the community hospitals. All the other pharmacies are all of the diagnostic laboratories and plus the governments who are usually the payers need systems to do all of that. Plus we have the need COVID made it very clear.</p><p>We need [NET] a system for national public health. We have no system for national public health, we had no idea. We said a shift to New York City are well intentioned because we thought New York City is running out of hospital beds during COVID during COVID?</p><p>No, they weren't almost no one went on that, Jeff. But we did just didn't know. We didn't know sending people back in the nursing homes was killing. People would take a long time. We didn't know COVID spread months before in our from Wuhan to Milan and Ney York.</p><p>We call it months after we share with a ship now and it's very easy to know when an epidemic or pandemic is beginning, we can even go back and open source satellite pictures, open source satellite pictures and looked at the parking lots in Wuhan and see their fill the [40 M] in acute care clinics, something's going on. We have no early warning systems. We have no global systems were pathology systems that look at look at a static gene sequence in a new coronavirus and say, wow, that that's a little bit different than I've ever seen before.</p><p>We've done that with the University of Oxford we built a global pathogen system. We've automate we've made we've attached gene sequencers toward the Internet of Things. So any hospital open quickly sequence a suspicious new pathogen, if you think it is something you haven't seen before?</p><p>I mean, of course, it renders PCR and all these other things are the PCR devices are also attached to the new PCR devices are also that we're doing all of that. So we're not just doing title or not doing what Cerner did we're doing.</p><p>We just sort of did plus a lot of other things to completely reform and automate and digitize the health care infrastructure for the world. And we have to do it in a way that is pretty economical that we can do. We can do that with that we can do community hospitals, how do you even communicate with community hospitals in Rwanda or if that's East Africa or in our community hospitals.</p><p>I'm in places in Central America, a New Guinea. There was a gentleman asked me a question couple of days ago from New Guinea. How do we how do we get the latest greatest digital technology in our country. We're not rich like some of the other people here. Well, we can communicate with all the community hospitals using StarLink.</p><p>We can use modern satellite technology to communicate with any school, any hospital collect all of this data. So we have a true early warning system for pandemics, the buyers and the providers you know, I was maybe I should say the payers, the government and insurance companies and their providers have a very easy way to get prior authorization that's highly automated, doesn't acumen the doctors getting on the phone treadmill begging for the latest cancer drug.</p><p>We can use AI to read the read your insurance policy. We can use AI to help you understand your legislation and to see whether that's covered or not. In most cases, we can look at the patient and the condition of the patient and tell you right away whether that should be covered.</p><p>We can do all of that, and that's what we're doing. And that's one example. That's one example I'll give you couple of other ones real quickly, securing schools we think we can absolutely lockdown schools so that dramatically reduce the case of anyone being on campus that doesn't belong on campus and immediately alert.</p><p>Second, someone pulls out again immediately alert recognize use AI cameras are immediately recognized, but a we keep everyone off. Campuses doesn't belong on campus, the police, and that's another thing we have body cameras. We recompleted the redesigned body cameras, our body cameras cost 70 bucks normal body camera cause fundamental $7,000. Our body cameras are simply lenses to lenses attached to your best attach the smartphone Neoware and we actually take the video that the police officer is available and the cameras always on you don't turn it on and off.</p><p>And but where do you turn it on you can't or not. You are going to badger Oracle. I need I need two minutes to take a bathroom break and we'll turn it off. The truth is we don't really turn it off. What we do is we record it. So no one can see it, but no one can get into that recording without a court order. So you get the privacy requested, but a court order, you get a court order.</p><p>We will judge to you can order it. I want to look at that. The so-called bathroom break. It is something if something comes up and I'm going to lunch with my friends are going in our for privacy with lunch. My friends god bless, we won't listen.</p><p>And unless there's a court order and we transmit the video back to headquarters. So headquarters and AI is constantly monitoring the video. Remember this terrible case in Memphis where the by police officers basically beat to death.</p><p>Another citizen in Memphis will that had happened because it would be on TV and TV at headquarters, everyone would see your body cams We transmitting that the police will be on their best behavior because we report regularly constantly recording, watching and recording everything that's going on.</p><p>Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on and it's on its unintelligible, the cars, the cars have Cameron cameras on them or we do have a squad target someplace but those kind of applications using an if we can use a and we're using AI to monitor the video so that all dictation it occurred that have occurred in Memphis, the Chiba believes would be immediately notified. It's not people that are looking at those cameras. It's AI was looking at again with.</p><p>No, no, no, you can't do. This would be like a shooting that's going to be immediately. That's going to be an advantage immediately and alarm is going to go off. It's going to be and we're going to we're going to of supervision.</p><p>And there was every police officer is going to be supervised at all times and supervision will be. And if there's a problem AI will report the problem then reported to the appropriate for a person, whether it's the sheriff for the chief for whom whomever we need to take control of the situation. We have drilled the same thing where we have drones with is that there's something going on in a shopping center and I'll stop the drone goes out or get their way faster than a police car.</p><p>There's every business for, by the way, high-speed chases, you shouldn't have high speed Jason's between cars or you just have a drone follow the car. I mean, it's very, very simple. And then new generation of autonomous drones on spotting forest fires, a or a drone spots of forest fire and the German then drops down and looked around to see if there's a human being near that he Bloom and someone else either had an unintended campfire, the car buyer or this or it's arson, we can detect all of that. That's all done autonomously with AI with all of these replicated.</p><p>All these are AI applications. And so the outlook, if you think about the application business and I'm just getting started there I mean, it's I'm sure you have the other. You have other things you do in your life. And just listen to me that there are so many opportunities to exploit an eye on one. This will be the last one we use satellite images to look at.</p><p>We can find all the farms in Kenya, all the farms in Rwanda, all the farms in Morocco, and we can look from the satellite will tell what they're growing. They're growing maize. We can report back if the northern part of the field needs more nitrogen more fertilizer, the southern part of the world needs more water. We can predict the we're using AI.</p><p>We can not only identify what the crop is being grown. We can forecast the output, the agricultural output of that country. Based on what we're looking at now, we can actually survey and forecast that if there's going to be a shortfall, if there's a drought, a drought that that's going to reduce the output. We can provide early warning to the people and the agricultural department of that nation state. We provide all that information.</p><p>So these are the kinds of systems we can the next-generation systems we can build using AI. So as I say back to the previous question, I think it's going to enable so many so much innovation. And so many different areas that the opportunity the world is going to be a better place as we exploit these opportunities and take advantage of this great technology.</p><p>Safra, [may I return.] Okay.

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Centerra Gold Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]</p><p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Lisa Wilkinson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications with Centerra Gold. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lisa Wilkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Centerra Gold's second quarter 2024 results conference call. Joining me on the call today are Paul Tomory, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Chawrun, Chief Operating Officer; and Ryan Snyder, Chief Financial Officer. Our release yesterday details our second quarter 2024 results. It should be read in conjunction with our MD&amp;A and financial statements, both of which can be found on SEDAR, EDGAR, and our website. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. Presentation slides accompanying this webcast are available on Centerra's website. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.</p><p>Before we begin, I would like to caution everyone that certain statements made today may be forward-looking and are subject to risks which may cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or implied. Please refer to the cautionary statements included in the presentation, as well as the risk factors set out in our annual information form. Certain measures we will discuss are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the description of non-GAAP measures in our news release and MD&amp;A issued yesterday.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Paul Tomory.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid operating performance and maintained consistent quarter-over-quarter cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid. Our year-to-date production costs are in line with our guidance ranges and full year 2024 consolidated guidance for production costs and capex is unchanged. In the first half of the year, we've made good progress executing on our strategic plan focused on maximizing the value of each asset in our portfolio.</p><p>Earlier this year, we announced an additional agreement with Royal Gold, which allows us to assess Mount Milligan's potential to be a multi-decade operation. This was the first key step in our strategy to realize the full potential of this cornerstone asset located in a top-tier mining jurisdiction. We continue to progress work on the preliminary economic assessment to update the larger resource to include all the drilling completed to date, to identify value-added initiatives to the plant and to optimize the mine plan.</p><p>We expect to complete the study in the first half of 2025. Also at Mount Milligan, we have continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program that was initially launched last year and Paul Chawrun will speak to this later in the call. We remain focused on maximizing the value of our Molybdenum Business Unit assets, which are comprised of the Thompson Creek mine, the Endako mine and the Langeloth Metallurgical facility.</p><p>In the second quarter, we advanced our permitting work at Thompson Creek with strong collaboration and proactive support from our regulatory partners. We successfully obtained authorizations for additional lands at Thompson Creek mine, which will enable a proposed pit highwall layback. This is an important deliverable in the overall permitting process and provides for a long runway of mining activities under the current plan.</p><p>We remain on track to release the Thompson Creek FS study later this year, at which time we also expect to outline our commercial optimization plan for Langeloth. We're encouraged by the value opportunity in Langeloth and the expected synergies with the Thompson Creek mine. With respect to our pipeline of growth projects, we continue to progress work at the Goldfield property in Nevada. Our focus this year has been on exploration on the large land package, looking for more oxide material, as well as metallurgical test work to support a lower capital flow sheet to maximize returns on the project. We expect to release an initial resource at Goldfield by the end of the year.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives. In line with our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices, we recently published our 2023 Annual ESG report. We've made meaningful progress in our sustainability journey over the past year, marked by significant achievements across the organization, including the following. Throughout 2023 and this year, efforts have been made to identify potential efficiencies in greenhouse gas reduction opportunities at the site level, with the goal of establishing attainable targets. Second, the number of reportable incidents decreased by 17%.</p><p>Thirdly, we contributed over $3.2 million to community investments and donations across our operations. And finally, we achieved the 2026 gender diversity goal two years ahead of schedule, with 38% female representation on the Board of Directors and 33% among officers of the company. As we look ahead, we're dedicated to continuing our efforts to drive sustainable value and positive impact.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass the call over to Paul, who will walk through our operational performance for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Paul. I'd like to start with Mount Milligan's safety performance. The operating team continues to embrace the site-wide optimization program, which starts with continuous improvement to our safety performance. Year-to-date, we have seen evidence of this through a significant reduction in high-potential incidents. I would also like to congratulate our Mount Milligan mine rescue team for placing first overall in the Northern BC competition.</p><p>On slide five, we show operating highlights at Mount Milligan for the quarter. Mount Milligan produced over 38,000 ounces of gold and over 13 million pounds of copper in the second quarter. Gold and copper sales were down quarter-over-quarter, which was anticipated due to the timing of shipments. Both gold and copper sales are expected to increase in the second half of the year, contributing approximately 60% of the annual sales.</p><p>In the second quarter, all-in-sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $1,234 per ounce, higher quarter-over-quarter due to lower sales and higher sustaining capex. The 2024 guidance metrics at Mount Milligan remain unchanged. During the second quarter, we continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program at Mount Milligan that was initially launched last year. This program has been focused on a holistic assessment of occupational health and safety, as well as improvements in mine and plant operations.</p><p>While the optimization program is still ongoing, year-to-date, we have begun to see productivity improvements in the load-haul cycle at the mine, as well as the plant processing costs. In the first six months of 2024, milling costs at Mount Milligan were $5.60 per ton processed, 12% lower than the same period last year. Due to the longer-term nature of the mining optimization initiatives, we expect to see improvements in the unit mining costs in 2025.</p><p>Now moving on to Oksut. Starting with safety performance, year-to-date Oksut is tracking on target on both total reportable injury frequency rate and severity rate. By embracing various safety systems and programs, including our Work Safe Home Safe initiative, we are demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement in our journey towards Zero Harm.</p><p>On slide six, we show operating highlights at Oksut for the quarter. Second quarter production was over 51,000 ounces. This is less than last quarter due to the winding down of inventory built up during the operations shutdown in 2022 and 2023. Our 2024 production guidance at Oksut is unchanged with approximately 40% to 45% of the annual production weighted to the second half of the year.</p><p>In the second quarter, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $943 per ounce, which is higher compared to last quarter due to lower sales and higher royalty costs resulting from higher average realized gold prices. Oksut's cost guidance ranges for the full year of 2024 are unchanged. However, we could be at the high end or potentially exceed the guidance range if gold prices remain at current elevated levels, mainly driven by higher royalty rates.</p><p>I'll now pass it on to Ryan, to walk through our financial highlights for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Paul. Slide seven details our second quarter financial results. Adjusted net earnings in the second quarter were $47 million or $0.23 per share. In the second quarter, sales were 83,258 ounces of gold and 11.7 million pounds of copper. The average realized price was $2,097 per ounce of gold and $3.79 per pound of copper, which incorporates the existing streaming arrangements at Mount Milligan. At the Molybdenum Business Unit, approximately 2.7 million pounds of molybdenum was sold in the second quarter at the Langeloth facility, at an average realized price of $22.10 per pound. This annualized throughput rate represents utilization of approximately 30% of the facility's capacity.</p><p>More details on future plans for Langeloth are expected to be provided later this summer with the release of the Thompson Creek Mine feasibility study. Consolidated all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis in the second quarter were $1,179 per ounce and our full-year consolidated guidance for unit cost metrics is unchanged.</p><p>Slide eight, shows our financial highlights for the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated consistent cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid of $94 million. After routine statutory tax and royalty payments to the Turkish government in the second quarter, cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis for the quarter was $3 million and we had a free cash flow deficit of $27 million.</p><p>In the second quarter, Mount Milligan generated $29 million in cash from operations and $14 million in free cash flow. Due to the timing of shipments, gold, and copper sales volumes are expected to be higher in the second half of the year. Oksut used $2 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $11 million in the second quarter. This was impacted by routine statutory tax and royalty payments of $105 million made to the Turkish government. We expect to generate strong cash flow from operations at Oksut in the second half of 2024.</p><p>The Molybdenum Business Unit as a whole used $8 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $13 million this quarter. This related primarily to activities at the Thompson Creek mine, as Langeloth operating cash flows were breakeven for the second quarter. Interest income was $8 million in the second quarter, which primarily includes interest on bank term deposits. We continue to generate significant interest income on our cash balance.</p><p>A key focus for Centerra is returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we were active on share buybacks, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for total consideration of $10 million. Also, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key pillar in our capital allocation strategy and we expect to remain active on the share buybacks dependent on market conditions. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $592 million. This provides us with total liquidity of $992 million and positions us well to execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value.</p><p>I'll pass it back to Paul, for some closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ryan. We remain committed to delivering consistent operating results each quarter and driving value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to deliver on our strategic plan with the release of the Thompson Creek feasibility study and the Langeloth commercial optimization plan later this summer.</p><p>And with that operator, we'll open the call for questions, please.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Anita Soni from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Paul. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is with regards to Oksut and the pit sequencing. I think I was expecting a little bit more stripping to be done this quarter and I'm just wondering if some of that was pushed out into the back half of the year or are you done with this -- the stripping campaign that you had that I think was happening in the first half of the year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Anita. It's Paul here. We're continuing with our waste stripping through the year, that's relatively even and it's approximately 16 million tons, so we're on track for that. We did have a little bit of change in our ore sequencing, though and that was really just to blend our Guneytepe pit, which is higher grade, has a little bit higher clay and so we needed to adjust our mine ore sequencing. And then we did have, as we noted in the MD&amp;A, we did have a little bit of dilution due to the rainy season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So, what you're saying that this quarter you were in a higher grade -- it was actually lower quarter-over-quarter, I'm not -- little confused about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>No, no. We needed to change the ore sequencing timing in the larger pit, the Keltepe pit, because we needed to blend some of the higher grade on Guneytepe, overall, the grade was lower. And then, of course, we were winding down the inventory that was built up during the shutdown.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thanks. That helps. And then just a bigger, broader question for Paul Tomory. As you think about, you do have some significant free cash flow coming into the back half of the year. As you think about where gold prices sit and where molybdenum sits, has that changed your thinking at all in terms of what gets prioritized in terms of use of cash?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>In terms of use of cash, the first thing coming down our pipe here is the Thompson Creek feasibility study, so that's coming here at the end of the summer. We're happy with where things are at on molybdenum price, but more importantly, we've done a lot of work internally over the last six, eight months on understanding the value potential of the integration between Thompson Creek and Langeloth and that'll be shown when we put out those study results. So we really like what we're seeing on the Thompson Creek, Langeloth combination and you'll see that when we put out our results and our intended path forward. So that remains an area where we will prioritize capital allocation.</p><p>The other -- we're always looking at opportunities externally to add specifically on the gold side. But as you know, things are pretty fully valued out there and a lot of the assets that come up for sale are not always, you know, they'll have various issues technically or locationally or another matter. So we're very disciplined in the way we look at M&amp;A. So another example is this past quarter we made an investment in a Junior and we think there's good value to be had very early in the chain, partnering with Junior's explorers and that forms another key part of our capital allocation.</p><p>So, yes, Molybdenum will remain something we're going to talk about in the near-term here. We continue to look for opportunities in gold and that remains a major strategic focus. And by the drill bit as well, we're going to continue drilling and we're also going to provide updates on our resource models for Goldfield and Mount Milligan by the end of the year and we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing, particularly at Mount Milligan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, I'll leave it there and get back in the queue. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Raj Ray from BMO. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, Paul and team. My first question is on Mount Milligan. Q2 grades were lower, you did mention it was mine sequencing, but was it lower than what you had expected or it was as per what your mine plan suggested? And then looking at the second half of the year, how should we look at grades for Q3 and Q4? And then also on recovery for gold, slightly lower, should we expect second half recoveries to pick up again like Q1 or do you expect recoveries to hover around these levels? So that's first on Mount Milligan. And then secondly, with respect to the Moly study that's coming up, I understand that once the feasibility study is out, you will decide on what capital to spend, but should we anticipate any spend in Q4 or is this more a 2025 if and when you decide to spend any capital there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Well, Paul will do the Mount Milligan and I'll take over on Langeloth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Okay. Okay. So Mount Milligan, there was a number of questions there. So in Q2, yeah, we had standard mine sequencing and that's why you saw the grades somewhat lower. That being said, in terms of recovery, our gold recovery, we can expect that to go up a little bit. And that's just some of the initiatives that we're doing on our optimization program, we're calling that M Plus. So we can expect to see somewhat higher gold recovery for a number of different reasons. And then in terms of the grade going forward to the remainder of the year, I think the best thing to do is just take a look at our guidance we're on track for that and then that will pan out. But we will expect a little bit higher grades for the remainder of the year, not exceptionally higher. And I think that was the bulk of your questions on Mount Milligan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>All right. So on Molybdenum, Ryan would have mentioned in his prepared remarks that there was some spending in the quarter at Thompson Creek related to early works activities. We continue to do that. So in anticipation of the project study coming out in a few weeks here, we continue to prepare the site for a potential go decision on the project and so there has been some spending and there will continue to be spending here through August and into September as we prepare for a decision there.</p><p>If you want more details, Ryan could speak to that, but perhaps that answers your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>No, that's good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>I think...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>We will guide the spending for the remainder of the year as part of that release. So if we do go forward, there will be spending, there is spending now. There is early works, as Paul says, it will provide an updated number for the remainder of 2024 with that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's great. Thank you. That's it for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from John Sclodnick from Desjardin. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess looking at Goldfield, it looks like, I guess most of the planned drilling is done. Just wondering if you can give any indication on kind of what you're seeing there, maybe cutoff date for the resource estimate if you're thinking about using the same resource gold price of 1800 or if you might take that up? And how those column leach tests have been going?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So I'll remind -- because we did that pivot on Goldfield, what we're looking for here is a principally run of mine oxide resource, so we had to prove to ourselves two or three key things. One is that we have sufficient oxide material, having temporarily put disulfide on the shelf. We continue to drill and we are adding to our internal view on quantity there and the column leach tests are going extremely well. We're getting recoveries in line with what I would have expected for run of mine Nevada oxide. So those are going very well.</p><p>In terms of drilling, we will do more drilling this year and we will incorporate the remainder of that drilling into our resource estimate. With that resource estimate, we will also put out what the recoveries look like, a high-level view on a flow sheet and then a path forward on engineering and a potential path to execution. Your second question there is, what do we use a higher gold price for the resource at Goldfield, potentially, I mean, it's a relatively low-risk in Nevada, fairly easily digestible project. We haven't made that decision yet, but certainly, I think what you're asking is a good question. We're going through the same logic as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yeah, no, appreciate that color and looking forward to the update there. I guess one other one for me. This is just kind of annoying modeling one, but the depreciation has been trending a bit below guidance and then just wondering if that's going to pick up in the second half or if you're kind of going to be targeting the low end of that depreciation guidance range?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably heading towards the lower end of it. Mount Milligan, with the increase in reserves at the end of last year brings down that depreciation a little bit. It will pick up a bit in the second half of the year as we sell more material at Mount Milligan, but I think we're heading towards the lower end of the range on that, yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Appreciate that and, yeah, Raj asked my Mount Milligan question, so good for me. Thanks, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Mike Parkin from National Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, guys. Couple questions for me. Could you first start off, there's quite a few forest fires in BC, are you seeing any impact at site or at risk of being able to move material in or out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question. We pay very close attention to that, of course. At this moment in time, we're actually category two, which is fairly low risk, it's not the lowest category one would be. There was a period of time earlier in the quarter, we were at category three. There were a number of fires. We had the fire in Jasper and some of the other locations, but no, that's not an issue in our locale at Mount Milligan and back in April, we had a fire relatively close to Endako and we were on alert for evacuation there, but that didn't need to happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>And can you just remind us in terms of, like, the forest fire seasonality, is that something that generally kind of continues through Q3 and then as you get into, like probably, I'm guessing kind of late Q3, it dies down in Q4, it's like a non-issue with, like, snowfall?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Well, definitely Q4, it's a non-issue. Best way to answer that is we're in a bit of a different climate change. It's always been out in Western Canada that you had May, June was the high-risk period right after the fresh head. But that being said, we've seen risks right early in April, right on through to August and September in the past. So we're on alert right through.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Last year was a lot worse for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, BC was worse, but it's also where you are in BC. At this moment in time, it's not as high risk as it has been in the past throughout in the past of this summer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Just circling back like you're making some pretty impressive cost improvement success at Mount Milligan, something you guys certainly were highlighting here some low-hanging fruit on the site tour last year. With respect to the mining cost improvement, can you give us a bit more color on what are the initiatives like focus that? Is it like, I know tire life was, I think, something standing water on roads improvement that seemed like some kind of low-hanging fruit from site tour. Can you just give us some high level of like, where you're focused in the near-term and where you expect to kind of realize those savings?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So there is always some opportunity on consumables like tires and diesel, perhaps a little bit on powder factory, although we got to be very careful on fragmentation since that's the main goal. But the bulk of the gain is going to come from improving the load-haul cycle production and productivity and that's actually already been happening at site. Why we're not seeing in the unit operating costs for the quarter is because we did have some residual costs on equipment, some of the major component changeouts, so it doesn't reflect in the operating costs. And so going forward, it's really going to come from the load-haul cycle itself and improving on all the various components there, that's where the biggest ticket is.</p><p>And then, of course, some of the other items, like the consumables, as you pointed out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>It's like the vision of making the pit bigger, does that -- I remember from site, I think it would, the way I would kind of summarize it was if you guys were specking the equipment, you wouldn't have necessarily picked the equipment that's there now. It would seem kind of the wrong size for the operation. Does that like with this expansion you're talking about in pit size, does that make use of that underutilized scale of the fleet or are you all still looking to like as assets mature in terms of rolling stock, do you look to optimize scale going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, that's a great question. So if you were to start fresh, you might look at a different fleet, of course, probably the biggest one that I would change right away would be the loaders, the use of the loaders, the 994s in the pit, but that's what we're working with. So going forward, we'll optimize those. In terms of the change out of the fleet proper, we need to do the decision to capital allocation decision based on what we have. And for the long-term expansion, of course, there's a number of different options we can take a look at expand -- extending the current fleet, we can take a look at a larger -- a larger truck size, but then, of course, the larger your truck size, you then have to take a look at what the overall productivity is and where you're coming from the different phase events and you have a little bit less optionality on that.</p><p>So we're looking at all these options, but I think the overarching component of our current stock and then going forward, what would make the most sense, you need to take a look at what we have today and use it in your capital allocation, that's far and away the most important variable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks. That's it for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning and thank you for taking my question. It relates back to the Moly operations and again, the study. You've talked a lot about the potential at Langeloth and it's only working at 30% of capacity. When you come out with the details, I assume we're going to get a Thompson Creek study, which is sort of apples-to-apples to what we did before, but the second part of it at Langeloth, in that analysis, are you just going to assume the integration of Thompson Creek or given I think there's even more excess capacity, does the fact that you can actually put the Thompson Creek stuff in allow you to go out and get more third party material, so we'll not only get the benefit of, you know, the Thompson Creek material over, fixed costs over larger volumes and things like that, but there'll be another uptick. Is that what we're getting on the Langeloth study or to the extent you can comment on that, it'd be helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think you've described the strategy well. One of, I'd say that the most important component of our thinking on the Molybdenum Business Unit, meaning the integrated Thompson Creek-Langeloth operation is that Langeloth is the principal value driver, it's not the only value driver, but it's the principal value driver. And by utilizing that fixed cost leverage and increasing utilization of the capacity there, we not only create a strong EBITDA business, but we also, to a large degree, insulate ourselves from fluctuations in molybdenum price because of the way we would purchase concentrate up from a third party and then sell it onward to the steelmakers.</p><p>So the strategy here is, use Thompson Creek as a significant component of filling the capacity at Langeloth. So as you pointed out, we're roughly running at one-third capacity. In broad brush terms, Thompson Creek would fill the second third, which would then allow us to fill the final third with third-party material and particularly dirtier or higher copper content cons where we can charge a bigger spread, a bigger TCRC because we have the very clean con coming from Thompson Creek.</p><p>When you look at the world of molybdenum, interestingly, the two cleanest cons out there are actually Thompson Creek and Endako. So the Thompson Creek feed the con from there will allow us significant flexibility in blending in order to fill that final third. So, yes, the answer to your question, which you kind of previewed there is, that study will be a standalone mine feasibility study with its accompanying NI 43-101, but we will have an entire other section showing the economics of the integrated whole, Thomas Creek and Langeloth and you will see that the value is generated in significant part by an optimal use of the roasting facility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Right. But just so I'm clear, would that study assume 66% utilization of Langeloth?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>No or you could actually could...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>No, much higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>No.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Right. Yeah. Okay, so you'll be able to do 100, so you'll make assumptions about what you can do on the other side and we'll get to see all that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Precisely, yes. But the important part is that Thompson Creek enables that ramp from 66 to 100 because you now have the clean con that you can blend with higher copper percentage cons. So, yes, we will show a full ramp-up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. And again, just to be clear, as you said, the value add is in treating the dirty cons, it's not like you bring Endako into that something, because it's another clean con. So it's still a total standalone unit that you have to look at going forward if you decide to go down that route, is that fair?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so I think that if you were to look at this very, very high level strategically, Endako has no place in the plan until Thompson Creek is exhausted. So if you look at a perfect situation here, you run Thompson Creek and then, whatever, 15, 20 years later, you then bring Endako into the mix as the next source of clean con, which you can then use. It would not be good for us to open both together.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Great. That's what I thought, but I just wanted to confirm. Thanks very much. That's very, very helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeremy Hoy from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeremy Hoy:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Paul and team, thanks for taking the question. You guys have made some good progress with your optimization study at Mount Milligan, we saw that in your per ton processing costs this quarter. Do you expect to see continuing improvements in the processing throughout the year or have they largely been realized? And then am I correct in assuming that those were not factored in when providing guidance at the beginning of the year for costs for the operation and that's it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. So first, no, we did not include these gains in our guidance at the beginning of the year and so and to answer your question, are we going to continue to see gains? So this is a very long-term view. And so we had some low-hanging fruit, recycling some of the steel which was a big gain. We're looking at optimization of our concentrate qualities. So that actually improves our overall gold. And so that's why you're seeing some of the gains in the plant. And yes, we're looking at a number of different optimization programs to improve the plant overall, both on recoveries, throughput and also the mine-to-mill because if we can have a steady state and have less disruptions in the plant, then that actually helps the overall costs.</p><p>And then lastly, through the winter, that was a problematic area and we've done quite a lot of gains there. So yes, we can expect to see continuous improvement in the plan, but just overarching. This is a comprehensive program to put Mount Milligan into a world-class operation and this was key for the long-range plan. And so we'll be adopting those operating metrics into the PDA and into the plan itself going forward with these demonstrable improvements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>And I'll use this as an opportunity to plug the PEA. What we're looking at here at Mount Milligan is a very significant potential mine life extension beyond the 2035 reserve, incorporating the drilling that I mentioned earlier. We're doing a lot of drilling, we're getting very good results on that. So we're looking at a resource model update. We're looking at, I'll remind that we're currently capped on reserves with tailings capacity. We're looking at incremental opportunities to store tailings and we're making good progress on that. And lastly, as Paul said, we're incorporating these new operating metrics into the way we look at mine and plant operations for consideration in that study. So things are going well on that study and we're hard at work on it and we still need several months to do that, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeremy Hoy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thanks for the color and we'll look forward to see further results from that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jeremy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-e6858a19fa9958128aff9b1eeead18bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC8-X393-RSJ9-B084-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 AlphaStreet Inc.

In each class, Associate Professor of Communication Arts and Design Michael Iauch guides students through that year's Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a lengthy annual report that, according to the report itself, \"summarizes the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After examining the 2022 report's Summary for Policymakers (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/\">https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/</url>), each class this semester was tasked with identifying a piece of data or information they found particularly salient, and proposing an art project that addresses that issue. The classes then worked as a team to bring their vision for the project to life.</p><p>\"The focus of the class is the way that the landscape has been portrayed by artists over the last 100 years. It's an important class to be taught right now because of all the climate issues that we're facing globally,\" Iauch said. \"It's also impactful for students to realize artists are capable of addressing these issues as well as scientists.\"</p><p>During the Fall 2023 semester, Iauch taught two units of the course. The students in each class identified different details from the report that they found impactful. One group focused on coral gardening in their piece, while the other highlighted dam removal. As shown throughout this year's IPCC Assessment Report, these are potential solutions to issues of dire importance to the current and future health of our planet.</p><p>Coral reefs, for instance, are one of the ecosystems the report says will suffer increased species extinction and loss of biodiversity as Earth continues to warm. Coral gardening, the focus of one of this semester's projects, is a coral reef restoration strategy in which pieces of healthy coral are cut into much smaller segments and attached to material where they can grow in a controlled environment before being reintroduced to their natural habitat and becoming part of a larger reef.</p><p>\"We decided to create an archway to allow for 360-degree interaction with our project,\" the class's artist statement writes. The archway was covered with handmade pieces of \"coral\" the students constructed out of paper, wire, and masking tape, and covered in plaster gauze. \"As college students, we need to be informed about important environmental issues and take action. Our project accomplishes this through an eye-catching and engaging art installation.\"</p><p>The second class sought to address the impacts dams have on rivers, watersheds, and the plants and animals that call those habitats home. The group collected single-use plastic and aluminum waste--including cans, bottles, and bottle caps--cut them into small pieces, and arranged them to create a mosaic depicting a dam surrounded by a raging forest fire.</p><p>\"Dams disrupt ecosystems. Dams can trap sediment that covers rock beds where fish spawn. Dam removal restores healthy river ecosystems by improving water quality and allowing normal sediment flow,\" the class wrote in their artist statement. \"The yellow, red, and orange fire surrounding the water represents the complex interconnected issues that are bound up with climate change and also suggests the urgency with which we must act to address this global issue.\"</p><p>By using discarded trash and recyclables as the primary material for both pieces, the students not only addressed the environmental issues at the heart of their work, but also repurposed single-use items, giving them a second life of educational importance and saving them from ending up in a landfill.

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Centerra Gold Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]</p><p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Lisa Wilkinson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications with Centerra Gold. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lisa Wilkinson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Centerra Gold's second quarter 2024 results conference call. Joining me on the call today are Paul Tomory, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Chawrun, Chief Operating Officer; and Ryan Snyder, Chief Financial Officer. Our release yesterday details our second quarter 2024 results. It should be read in conjunction with our MD&amp;A and financial statements, both of which can be found on SEDAR, EDGAR, and our website. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. Presentation slides accompanying this webcast are available on Centerra's website. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.</p><p>Before we begin, I would like to caution everyone that certain statements made today may be forward-looking and are subject to risks which may cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or implied. Please refer to the cautionary statements included in the presentation, as well as the risk factors set out in our annual information form. Certain measures we will discuss are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the description of non-GAAP measures in our news release and MD&amp;A issued yesterday.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Paul Tomory.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid operating performance and maintained consistent quarter-over-quarter cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid. Our year-to-date production costs are in line with our guidance ranges and full year 2024 consolidated guidance for production costs and capex is unchanged. In the first half of the year, we've made good progress executing on our strategic plan focused on maximizing the value of each asset in our portfolio.</p><p>Earlier this year, we announced an additional agreement with Royal Gold, which allows us to assess Mount Milligan's potential to be a multi-decade operation. This was the first key step in our strategy to realize the full potential of this cornerstone asset located in a top-tier mining jurisdiction. We continue to progress work on the preliminary economic assessment to update the larger resource to include all the drilling completed to date, to identify value-added initiatives to the plant and to optimize the mine plan.</p><p>We expect to complete the study in the first half of 2025. Also at Mount Milligan, we have continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program that was initially launched last year and Paul Chawrun will speak to this later in the call. We remain focused on maximizing the value of our Molybdenum Business Unit assets, which are comprised of the Thompson Creek mine, the Endako mine and the Langeloth Metallurgical facility.</p><p>In the second quarter, we advanced our permitting work at Thompson Creek with strong collaboration and proactive support from our regulatory partners. We successfully obtained authorizations for additional lands at Thompson Creek mine, which will enable a proposed pit highwall layback. This is an important deliverable in the overall permitting process and provides for a long runway of mining activities under the current plan.</p><p>We remain on track to release the Thompson Creek FS study later this year, at which time we also expect to outline our commercial optimization plan for Langeloth. We're encouraged by the value opportunity in Langeloth and the expected synergies with the Thompson Creek mine. With respect to our pipeline of growth projects, we continue to progress work at the Goldfield property in Nevada. Our focus this year has been on exploration on the large land package, looking for more oxide material, as well as metallurgical test work to support a lower capital flow sheet to maximize returns on the project. We expect to release an initial resource at Goldfield by the end of the year.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives. In line with our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices, we recently published our 2023 Annual ESG report. We've made meaningful progress in our sustainability journey over the past year, marked by significant achievements across the organization, including the following. Throughout 2023 and this year, efforts have been made to identify potential efficiencies in greenhouse gas reduction opportunities at the site level, with the goal of establishing attainable targets. Second, the number of reportable incidents decreased by 17%.</p><p>Thirdly, we contributed over $3.2 million to community investments and donations across our operations. And finally, we achieved the 2026 gender diversity goal two years ahead of schedule, with 38% female representation on the Board of Directors and 33% among officers of the company. As we look ahead, we're dedicated to continuing our efforts to drive sustainable value and positive impact.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass the call over to Paul, who will walk through our operational performance for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Paul. I'd like to start with Mount Milligan's safety performance. The operating team continues to embrace the site-wide optimization program, which starts with continuous improvement to our safety performance. Year-to-date, we have seen evidence of this through a significant reduction in high-potential incidents. I would also like to congratulate our Mount Milligan mine rescue team for placing first overall in the Northern BC competition.</p><p>On slide five, we show operating highlights at Mount Milligan for the quarter. Mount Milligan produced over 38,000 ounces of gold and over 13 million pounds of copper in the second quarter. Gold and copper sales were down quarter-over-quarter, which was anticipated due to the timing of shipments. Both gold and copper sales are expected to increase in the second half of the year, contributing approximately 60% of the annual sales.</p><p>In the second quarter, all-in-sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $1,234 per ounce, higher quarter-over-quarter due to lower sales and higher sustaining capex. The 2024 guidance metrics at Mount Milligan remain unchanged. During the second quarter, we continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program at Mount Milligan that was initially launched last year. This program has been focused on a holistic assessment of occupational health and safety, as well as improvements in mine and plant operations.</p><p>While the optimization program is still ongoing, year-to-date, we have begun to see productivity improvements in the load-haul cycle at the mine, as well as the plant processing costs. In the first six months of 2024, milling costs at Mount Milligan were $5.60 per ton processed, 12% lower than the same period last year. Due to the longer-term nature of the mining optimization initiatives, we expect to see improvements in the unit mining costs in 2025.</p><p>Now moving on to Oksut. Starting with safety performance, year-to-date Oksut is tracking on target on both total reportable injury frequency rate and severity rate. By embracing various safety systems and programs, including our Work Safe Home Safe initiative, we are demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement in our journey towards Zero Harm.</p><p>On slide six, we show operating highlights at Oksut for the quarter. Second quarter production was over 51,000 ounces. This is less than last quarter due to the winding down of inventory built up during the operations shutdown in 2022 and 2023. Our 2024 production guidance at Oksut is unchanged with approximately 40% to 45% of the annual production weighted to the second half of the year.</p><p>In the second quarter, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $943 per ounce, which is higher compared to last quarter due to lower sales and higher royalty costs resulting from higher average realized gold prices. Oksut's cost guidance ranges for the full year of 2024 are unchanged. However, we could be at the high end or potentially exceed the guidance range if gold prices remain at current elevated levels, mainly driven by higher royalty rates.</p><p>I'll now pass it on to Ryan, to walk through our financial highlights for the quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Paul. Slide seven details our second quarter financial results. Adjusted net earnings in the second quarter were $47 million or $0.23 per share. In the second quarter, sales were 83,258 ounces of gold and 11.7 million pounds of copper. The average realized price was $2,097 per ounce of gold and $3.79 per pound of copper, which incorporates the existing streaming arrangements at Mount Milligan. At the Molybdenum Business Unit, approximately 2.7 million pounds of molybdenum was sold in the second quarter at the Langeloth facility, at an average realized price of $22.10 per pound. This annualized throughput rate represents utilization of approximately 30% of the facility's capacity.</p><p>More details on future plans for Langeloth are expected to be provided later this summer with the release of the Thompson Creek Mine feasibility study. Consolidated all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis in the second quarter were $1,179 per ounce and our full-year consolidated guidance for unit cost metrics is unchanged.</p><p>Slide eight, shows our financial highlights for the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated consistent cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid of $94 million. After routine statutory tax and royalty payments to the Turkish government in the second quarter, cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis for the quarter was $3 million and we had a free cash flow deficit of $27 million.</p><p>In the second quarter, Mount Milligan generated $29 million in cash from operations and $14 million in free cash flow. Due to the timing of shipments, gold, and copper sales volumes are expected to be higher in the second half of the year. Oksut used $2 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $11 million in the second quarter. This was impacted by routine statutory tax and royalty payments of $105 million made to the Turkish government. We expect to generate strong cash flow from operations at Oksut in the second half of 2024.</p><p>The Molybdenum Business Unit as a whole used $8 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $13 million this quarter. This related primarily to activities at the Thompson Creek mine, as Langeloth operating cash flows were breakeven for the second quarter. Interest income was $8 million in the second quarter, which primarily includes interest on bank term deposits. We continue to generate significant interest income on our cash balance.</p><p>A key focus for Centerra is returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we were active on share buybacks, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for total consideration of $10 million. Also, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key pillar in our capital allocation strategy and we expect to remain active on the share buybacks dependent on market conditions. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $592 million. This provides us with total liquidity of $992 million and positions us well to execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value.</p><p>I'll pass it back to Paul, for some closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ryan. We remain committed to delivering consistent operating results each quarter and driving value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to deliver on our strategic plan with the release of the Thompson Creek feasibility study and the Langeloth commercial optimization plan later this summer.</p><p>And with that operator, we'll open the call for questions, please.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Anita Soni from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Paul. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is with regards to Oksut and the pit sequencing. I think I was expecting a little bit more stripping to be done this quarter and I'm just wondering if some of that was pushed out into the back half of the year or are you done with this -- the stripping campaign that you had that I think was happening in the first half of the year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Anita. It's Paul here. We're continuing with our waste stripping through the year, that's relatively even and it's approximately 16 million tons, so we're on track for that. We did have a little bit of change in our ore sequencing, though and that was really just to blend our Guneytepe pit, which is higher grade, has a little bit higher clay and so we needed to adjust our mine ore sequencing. And then we did have, as we noted in the MD&amp;A, we did have a little bit of dilution due to the rainy season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So, what you're saying that this quarter you were in a higher grade -- it was actually lower quarter-over-quarter, I'm not -- little confused about that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>No, no. We needed to change the ore sequencing timing in the larger pit, the Keltepe pit, because we needed to blend some of the higher grade on Guneytepe, overall, the grade was lower. And then, of course, we were winding down the inventory that was built up during the shutdown.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. All right. Thanks. That helps. And then just a bigger, broader question for Paul Tomory. As you think about, you do have some significant free cash flow coming into the back half of the year. As you think about where gold prices sit and where molybdenum sits, has that changed your thinking at all in terms of what gets prioritized in terms of use of cash?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>In terms of use of cash, the first thing coming down our pipe here is the Thompson Creek feasibility study, so that's coming here at the end of the summer. We're happy with where things are at on molybdenum price, but more importantly, we've done a lot of work internally over the last six, eight months on understanding the value potential of the integration between Thompson Creek and Langeloth and that'll be shown when we put out those study results. So we really like what we're seeing on the Thompson Creek, Langeloth combination and you'll see that when we put out our results and our intended path forward. So that remains an area where we will prioritize capital allocation.</p><p>The other -- we're always looking at opportunities externally to add specifically on the gold side. But as you know, things are pretty fully valued out there and a lot of the assets that come up for sale are not always, you know, they'll have various issues technically or locationally or another matter. So we're very disciplined in the way we look at M&amp;A. So another example is this past quarter we made an investment in a Junior and we think there's good value to be had very early in the chain, partnering with Junior's explorers and that forms another key part of our capital allocation.</p><p>So, yes, Molybdenum will remain something we're going to talk about in the near-term here. We continue to look for opportunities in gold and that remains a major strategic focus. And by the drill bit as well, we're going to continue drilling and we're also going to provide updates on our resource models for Goldfield and Mount Milligan by the end of the year and we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing, particularly at Mount Milligan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anita Soni:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, I'll leave it there and get back in the queue. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Raj Ray from BMO. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, Paul and team. My first question is on Mount Milligan. Q2 grades were lower, you did mention it was mine sequencing, but was it lower than what you had expected or it was as per what your mine plan suggested? And then looking at the second half of the year, how should we look at grades for Q3 and Q4? And then also on recovery for gold, slightly lower, should we expect second half recoveries to pick up again like Q1 or do you expect recoveries to hover around these levels? So that's first on Mount Milligan. And then secondly, with respect to the Moly study that's coming up, I understand that once the feasibility study is out, you will decide on what capital to spend, but should we anticipate any spend in Q4 or is this more a 2025 if and when you decide to spend any capital there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Well, Paul will do the Mount Milligan and I'll take over on Langeloth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Okay. Okay. So Mount Milligan, there was a number of questions there. So in Q2, yeah, we had standard mine sequencing and that's why you saw the grades somewhat lower. That being said, in terms of recovery, our gold recovery, we can expect that to go up a little bit. And that's just some of the initiatives that we're doing on our optimization program, we're calling that M Plus. So we can expect to see somewhat higher gold recovery for a number of different reasons. And then in terms of the grade going forward to the remainder of the year, I think the best thing to do is just take a look at our guidance we're on track for that and then that will pan out. But we will expect a little bit higher grades for the remainder of the year, not exceptionally higher. And I think that was the bulk of your questions on Mount Milligan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>All right. So on Molybdenum, Ryan would have mentioned in his prepared remarks that there was some spending in the quarter at Thompson Creek related to early works activities. We continue to do that. So in anticipation of the project study coming out in a few weeks here, we continue to prepare the site for a potential go decision on the project and so there has been some spending and there will continue to be spending here through August and into September as we prepare for a decision there.</p><p>If you want more details, Ryan could speak to that, but perhaps that answers your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>No, that's good.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>I think...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>We will guide the spending for the remainder of the year as part of that release. So if we do go forward, there will be spending, there is spending now. There is early works, as Paul says, it will provide an updated number for the remainder of 2024 with that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raj Ray:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, that's great. Thank you. That's it for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from John Sclodnick from Desjardin. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess looking at Goldfield, it looks like, I guess most of the planned drilling is done. Just wondering if you can give any indication on kind of what you're seeing there, maybe cutoff date for the resource estimate if you're thinking about using the same resource gold price of 1800 or if you might take that up? And how those column leach tests have been going?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So I'll remind -- because we did that pivot on Goldfield, what we're looking for here is a principally run of mine oxide resource, so we had to prove to ourselves two or three key things. One is that we have sufficient oxide material, having temporarily put disulfide on the shelf. We continue to drill and we are adding to our internal view on quantity there and the column leach tests are going extremely well. We're getting recoveries in line with what I would have expected for run of mine Nevada oxide. So those are going very well.</p><p>In terms of drilling, we will do more drilling this year and we will incorporate the remainder of that drilling into our resource estimate. With that resource estimate, we will also put out what the recoveries look like, a high-level view on a flow sheet and then a path forward on engineering and a potential path to execution. Your second question there is, what do we use a higher gold price for the resource at Goldfield, potentially, I mean, it's a relatively low-risk in Nevada, fairly easily digestible project. We haven't made that decision yet, but certainly, I think what you're asking is a good question. We're going through the same logic as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yeah, no, appreciate that color and looking forward to the update there. I guess one other one for me. This is just kind of annoying modeling one, but the depreciation has been trending a bit below guidance and then just wondering if that's going to pick up in the second half or if you're kind of going to be targeting the low end of that depreciation guidance range?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Snyder:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, I think it's probably heading towards the lower end of it. Mount Milligan, with the increase in reserves at the end of last year brings down that depreciation a little bit. It will pick up a bit in the second half of the year as we sell more material at Mount Milligan, but I think we're heading towards the lower end of the range on that, yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Sclodnick:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Appreciate that and, yeah, Raj asked my Mount Milligan question, so good for me. Thanks, guys.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Mike Parkin from National Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, guys. Couple questions for me. Could you first start off, there's quite a few forest fires in BC, are you seeing any impact at site or at risk of being able to move material in or out?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for the question. We pay very close attention to that, of course. At this moment in time, we're actually category two, which is fairly low risk, it's not the lowest category one would be. There was a period of time earlier in the quarter, we were at category three. There were a number of fires. We had the fire in Jasper and some of the other locations, but no, that's not an issue in our locale at Mount Milligan and back in April, we had a fire relatively close to Endako and we were on alert for evacuation there, but that didn't need to happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>And can you just remind us in terms of, like, the forest fire seasonality, is that something that generally kind of continues through Q3 and then as you get into, like probably, I'm guessing kind of late Q3, it dies down in Q4, it's like a non-issue with, like, snowfall?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Well, definitely Q4, it's a non-issue. Best way to answer that is we're in a bit of a different climate change. It's always been out in Western Canada that you had May, June was the high-risk period right after the fresh head. But that being said, we've seen risks right early in April, right on through to August and September in the past. So we're on alert right through.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Last year was a lot worse for us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, BC was worse, but it's also where you are in BC. At this moment in time, it's not as high risk as it has been in the past throughout in the past of this summer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Just circling back like you're making some pretty impressive cost improvement success at Mount Milligan, something you guys certainly were highlighting here some low-hanging fruit on the site tour last year. With respect to the mining cost improvement, can you give us a bit more color on what are the initiatives like focus that? Is it like, I know tire life was, I think, something standing water on roads improvement that seemed like some kind of low-hanging fruit from site tour. Can you just give us some high level of like, where you're focused in the near-term and where you expect to kind of realize those savings?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So there is always some opportunity on consumables like tires and diesel, perhaps a little bit on powder factory, although we got to be very careful on fragmentation since that's the main goal. But the bulk of the gain is going to come from improving the load-haul cycle production and productivity and that's actually already been happening at site. Why we're not seeing in the unit operating costs for the quarter is because we did have some residual costs on equipment, some of the major component changeouts, so it doesn't reflect in the operating costs. And so going forward, it's really going to come from the load-haul cycle itself and improving on all the various components there, that's where the biggest ticket is.</p><p>And then, of course, some of the other items, like the consumables, as you pointed out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>It's like the vision of making the pit bigger, does that -- I remember from site, I think it would, the way I would kind of summarize it was if you guys were specking the equipment, you wouldn't have necessarily picked the equipment that's there now. It would seem kind of the wrong size for the operation. Does that like with this expansion you're talking about in pit size, does that make use of that underutilized scale of the fleet or are you all still looking to like as assets mature in terms of rolling stock, do you look to optimize scale going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, that's a great question. So if you were to start fresh, you might look at a different fleet, of course, probably the biggest one that I would change right away would be the loaders, the use of the loaders, the 994s in the pit, but that's what we're working with. So going forward, we'll optimize those. In terms of the change out of the fleet proper, we need to do the decision to capital allocation decision based on what we have. And for the long-term expansion, of course, there's a number of different options we can take a look at expand -- extending the current fleet, we can take a look at a larger -- a larger truck size, but then, of course, the larger your truck size, you then have to take a look at what the overall productivity is and where you're coming from the different phase events and you have a little bit less optionality on that.</p><p>So we're looking at all these options, but I think the overarching component of our current stock and then going forward, what would make the most sense, you need to take a look at what we have today and use it in your capital allocation, that's far and away the most important variable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Parkin:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, thanks. That's it for me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning and thank you for taking my question. It relates back to the Moly operations and again, the study. You've talked a lot about the potential at Langeloth and it's only working at 30% of capacity. When you come out with the details, I assume we're going to get a Thompson Creek study, which is sort of apples-to-apples to what we did before, but the second part of it at Langeloth, in that analysis, are you just going to assume the integration of Thompson Creek or given I think there's even more excess capacity, does the fact that you can actually put the Thompson Creek stuff in allow you to go out and get more third party material, so we'll not only get the benefit of, you know, the Thompson Creek material over, fixed costs over larger volumes and things like that, but there'll be another uptick. Is that what we're getting on the Langeloth study or to the extent you can comment on that, it'd be helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think you've described the strategy well. One of, I'd say that the most important component of our thinking on the Molybdenum Business Unit, meaning the integrated Thompson Creek-Langeloth operation is that Langeloth is the principal value driver, it's not the only value driver, but it's the principal value driver. And by utilizing that fixed cost leverage and increasing utilization of the capacity there, we not only create a strong EBITDA business, but we also, to a large degree, insulate ourselves from fluctuations in molybdenum price because of the way we would purchase concentrate up from a third party and then sell it onward to the steelmakers.</p><p>So the strategy here is, use Thompson Creek as a significant component of filling the capacity at Langeloth. So as you pointed out, we're roughly running at one-third capacity. In broad brush terms, Thompson Creek would fill the second third, which would then allow us to fill the final third with third-party material and particularly dirtier or higher copper content cons where we can charge a bigger spread, a bigger TCRC because we have the very clean con coming from Thompson Creek.</p><p>When you look at the world of molybdenum, interestingly, the two cleanest cons out there are actually Thompson Creek and Endako. So the Thompson Creek feed the con from there will allow us significant flexibility in blending in order to fill that final third. So, yes, the answer to your question, which you kind of previewed there is, that study will be a standalone mine feasibility study with its accompanying NI 43-101, but we will have an entire other section showing the economics of the integrated whole, Thomas Creek and Langeloth and you will see that the value is generated in significant part by an optimal use of the roasting facility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Right. But just so I'm clear, would that study assume 66% utilization of Langeloth?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>No or you could actually could...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>No, much higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>No.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Right. Yeah. Okay, so you'll be able to do 100, so you'll make assumptions about what you can do on the other side and we'll get to see all that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Precisely, yes. But the important part is that Thompson Creek enables that ramp from 66 to 100 because you now have the clean con that you can blend with higher copper percentage cons. So, yes, we will show a full ramp-up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. And again, just to be clear, as you said, the value add is in treating the dirty cons, it's not like you bring Endako into that something, because it's another clean con. So it's still a total standalone unit that you have to look at going forward if you decide to go down that route, is that fair?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, so I think that if you were to look at this very, very high level strategically, Endako has no place in the plan until Thompson Creek is exhausted. So if you look at a perfect situation here, you run Thompson Creek and then, whatever, 15, 20 years later, you then bring Endako into the mix as the next source of clean con, which you can then use. It would not be good for us to open both together.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian MacArthur:</emphasis></p><p>Great. That's what I thought, but I just wanted to confirm. Thanks very much. That's very, very helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeremy Hoy from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeremy Hoy:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Paul and team, thanks for taking the question. You guys have made some good progress with your optimization study at Mount Milligan, we saw that in your per ton processing costs this quarter. Do you expect to see continuing improvements in the processing throughout the year or have they largely been realized? And then am I correct in assuming that those were not factored in when providing guidance at the beginning of the year for costs for the operation and that's it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Chawrun:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. So first, no, we did not include these gains in our guidance at the beginning of the year and so and to answer your question, are we going to continue to see gains? So this is a very long-term view. And so we had some low-hanging fruit, recycling some of the steel which was a big gain. We're looking at optimization of our concentrate qualities. So that actually improves our overall gold. And so that's why you're seeing some of the gains in the plant. And yes, we're looking at a number of different optimization programs to improve the plant overall, both on recoveries, throughput and also the mine-to-mill because if we can have a steady state and have less disruptions in the plant, then that actually helps the overall costs.</p><p>And then lastly, through the winter, that was a problematic area and we've done quite a lot of gains there. So yes, we can expect to see continuous improvement in the plan, but just overarching. This is a comprehensive program to put Mount Milligan into a world-class operation and this was key for the long-range plan. And so we'll be adopting those operating metrics into the PDA and into the plan itself going forward with these demonstrable improvements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>And I'll use this as an opportunity to plug the PEA. What we're looking at here at Mount Milligan is a very significant potential mine life extension beyond the 2035 reserve, incorporating the drilling that I mentioned earlier. We're doing a lot of drilling, we're getting very good results on that. So we're looking at a resource model update. We're looking at, I'll remind that we're currently capped on reserves with tailings capacity. We're looking at incremental opportunities to store tailings and we're making good progress on that. And lastly, as Paul said, we're incorporating these new operating metrics into the way we look at mine and plant operations for consideration in that study. So things are going well on that study and we're hard at work on it and we still need several months to do that, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeremy Hoy:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thanks for the color and we'll look forward to see further results from that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Tomory:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Jeremy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-e6858a19fa9958128aff9b1eeead18bb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMP-6D93-RYGP-P4WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 AlphaStreet Inc.

Lyon has directed such movies as Species: The Awakening, Zombie Apocalypse, Bullet, Hercules Reborn, Christmas in Vienna, and Operation Dunkirk, among others. Lyon's latest movie is the family drama/natural disaster action flick On Fire, available exclusively in movie theaters starting September 29th, 2023. In this interview, Lyon talks with this writer about making On Fire, working with co-director and On Fire star Peter Facinelli, working with Lance Henriksen, and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">**</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>Bryan Kristopowitz : How did you decide that you wanted On Fire to be your next movie as a director?</p><p>Nick Lyon : Back in 2017, I was camping with my sons and was actually horrified by the notion that we were on a one-road-in camping site, so I started asking myself, 'What would we do to escape if there were a forest fire?' That sparked the idea of doing a movie of a family fleeing a forest fire, which eventually turned into On Fire. The reason I wanted to do the film is kind of the same reason I got into movies in the first place. I wanted to make art that would speak to millions of people and hopefully make a difference in the world. This doesn't always happen with genre films. I see On Fire as a possibility to bring awareness to what people endure in forest fires. 85% of all forest fires are caused by humans, so if watching this film can help people become more vigilant in not starting forest fires then the film will have served its purpose. I believe that showing what a family would go through will give a deeper understanding of how doing something stupid like lighting fireworks in a forest can affect the lives of real people.</p><p>BK : Describe your working relationship with Ron Peer, who co-wrote the script with you. How did you come up with the title On Fire?</p><p>NL : I first met Ron back when I did my first feature film, I Love, You, Baby, starring Maximilian Schell. Ron had written that screenplay, and I was hired to direct it in the German language. I always loved Ron's style of writing since that day because it was very tense and suspense-filled. Over the years, Ron and I became very good friends. We've worked together on other projects, including The Boy, The Dog, and The Clown, which Ron and I co-wrote. In the case of our collaboration on On Fire, I had a treatment that was going to get made and I promised to deliver a script to the financiers in two weeks. I was busy on production prep and finishing another film I was shooting, so I called Ron. I said, 'Hey, are you up to writing this in two weeks? I need it really quick because I'm in the middle of pre-production on another film.' He delivered the first draft based on my story, and we collaborated on the script bouncing ideas back and forth after that. I did my pass, he corrected my pass, I did more work during the shoot, and so on. Ron is more like an author, and I believe he enjoys the process like taking a bath, whereas I have to really have a purpose to enjoy writing otherwise I get a little bored. It's a dynamic partnership. I bring the directorial elements to help him with the writing, and he brings the patience needed by a really good writer to craft a script. It's a good balance.</p><p>BK : How did you cast On Fire? What was it like working with Lance Henriksen?</p><p>NL : The casting process for On Fire was led by casting directors Paul Weber and Tineka Becker. Most of the actors were chosen through auditions, and then I had meetings with them over the phone or via Zoom. I handpicked all of the actors and felt they were the best fit for their roles. I feel I got really lucky with a great cast. Working with Lance Henriksen was amazing. He's such a humble and nice person. I had expected him to be a tough guy, but he turned out to be the nicest guy. He trusted the creative direction of the film and really let himself go with the story. He and Peter Facinelli had a great father-son connection on screen, and all of the actors worked well together.</p><p>Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>BK : Describe your working relationship with On Fire star and co-director Peter Facinelli. How did Peter Facinelli come to be a co-director on the movie?</p><p>NL : We were both co-producers and worked well together. It was from day one a collaborative relationship, as is typical in the creative partnership between a lead actor and a director. Peter is also a filmmaker, which made it even more seamless. He was very on point with his character and loved the script. As co-producers, we both had a very similar vision for how good the finished film would and could become. During the shoot, I tested positive for COVID-19 and we were right before Thanksgiving, so there was no way we could wait for me to clear to be able to return to set because everyone was set to leave for the holidays and had commitments afterward. So it was a blessing that Peter was able to step in to direct on the days I couldn't be on set. Having Peter Facinelli as an ally was a great asset. At the end of the day, I felt Peter deserved a co-directing credit and offered it to him to celebrate our collaboration, which continued well through the post-production period as co-producers and co-directors.</p><p>BK : Where was On Fire made?</p><p>NL : Originally, I planned on shooting in northern California, or Idaho, but as I checked the weather, I realized it might be rainy or very cold (under 30 degrees) at night, which wasn't suitable for a forest fire film and would be tough on the crew, especially with all fire scenes being shot at night. After researching every forest and the temperatures in November, I discovered a pine forest in Bastrop, Texas, near Austin, where the film's financiers were located. Bastrop is also known for forest fires, and the climate was perfect, and there would be no snow, no rain and it would be warmer at night. It also helps that Bastrop is next to Austin, which has a large film and acting community.</p><p>Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>BK : How long did it take to make On Fire, from finishing the screenplay to completing post-production?</p><p>NL : If I start with the very first treatment and inspiration, it goes back to 2017. On Fire became hot in May 2021, and we shot it from October 27 to November 21st, 2021 with a 19-day shooting schedule. Then in 2022, there were a couple of pick-up days as well. It was a fast process compared to some films. Post-production, including animation, took about a year. So, from beginning to end, it's been about a two-year process.</p><p>BK : What was the hardest part of making On Fire for you as a director? What was the easiest?</p><p>NL : Overall, preparing to make a movie is the hardest work. The decisions and architecture of a project set it up to win or fail, from casting to all locations, to wardrobe and crew, these are the ingredients needed to make such a film, and once they are in place, the filming becomes more of a mechanical process from a technical standpoint. And after the actors are a few days into the shoot, and have established who they are, everything just goes smoothly. Where things are difficult is when you are trying to make a recipe and are missing some ingredients. As a director, I believe in being prepared to ensure a film's success.</p><p>The hardest part for me was figuring out how to make the film without actually burning down the entire forest and doing so on a modest budget. While I was developing the idea, many said it would cost millions, but having experience with disaster films and special effects, I knew I could create a system to shoot the film safely and affordably by using a combination of lightning, smoke, real fire, and visual effect enhancements. We ended up leaning on visual effects a bit more than we thought after we discovered that if we used fire bars, the heat was making the ground smolder. That's because the entire forest was covered with pine needles that had decayed into wood soil which was very flammable. So we weren't able to use the large flame bars.</p><p>As for the easiest part, I would say that was the work with the actors. When you cast good actors and give them a good script, which is the roadmap, they just deliver, and staying out of their way is probably the best thing a director can do if everyone is on point. I would give notes, especially blocking and explaining visual effects that they would be looking at, but I always let the actors follow their guts as characters. It's funny how instinctually great actors just know what to do. If they wander off, then you pull them back in, but our cast was very good so that made my life a lot easier. The next easiest was probably waiting for my editor, Dan Money, to finish his editor's cut because I didn't have to do much during that phase.</p><p>Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>BK : How was making On Fire different from making something like Species: The Awakening or Operation Dunkirk?</p><p>NL : The main difference is that I was hired to direct Species and Operation Dunkirk, while for On Fire, I wrote, produced, and directed it myself. It's a significant shift when you create a project from the start. In terms of physical production, Species involved a longer shoot with makeup effects, stunts, and a specific science fiction genre. We shot in Mexico City for about 28 days. Operation Dunkirk was an ultra-low-budget film I was hired to direct, and we had a very small crew, and almost no time (11 days) to shoot although it was a very ambitious script, so I relied a lot on using movie magic tricks of low-budget filmmaking like turning 10 background actors into 50 by reusing them from different angles to give the appearance there are a lot more. On Fire falls in the middle, combining my abilities as a low-budget and larger-budget filmmaker. It was a very ambitious project for its budget and with just 19 days to shoot it was challenging, but having worked in many disaster films before, I knew what was needed to make this film on time and on budget. We didn't go into overtime at all.</p><p>BK : You've worked on a number of TV properties in your career. How has the TV business changed since you started working as a director?</p><p>NL : The TV business has changed a lot. Art house films used to be more common but are less so now. Small films like On Fire rarely get theatrical distribution. TV and independent film budgets aren't increasing; in fact, they are often decreasing. What used to be 10 million is now 4 million, and what used to be 4 million is now 1 million. Production companies are forced to cope with rising costs and diminishing returns by reducing the number of shooting days. In the past, TV movies might have had an 18\u201424 day shooting schedule, but now it's not uncommon to get only 11 to 14 days to make a full 90-minute movie. We need to work very fast nowadays, that's the biggest difference I have seen. You have to know how to work very fast in today's market. There are, of course, larger studio productions that have fairly unlimited budgets and they are still able to afford more shooting days, but in the independent world, that's not the case.</p><p>BK : According to imdb you've directed several Christmas/holiday movies. How did you get involved in directing those types of movies?</p><p>NL : It's fun! Nobody really knows this but I actually started making films with comedy. I did a film called Hilda Humphrey (aka Hellchild) so I've always had a spot in me that is for making comedy. I also have a definite softer side to me that I like to exercise, if not for me, then for my wife and my mother.</p><p>Even within genre films, there are different genres, so it's part of the craft of directing and being able to tell stories in different ways. So doing holiday movies or romantic comedies is a nice break from all the heaviness and darkness that goes along with most genre films. And, really, as a director, I enjoy the challenge of taking on different genres. I don't see why a director should have to only stick to one genre because we are all made up of so many different sides of our personalities, and I actually just enjoy the process of being able to exercise all sides of my personality and create worlds in different genres. All the big actors do different genres. Most actors are not only horror actors or dark genre actors, they can jump between genres, and I feel that that's what I want to do as a director. I enjoy being able to take on different projects with different emotions, different worlds, and different genres, and do them well. My wife doesn't like horror or too much violence, so she loves it when I do a Christmas film. And it makes for great holiday viewing for the family as well.</p><p>Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>BK : Any moviemaking heroes?</p><p>NL : I have to say I am a very big Ridley Scott fan. When I was younger I also really loved David Lynch and other art house directors. One of my all-time favorites, and somebody who I was able to study under in Germany when I was going to film school, is Werner Herzog. Werner Herzog did amazing things with Klaus Kinski and his films in general were insanely ambitious.</p><p>Fitzcarraldo is a film that made a really deep impact on my filmmaking sensibilities. Maybe that's why I like to take on big, impossible-for-the-budget films and still think I can create a blockbuster on a low budget. After all, Werner Herzog was able to move an actual ship over a mountain in Fitzcarraldo.</p><p>BK : Any upcoming projects you can tell us about?</p><p>NL : Right now I am just finishing a screenplay, called The Vessel, which is a sci-fi/action/thriller, and I hope to be able to shoot it in 2024. I will probably shoot an ultra-low budget film that I self-produce, shoot and direct, and I am about to embark on an earthquake movie to continue with the disaster genre.</p><p>BK : What do you hope audiences get out of On Fire?</p><p>NL : I hope that watching On Fire helps people understand the consequences of what can happen if you do something, reckless or unknowingly reckless, like lighting fireworks in the forest or being careless with your forest fire, or throwing a cigarette out of a window or not taking care of the infrastructure to the electric companies. These things all have real consequences. People who are 10 miles away could be put in extreme danger and lose absolutely everything. So the message I would like to convey is that people need to be more vigilant. 85% of all forest fires are man-caused. Unlike other natural disasters, the number of forest fires can be mitigated, so I hope that this film helps people understand this, especially as our climate continues to warm and the forests become dryer and more flammable. We have to be very careful.</p><p>BK : Is Glenn Morshower as cool in real life as he appears onscreen?</p><p>NL : Glen absolutely is as cool as he comes across on screen. And it's still quite fun to go to Universal and see him in the Transformers ride while waiting for your place telling us of the dangers in the mission. I think everybody knows who he is so it's always fun working with great character actors like Glenn. Glenn is an adamant professional.</p><p>Image Credit: Cineverse</p><p>**</p><p>A very special thanks to Nick Lyon for agreeing to participate in this interview and to david j. moore for setting it up.</p><p>On Fire is available exclusively in movie theaters starting September 29th, 2023!</p><p>Check out my review of On Fire  <url normalizedValue=\"https://411mania.com/movies/on-fire-review/\">here</url> !</p><p>Check out the On Fire official Facebook page <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/OnFireMovie2023\">here</url> !</p><p>Check out Nick Lyon's official website <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nicklyon.com/home\">here</url> , official Facebook page <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/nicklyondirector\">here</url> , official Twitter page <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/nicklyonfilm\">here</url> , official Instagram page <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicklyondirector/\">here</url> , and imdb page <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528963/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_q_nick%2520lyon\">here</url> !</p><p>Nick Lyon image courtesy of Nick Lyon.

It had burned for two days through several mountain villages, destroying homes and leaving four people dead. </p><p><br/>Forestry officials said more than 600 people from emergency services and the army worked to fight the fire using a dozen aircraft and 70 fire trucks. The blaze was finally brought under control by water bombing with the help of international aircraft. <br/>Cyprus government spokesperson Marios Pelekanos said that Greece and Israel had each deployed two aircraft Saturday to help fight the blaze. Officials said 11 aircraft from Cyprus were deployed, along with two British helicopters from a nearby UK base. <br/><br/>Firefighters are still deployed around the village of Arakapas to extinguish any further outbreaks. <br/>Interior Minister Nicos Nouris has called the blaze the \"most destructive\" in the history of Cyprus. <br/>What sparked the fire? <br/>The wildfire broke out Saturday in the Troodos mountain range near the village of Arakapa and burned 55 square kilometers (21 square miles) of forest and farmland. Officials said more than 50 homes were destroyed. <br/><br/>The flames were spread quickly by strong winds and forced the evacuation of at least eight mountain villages. <br/>Search and rescue crews in the village of Odou discovered four charred bodies Sunday, belonging to Egyptian laborers who were unable to escape the fire. <br/>A 67-year-old farmer is currently being held in custody by police on suspicion of causing the wildfire. <br/>Police said an eyewitness had seen him leaving Arakapas in his car around the time the fire started. The man denies having started the fire. <br/><br/>wmr/rt (AFP, AP) <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109989162548761678325979100232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:632V-92B1-F03R-N27V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"326\"/><timeReceived>12:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 5, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, let me say, on behalf of myself and the first second gentleman of the United States, my husband, Doug Emhoff. Thank you for the warm welcome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me just say, it's good to be here with all of the friends, all of the leaders who are here. I want to thank former Governor Ed Rendell. Senator Bob Casey, who we will reelect this November. Senator John Fetterman. Mayor Cherelle Parker. And Chairman Jaime Harrison.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it is so good to be here with your incredible Governor Josh Shapiro.</p><p>And I will say, Josh is a dear, dear friend, and an extraordinary leader. He and I have been spending a lot of time together over the years. And I told Josh, look, I am so, so invested in our friendship and doing this together because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania. We will win Pennsylvania.</p><p>And I thank you, Josh. I thank you.</p><p>So, Philadelphia, I launched my campaign for the president of the United States a mere two weeks ago. And it's been a bit of a whirlwind.</p><p>And just last night the delegates to the Democratic National Convention finished voting and so, I stand -- I stand before you today to proudly announce I am now officially the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.</p><p>And so, now, we've got some work to do. We need to move to the general election and win that.</p><p>And to all the friends, listen, we also need to level set. We are the underdogs in this race. But we have the momentum, and I know exactly what we are up against.</p><p>Now, many of you know, before I was elected vice president or elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.</p><p>So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who scammed consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.</p><p>So, hear me when I say. I know Donald Trump's type.</p><p>So, but let me just say, let me say, hold on, hold on, hold on. This campaign, our campaign, is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign, this campaign, is a fight for the future. It's a fight for the future.</p><p>And, Pennsylvania, we fight for a future with affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable child care, paid leave.</p><p>We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy, where every American has the opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.</p><p>We fight for a future where we bring down prices that are still too high, and lower the cost of living for America's families. So that they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead.</p><p>We fight for a future where we defend our most fundamental freedoms, the freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.</p><p>And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body, not having her government tell her what to do.</p><p>So -- I love you, too -- so, here's the thing, here's the thing, since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future.</p><p>A leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward, a fighter for the middle-class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America.</p><p>A promise -- a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all.</p><p>So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader. Governor Tim Walz of the great state of Minnesota.</p><p>So, to those who know him best -- to those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor. To his wife, Gwen, he is a husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, he is a dad. To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz.</p><p>To the people -- to the people of Southern Minnesota, for 12 years, he was congressman. To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. And to his former high school football players, he was coach. Coach. Coach.</p><p>And, in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name, vice president of the United States.</p><p>So, America, for some folks, they're just getting to know Coach Walz's story.</p><p>And I will tell you, he is the proud product of a middle-class family in rural Nebraska. He is a veteran who served our nation in uniform for more than two decades as a member of the Army National Guard. And he went to college on the G.I. Bill. He is someone who long before he entered politics worked as a teacher.</p><p>When Coach Walz's and his wife, Gwen, moved from his native Nebraska to Minnesota nearly 30 years ago, they both took jobs at the local high school. Coach Walz's taught social studies. Gwen taught English.</p><p>After school, Tim was the linebackers coach for the football team where I have heard the stories about he had a knack for using the game of football to teach life lessons. He saw the potential in kids who sometimes didn't even see it in themselves.</p><p>Under those Friday night lights, Coach Walz motivated his players to believe they could achieve anything. And, together, they defied the odds -- hear this now, going from a winless record to the school's first ever state championship. Coach. Coach.</p><p>And I will say and I will add, Tim wasn't only a role model on the football field. Around that same time, Coach Walz was approached by a student in his social studies class. The young man was one of the first openly gay students at the school and was hoping to start a Gay-Straight Alliance.</p><p>At a time -- at a time when acceptance was difficult to find for LGBTQ students, Tim knew the signal that it would send to have a football coach get involved.</p><p>So, he signed up to be the group's faculty adviser. And, as students have said, he made the school a safe place for everybody.</p><p>In the high school yearbook, the students voted Coach Walz the \"most inspiring faculty member.\"</p><p>And, as I think everyone here can see, Tim Walz was the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having and that every kid deserves. The kind of coach, because he's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big, and that's the kind of vice president he will be. And that's the kind of vice president America deserves.</p><p>So, it was Coach Walz's students who actually helped him decide to run for office, and he served 12 years in Congress, representing a purple district, as he reached across the aisle to get things done.</p><p>He was the highest-ranking -- he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in the United States Congress.</p><p>And the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee, and he was known as one of Capitol Hill's best marksmen, winning a bipartisan sharpshooting contest year after year.</p><p>In Washington, Tim worked to raise the minimum wage to protect the freedom of workers to join a union.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: And he passed one of the critical votes to pass the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: Which of course gave health insurance to tens of millions of Americans. I'm going to tell you, when we win, Tim and I will continue to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: We will win! We will win! We will win!</p><p>HARRIS: We will win.</p><p>GOV. TIM WALZ, (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Wow.</p><p>HARRIS: Now, let's talk about what we're dealing with on the other side.</p><p>So, on that last topic, if Donald Trump gets a chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>HARRIS: And take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. Do you remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.</p><p>Well, Governor Walz and I will not let that happen. Because we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it.</p><p>As Governor, Tim has continued to fight for working families. He secured paid leave for workers in Minnesota.</p><p>And he refused -- he refused, as Governor, to allow any student in their public schools to go hungry. So, he made school breakfast and lunch free for every child.</p><p>And Tim Walz and I, we agree about many things, including when our middle class is strong, America is strong.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HARRIS: And strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal as I am president of the United States.</p><p>So, Pennsylvania, ours is a fight for the future of the middle class, and it is a fight for freedom.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: In this moment, we are witnessing a full-on attack against hard- fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. Take reproductive freedom. Now, think about this. Donald Trump said he wants to punish women.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Boo!</p><p>HARRIS: And as a result of his actions today in America, one out of three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban -- one out of three.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Boo.</p><p>HARRIS: Some of these bans go back to the 1800s. Even before women had a right to vote. Think about that. Well, Tim and I have a message for Trump and others who want to turn back the clock on our fundamental freedoms -- we're not going back.</p><p>WALZ: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.</p><p>HARRIS: We're not going back.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: We're not going back. We're not going back. We're not going back.</p><p>HARRIS: And so, let me say about Tim Walz, he has shown up to stand against these attacks long before he stood on the stage with me. After Roe was overturned, he was the first governor in the country to sign a new law that enshrined reproductive freedom as a fundamental right.</p><p>HARRIS: And with Tim Walz by my side, when I am president of the United States and we win majorities in the United States Congress, we will pass a bill to restore reproductive freedom, and I will proudly sign it into law.</p><p>Tim Walz has also defended the sacred freedom to vote. As governor -- as governor, he signed the most significant expansion of voting rights in Minnesota in over 50 years.</p><p>And with Governor Walz's help, when I am president, we are going to finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We're going to get it done.</p><p>So, Tim is a hunter and a gun owner who believes, as the majority of gun owners do, that we need reasonable gun safety laws in America.</p><p>So, as governor, he expanded background checks and increased penalties for illegal firearm sales.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.</p><p>Through his work, Tim, he, you know, the way I think about it, he really does shine a light on a brighter future that we can build together. In his state, he has been a model chief executive. And with his experience, I'm telling you, Tim Walz will be ready on day one.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: In fact -- in fact, when you compare his resume.</p><p>Shall we? To Trump's running mate, well, well, some might say it's like -- It's like a matchup between the varsity team and the J.V. squad.</p><p>So, Pennsylvania, ultimately in this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? A country -- a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?</p><p>And here is the beauty of our democracy. We each have the power to answer that question. We each have the power to answer that question. The power is with the people!</p><p>We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.</p><p>That -- that is how we preserve the promise of America. And after all, you know, the promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother. The other, a son of the Nebraska plains who grew up working on a farm.</p><p>It's the promise of America. Because only in America, only in America, is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House.</p><p>WALZ: Yes!</p><p>HARRIS: Only in America. Only in America.</p><p>Only in America.</p><p>CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!</p><p>HARRIS: That's right. That's right. And so, Coach Walz and I may hail from different corners of our great country, but our values are the same. And we both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down.</p><p>He and I, we both know, the vast majority of people in our country have so much more in common than what separates them.</p><p>When we look at folks, we see in our fellow Americans, neighbors, not enemies. Not enemies.</p><p>And so, my promise to you is this. Our campaign will reach out to everyone, from red states to blue states.</p><p>From the heartland to the coast. In rural, urban, suburban, and tribal communities.</p><p>We are running a campaign on behalf of all Americans. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans.</p><p>And so, with Tim Walz by my side, and with all of you at our side, let us fight for the promise of our future. And, with that, I ask Pennsylvania, are you ready to make your voices heard?</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>HARRIS: Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America?</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>HARRIS: And are we ready to fight for it?</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>HARRIS: And when we fight, we win!</p><p>CROWD: We win!</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>HARRIS: And now, welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>GOV. TIM WALZ, (D) MINNESOTA: Thank you. Wow. Thank you, Philadelphia.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Thank you, Madam Vice President, for the trust you put in me, but maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: I'm thrilled to be on this journey with you and Doug, this incredible journey. And Pennsylvania, I know you know this, but my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Holy hell can this guy bring the fire. He can bring the fire. This is a visionary leader. Also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows, when you need a bridge fixed, call that guy.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: And I think sometimes we forget, and you see people a little one dimensional, but seeing a guy who cares so deeply about his family, a man with compassion, vision. And I have tell you this -- I know this from experience -- there is no one you would rather go a Springsteen concert in Jersey with than him, than that guy.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>CROWD: Bruce!</p><p>WALZ: Bruce!</p><p>And I can't wait for all of you and America to get to know my incredible wife Gwen, a 29-year public school educator.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Don't ever underestimate teachers.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: And our two beautiful kids, Hope and Gus. I couldn't be prouder to be on this ticket and to help Vice President Harris become what we all know is very, very good for us to think about, next president of the United States of America.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: From her first day as a prosecutor, as a district attorney, attorney general of the great state of California, a United States senator, and vice president of the United States.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Vice President Harris has fought on the side of the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: She took on the predators. She took on the fraudsters. She took down the transnational gangs. She stood up against powerful corporate interests, and she never hesitated to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people's lives.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: And I want all of you to hold this, and don't ever underestimate the power of this. She does it all with a sense of joy.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: I know a little something about that commitment to people. I was born in West Point, Nebraska. I lived in Butte, a small town of 400, where community was a way of life. Growing up, I spent the summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us, show generosity towards your neighbors and work toward a common good.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: My dad served in the Army during the Korean War. And with his encouragement, at 17 I joined the Army National Guard.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: For 24 years I proudly wore the uniform of this nation.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: The National Guard gave me purpose. It gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves. And just as it did for my dad and millions of others, the G.I. Bill gave me a shot at a college education.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: My dad was a teacher. My brothers and sisters and I followed in their footsteps. Three out of four of us married teachers.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: It's what we do.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, I had the privilege of teaching high school social studies and coaching football.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Including winning that state championship. Thank you.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Don't ever close the yearbook.</p><p>But it was my students, they encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them, a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference. So, in 2006 -- 2006 I took a leap and I ran for Congress.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had one Democrat since 1892.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALZ: My neighbors graced me with an opportunity to represent them in the United States House of Representatives.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: I'm proud of the work we did there together. I worked across the aisle on veterans' issues, on agriculture, and on ways to grow rural economies. I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: And now as governor of the great state of Minnesota, I bring those experiences to bear in tackling the challenges that are facing our great state. Minnesota's strength comes from our values, our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to always being willing to lend a helping hand. Those are the same values I learned on the family farm and tried to still in my students. I took it to Congress and to the state capital, and now Vice President Harris and I are running to take those very values to the White House.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Now, Donald Trump sees the world a little differently than us.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: First of all, he doesn't know the first thing about service.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: He doesn't have time for it because he is too busy serving himself.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: Again and again and again Trump weakens our economy to strengthen his own hand.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: He mocks our laws. He sews chaos and division. And that's to say nothing of his record as president.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALZ: He froze in the face of the COVID crisis. He drove our economy into the ground. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: That's not even counting the crimes he committed.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: You know, some of us, some of are --</p><p>CROWD: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!</p><p>WALZ: Some of us in here are old enough to remember -- I see you down there. I see those old white guys. Some of us are old enough to remember --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALZ: -- when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor's office.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: In Minnesota we respect our neighbors and their choices that they make.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there is a golden rule -- mind your own damn business.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: These guys are after my heart chanting \"Mind your own damn business.\" That feels good, so thank you.</p><p>Look, that includes IVF. And this gets personal for me and my family. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through infertility treatments. And I remember praying every night for a call for good news. The pit in my stomach when the phone rang and the agony when we heard that the treatments hadn't worked. So it wasn't by chance that when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: When the vice president and I talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: And for our children to be free to go to school without worrying they will be shot dead in their classrooms.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: By the way, as you heard, I was one of the best shots in Congress, but in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense gun violence laws.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Vice President Harris's idea for freedom is a ticket, for education to be that ticket to the middle class, not crippling debt. Air that's clean, water that's pure, communities that are safe.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: -- place where we settle our political differences not through violence, but with our votes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: And that's what this election is about. What direction will this country go in? We're not going back. Well, Donald Trump would damn sure take us backwards. Let's be clear about that.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: And don't believe him what he plays dumb. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will do to restrict our freedoms.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: To rig the economy to help the superrich. If Trump gets a chance to return, he's going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago, only this time it will be much, much worse. Raising costs on middle class family, he will repeal the Affordable Care Act. No doubt about it.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: He'll gut Social Security and Medicare.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: And when somebody tells you who they are, believe them. He said he would ban abortion across this country, and he'll do it whether or not Congress is there or not.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: Donald Trump is not fighting for you or your family. He never set that that kitchen table like the one I grew up at wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat in his country club in Mar-a-Lago wondering how he could cut taxes for his rich friends.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>And I got to tell you, his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda for this country.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: J.D. Vance literally, literally wrote the forward for the architect of the Project 2025 agenda.</p><p>(BOOS)</p><p>WALZ: Like all regular people I grew up with in the heart of land, J.D. studied at Yale --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALZ: -- had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That's not what middle America is. And I got tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: You see what I did there?</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: I got to tell you, pointing out just an observation of mine that I made. I just have to say it. You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy, and, yes, just weird as hell. That's what you see. That's what you see.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: So you know what's out there, so say it with me. We aren't going back!</p><p>CROWD: We aren't going back!</p><p>WALZ: We aren't going back!</p><p>CROWD: We aren't going back!</p><p>WALZ: We aren't going back!</p><p>CROWD: We aren't going back!</p><p>WALZ: We are not going back!</p><p>CROWD: We aren't going back! We aren't going back! We aren't going back!</p><p>WALZ: So we got 91 days. My God, that's easy. We'll sleep when we're dead.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Over those next 91 days and every day in the White House, I'll have Vice President Harris's back, every single day. And we'll have yours.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WALZ: You know how this works. We can't do it alone. We need you, each and every one of you.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Go over to KamalaHarris.com, get on board, because we need you. Free to make our own choices. This leader, this compassionate, careful, joyous leader believes in each and every one of you.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: My God, you came here tonight to sit at the very top because you love this country, and you're not going back.</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: She believes in the opportunity for every single person to join the middle class. She believes in the promise of America. We just got to fight. We just got to fight. Because, as soon-to-be President Harris says, when we fight, we win!</p><p>CROWD: We win!</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>WALZ: Thank you, Philadelphia, thank you, Vice President, God bless America!</p><p>(CHEERING)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Vice President Kamala Harris and her just- chosen nominee, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the rollout in Philadelphia, a packed crowd there as Vice President Harris introducing her new running mate, talking about his history as a hunter, as a football coach, as a veteran, and as a congressman and a governor, Packaging him in very moderate sounding tones. and, obviously, Republican critics point to his governing in Minnesota as much more progressive.</p><p>This is a packed house here in Philadelphia, and an excited democratic base that is ready to move this ticket forward. Obviously, Republicans have a lot to say about the policies that they are putting forward, talked about some of them in these speeches tonight. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy is traveling with the vice president, is there at the rally. Good evening, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. And can you see that the vice president and her new running mate have entered the little buffer area to take some photos. That is something that we have not seen any of the major candidates do since the assassination attempt on President Trump. Security obviously big.</p><p>And everything that we have seen in this room for the last couple hours proves President Biden right. When he dropped out, he explained that part of the reason is that he thought there was a time for new voices to come forward. And there are 10,000 people here, Democrats, young people from the Philadelphia area who are very excited about this ticket in a way that they were not at Biden events that we were going to before Biden dropped, Harris rose, and announced Walz today.</p><p>This event did not have much to do with what Republicans are talking about which are some of Walz's very progressive positions. It was very biographical. And then the Democratic platform that they put forward was pretty boilerplate. They will protect abortion access, protect the Affordable Care Act, increase gun control, call J.D. Vance weird, and stop Trump. That's what we are going to hear a lot of in the next couple of weeks as the ticket has now been officially debuted here in Philadelphia. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: The big rollout obviously coming up in the Chicago convention for the DNC. Peter Doocy live in Philadelphia. Peter, thank you.</p><p>Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance is on his own battleground state tour. He appeared in Philadelphia a few hours before the Democrats arrived. Congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie is also in Philadelphia tonight with that part of the story. Good evening, Aishah.</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. The Trump-Vance team is really trying to frame this brand-new Democratic ticket as an appeasement to the far left. In fact, they came out pretty strong and hard today with a brand-new attack ad calling Tim Walz a, quote, \"leftwing extremist.\"</p><p>And it comes as J.D. Vance was in Philadelphia today rallying here on the ground. He has been following -- he's going to follow the Harris-Walz campaign across seven of the swing states this week.</p><p>Now, some in the GOP do feel that these states are now still in play, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and that the down ballot races are also in play as well. A source tells FOX News that Senate Republicans were actually relieved today with the pick of Walz because Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, they were nervous that those two picks could really cost them those two states.</p><p>Now, with that, some Republican voters in a state say that Trump and Vance really need to start focusing and sticking to those kitchen table issues, not personal attacks, so we know for those moderates and independents.</p><p>And Bret, finally, as far as a possibly vice presidential debate, Vance says that he is ready to go toe to toe with Walz. But he doesn't want to get into specifics until the DNC is over and Walz is officially the vice presidential nominee. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: Aishah Hasnie live in Philadelphia. Aishah, thank you.</p><p>Let's go to the markets. Stock markets rallied after Monday's big selloff. The Dow was up 294. The S&amp;P 500 gained 54. The Nasdaq jumped 167.</p><p>Let's look at Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's economic record and what this ticket may mean for the economy. Charles Payne from FOX Business joins us now. He hosts \"Making Money with Charles Payne.\" Charles, good to see you.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: Good to see you.</p><p>BAIER: You sat through this speech. You've kind of looked at how this ticket has formed. What's your thought on how it may play?</p><p>PAYNE: It's ironic because a lot of the things I heard from both the current vice president and vice president nominee were, it seems like they were being articulated against the current administration. I heard Walz mention debt, and, of course, our debt level is through the roof, and at this very moment we are spending at breakneck speed. In fact, we are spending now the kind of spending a government does, that we have done historically only in war time.</p><p>And then, of course, the notion of the wealthy or the rich doing much better under Republicans, Bret, let me tell you right now, the wealthy have never had it so good as to right now. They have made more money because of President Biden than at any time in history, in part because of all the -- when you put trillions of dollars into the economy -- and you do it for two reasons. A, you know people are going to get these checks and spend it. B, you know they are going to spend more than they get. So you give them $1,400 bucks, they're going to spend $2,400 bucks.</p><p>And where does that money eventually go? To the top one percent. And that's who has benefited. They have benefited the most from high interest rates. They get dividend checks. They have bonds. Everyone else, the 80 percent of America out there, all they get is higher credit card rates.</p><p>BAIER: You know, it was interesting to hear a couple of things. One was a lot of focus on personality and bio and less about policy. But, also, Tim Walz coming out and saying that Kamala Harris brought the joy back.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>BAIER: Poor Joe Biden didn't have any joy, I guess, in his race.</p><p>You had somebody on his show that said this is following a 1970s script about inflation, about heavy regulation, and how the impact of those policies effects the market and people's economy at home.</p><p>PAYNE: And also, the central issue now, how does it affect the Federal Reserve? I know the federal reserve usually goes over people's heads. But they are in charge of taming inflation. That's their job. And they are having a hard time doing it because their other job is making sure that we have what they call maximum employment. How do you do one? One, you have to -- to quell inflation is like putting out a forest fire. You have to do serious damage. If you ever see firemen arrive to building, they don't care. They are breaking down buildings, they're breaking windows. They have to break things. The Federal Reserve has to break things and at the same time hope they don't break them too much. And they've never had this sort of dilemma before because there has never been this amount of money poured into an economy.</p><p>And again, it's so skewed because economists look at it. Imagine a bucket. Let's say we fill a bucket and put it on a scale. And economists will say, wow, that's a heavy bucket. It's a strong economy. And then imagine the same bucket, all of the water is on 20 percent of the side of the bucket. The economists are looking at the scale and saying it's still a strong bucket. When you look inside, 80 percent is bone dry. Bone dry. That's the American public right now. But the economists don't know how to tackle this. How do you tackle this situation? They have never been faced with it before.</p><p>BAIER: It's fascinating. And we appreciate --</p><p>PAYNE: By the way, that jobs report Friday was the first major red flag, but I think there's going to be a whole lot more. It was a very disappointing number.</p><p>BAIER: Yes. Charles, we appreciate it.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks.</p><p>BAIER: Thank you.</p><p>BAIER: Well, presidential candidates will have to answer questions about the Middle East, and its' very tense over there. Chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst joins us from Haifa, Israel. He has a book coming out this fall about the October 7th Hamas massacre. It's called \"Black Saturday.\" And with that comes a new title as well. Trey, it's great to see you. Good evening. I think this is a very tense time. I had the former Israeli prime minister on \"THE STORY\" this afternoon, saying they expect Iran to attack somewhere, some way in the next 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bret, exactly. The attack from Iran could be just hours away. And the region is bracing for the possibility of this unraveling quickly. Local media is reporting tonight the Israeli military is considering a preemptive strike against Iran's largest proxy in the region, Hezbollah, that sits just about 17 miles from where we are standing right now. Earlier today there was yet another drone attack in the northern part of this country, injuring a number of people.</p><p>And as we look forward about how all of this is going to end, the Israelis are looking very close at the November election. They understand that Vice President Harris and the Biden administration says the only way out of in rising tension is a ceasefire, but the Israelis say before any sort of ceasefire takes place, there will be offensive action as they brace for this attack from Iran and what the Israeli response will be. In \"Black Saturday\" we discuss how this war began back on October 7th and the days just after. Bret?</p><p>BAIER: We look forward to the book, and obviously we will be tuning in very closely to see what happens over there in Israel. Trey, thank you.</p><p>Obviously, we took this rollout of the new Democratic ticket, Vice President Harris choosing Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and that rollout in Philadelphia, as we did when former President Trump chose J.D.

We`re tracking the forecast.</p><p>The CBS EVENING NEWS starts now.</p><p>We are coming on the air with a number of developing stories across the U.S., notably, the dangerous weather and scorching heat in much of the country.</p><p>Good evening. I`m Norah O`Donnell, and thank you for being with us.</p><p>But we`re going to begin tonight right here in Washington, with the president of the United States, Joe Biden, facing a fresh round of questions about his health. Eleven days after his disastrous debate performance, CBS News has learned a Parkinson`s specialist from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center has visited the White House at least eight times over the last year.</p><p>Tonight, the president`s press secretary saying Biden is not being treated for Parkinson`s. This is a critical week for the 81-year-old president, with dozens of world leaders in the nation`s capital for a high-stakes summit, NATO summit. House Democrats will meet tomorrow and discuss Biden`s future as the Democratic nominee.</p><p>CBS` Ed O`Keefe is at the White House with new reporting.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE (voiceover): The White House today facing repeated questions about President Biden`s medical history.</p><p>KARINE JEAN-PIERRE (White House Press Secretary): Has the president been treated for Parkinson`s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson`s? No, he`s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson`s? No.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: But the press secretary refused to confirm that Dr. Kevin Cannard, an expert on Parkinson`s disease, visited the White House eight times from last summer to this past spring. Public White House visitor logs show Cannard also met at least once with the president`s personal physician.</p><p>PRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: It is. You`re asking me --</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Did Dr. Kevin Cannard come to the White House?</p><p>PRESS SECRETARY KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I cannot -- (inaudible) I also said to you -- Ed, I also said to you, for security reasons, we cannot share names. We cannot share names.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Those questions came as the president lashed out at critics saying he should exit the race.</p><p>(Audio clip from Morning Joe, MSNBC)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I am not going anywhere. I wouldn`t be running if I didn`t absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024. We had a Democratic nominating process, where the voters spoke clearly.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: President Biden blasted the -- quote -- \"elites\" who he says want him out.</p><p>(Audio clip from Morning Joe, MSNBC)</p><p>PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If any of these guys don`t think I should run, run against me.</p><p>JOE SCARBOROUGH (MSNBC Host): Yeah.</p><p>PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Go ahead. Announce for -- announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: Washington state Democrat Adam Smith was one of four top House Democrats who called for the president to step aside on a private conference call Sunday night.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SMITH (D-Washington): We would be better off with another nominee, OK? I believe that in my heart, my soul, my brain. I`m 100 percent convinced of that.</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: In a letter to House Democrats, the president acknowledged the growing dissent and said: \"It`s time for it to end.\"</p><p>First Lady Jill Biden, seen as the only confidant who could ever convince her husband to step aside, agreed.</p><p>JILL BIDEN (First Lady of the United States): Joe has made it clear that he`s all in. That`s the decision that he`s made. And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in, too.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ED O`KEEFE: But a growing number of Senate Democrats are also raising doubts about the president`s fitness to run again.</p><p>He`s set to speak with black lawmakers tonight to shore up their support. And, tomorrow, he begins hosting the NATO summit here in Washington. The eyes of the world will be on him -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Ed O`Keefe from the White House, thank you very much.</p><p>Now to the devastating impact of Beryl across Texas. This tropical storm is different. It is still lashing the Lone Star State, and power has been knocked out to millions. And flooded roadways have left drivers in need of rescue.</p><p>CBS` Janet Shamlian is in Houston tonight.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN (voiceover): Beryl hammered the Texas coast, making landfall early this morning --</p><p>MAN #1: We are here in the eye of this storm.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: -- unleashing punishing winds and torrential rain. There was widespread flooding and power outages for almost three million customers, the storm battering downtown Houston.</p><p>MAN #2: Oh, my God.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: Rain bands lashing the city`s skyscrapers.</p><p>In Sargent Beach, near where Beryl roared ashore, this trailer home almost submerged.</p><p>Omar Villafranca rode out the storm on Galveston Island.</p><p>OMAR VILLAFRANCA: After Beryl made landfall, the storm brought high winds and possible tornadoes, like the one that hit here, destroying this one home on stilts.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: Elsewhere, people abandoned their cars on flooded freeways. In Harris County, two people were killed when trees fell on their homes.</p><p>JOHN WHITMIRE (D-Mayor of Houston, Texas): Shelter in place. We`re in an emergency. We`re in a rescue mode.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: Tonight, officials are begging people to stay home to avoid rescues like this after a man drove into high water and firefighters had to respond at the height of the storm.</p><p>And now the cleanup.</p><p>JOE GIBBONS (Storm Victim): Heard a sound cracking, and then a loud boom.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: Joe Gibbons (sp?) showed us the 60-year-old tree that came down within feet of him.</p><p>This is a massive tree.</p><p>JOE GIBBONS: It is.</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: What are you going to...</p><p>JOE GIBBONS: It`s withstood a lot of hurricanes. And if this was a Category 1, I would hate to think what it would have been like had it stayed a 4 and made landfall.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JANET SHAMLIAN: This Houston bayou rose 25 feet today in just six hours.</p><p>Beyond all the water, there are still significant power outages across this region and debris and litter and trees blocking roads and street -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Janet Shamlian, thank you very much.</p><p>Now let`s bring in CBSTexas chief meteorologist Scott Padgett with where Beryl is headed next.</p><p>Good evening, Scott.</p><p>SCOTT PADGETT: Hey. Good evening, Norah.</p><p>Beryl right now in East Texas, still a tropical storm, continuing to weaken. But you can see on the satellite and radar, we`re not done with Beryl yet, outer bands stretching down into the Gulf. And the flooding threat continues, as we go into the evening hours, and a number of tornado warnings continuing through parts of Louisiana and also into Arkansas.</p><p>We have been telling you about the flooding, in some spots, nine inches, to near a foot of rain down near Houston. And Beryl, as it weakens overnight tonight to a tropical depression, then a post-tropical cyclone, will affect 11 states, with flooding rains, maybe four to six inches of rain, as it continues that northeasterly track over the next few days.</p><p>The other big story, the heat. On both sides of the United States, we`re dealing with heat alerts, the Pacific Northwest, temperatures in the triple digits. And it`s going to continue to get worse as we go through the next couple of days. That heat dome will continue to expand its way to the east, feels-like temperatures even in the Northeast possibly feeling like the triple digits.</p><p>So, Norah, this heat dome adding to the excessive heat we have been dealing with for the past few days.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Scott Padgett, thank you.</p><p>The scorching temperatures have turned deadly out West, as firefighters struggle to battle dozens of wildfires.</p><p>CBS` Carter Evans reports on the heat that`s smashing records across the country.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>CARTER EVANS (voiceover): An explosive wildfire continues to burn out of control in Santa Barbara County. It`s already ravaged more than 20,000 acres, and the flames are now threatening Michael Jackson`s famous Neverland Ranch, coming within a mile of the pop star`s former estate.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Northern California, 13 hikers missing during a forest fire were found by deputies earlier today. In Southern Utah, this fire doubled in size in less than 24 hours, making it difficult to fight as it beared down on the tiny town of Marysvale.</p><p>WOMAN #1: Pretty scary how it went from 5,000 acres, and here we are, we`re already over 10,000 acres.</p><p>CARTER EVANS: The extreme heat is also breaking records. It was 120 degrees in Las Vegas on Sunday. That`s the hottest day ever recorded, and it`s sending people to the emergency room.</p><p>DR. SYED SAQUIB (Medical Director, UMC Lions Burn Care Center): We call it our pavement burn season.</p><p>CARTER EVANS: When it gets this hot, pavement and other surfaces get even hotter. And doctors say that can cause severe burns.</p><p>One hundred and sixty-three degrees.</p><p>How long does it take for someone to get burned when the pavement`s that hot?</p><p>DR. SYED SAQUIB: In just a few seconds, you can get a second-degree burn from that. And in a few minutes, you can get a third-degree burn. So it doesn`t take very long at all.</p><p>CARTER EVANS: In Phoenix, there`s been an 84 percent increase in possible heat-related deaths so far this year. And in California`s Death Valley, a motorcyclist died from heat exposure over the weekend. But, despite the dangers, visitors turned out to experience the valley`s 129 degrees on Sunday.</p><p>WOMAN #2: It`s definitely shocking. I don`t know how anything can survive out here.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>CARTER EVANS: Now, about half the patients at the burn center at University Medical Center are there right now because of pavement burns. The tourists have to be really careful out here.</p><p>It`s 113 degrees in the shade, but accidentally lean up against this post, that`s 141 degrees -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Wow. Carter Evans, thank you very much.</p><p>Tonight, Ukraine is reeling after a ruthless Russian missile attack on a children`s hospital in the capital city of Kyiv. Nearly 40 civilians were killed and more than 170 injured in missile strikes all across Ukraine.</p><p>CBS` Ramio -- Ramy Inocencio tonight has disturbing images of the aftermath.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>RAMY INOCENCIO (voiceover): More than 40 different kinds of Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine`s capital and four other cities.</p><p>This projectile, slowed down for clarity, unmistakable in this morning`s rare daylight assault, which devastated apartments, office buildings and the country`s biggest pediatric hospital in Kyiv. Rescuers carried out cancer patients, as other children fled still connected to intravenous drips.</p><p>\"I could not think there could be attacks on the hospital with sick children,\" said this mother.</p><p>\"No words, even swear words, can describe it, but what matters most is that they`re alive,\" said this father of his wife and son.</p><p>Volunteers frantically sifted through the rubble of what once was the hospital`s dialysis department looking for survivors. Russia denied it targeted the hospital. Ukraine said it found remnants of a Russian cruise missile.</p><p>(PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY speaking in foreign language)</p><p>RAMY INOCENCIO: \"Beyond any doubt, we are going to answer these savages from Russia,\" said Ukraine`s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visiting neighbor in Poland.</p><p>Russia targeted Zelenskyy`s hometown of Kryvyi Rih too, killing nearly a dozen people and injuring almost four times as many. Today`s deadly Russian barrage across eastern and Central Ukraine raises questions about the country`s air defenses one day before Zelenskyy meets NATO leaders in Washington to discuss how to strengthen them.</p><p>Ramy Inocencio, CBS News, London.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Now a look at tonight`s other top stories, starting with a spike in violence across the country over the July Fourth holiday.</p><p>CBS` Charlie De Mar is in Chicago, where the mayor says the city is in a state of grief.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>CHARLIE DE MAR: Norah, it was a violent holiday weekend here in Chicago.

According to news reporting out of Nagpur, India, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Localization in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is gaining a lot of attention from the researchers due to its usefulness in many real-time applications to identify the source of events. Wireless sensor networks are also utilized to transmit multimedia data such as audio, video and images along with scalar data.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the Department of Computer Engineering, \"This type of WSN is termed as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN). Many applications exist, such as battlefields, environmental monitoring, ecosystem monitoring, and forest fire detection, among others, where the source of an event's occurrence is critical. As a result, using simulations or simulating real-time scenarios, researchers have developed various techniques for locating sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents the clustering-based localization strategies for WSN and WMSN in detail. In a wireless sensor network and wireless multimedia sensor networks, clustering is utilized to offer distributed computing and parallel processing by grouping sensor nodes into small subgroups that operate independently. To improve the performance of the traditional localization procedure, clustering techniques might be greatly useful. Clustering divides the network into partitions which can independently function thus reducing the communication cost. Clustering also increases the throughput of the network by providing distributed computing.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Furthermore, future concerns and issues are highlighted in order to determine the future study direction for new wireless sensor network researchers.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Localization In Wireless Sensor Networks and Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks Using Clustering Techniques.

The area threatened by the fire in Sichuan province is thinly populated, but there was no estimate on how many people were leaving the evacuation zone. State media have described villages, a school, a chemical plant and other places as under threat. </p><p>It wasn't exactly clear when the deaths occurred, but an information officer in the city of Xichang was cited as saying the fire started on a farm yesterday afternoon and quickly spread to nearby mountains due to strong winds. It said one of those killed was a guide and the rest were firefighters. An emergency evacuation was initiated, and more than 300 professional firefighters and another 700 militiamen were sent to help, while Xinhua said another 885 firefighters from other cities in Sichuan were being deployed to Xichang, along with 142 fire engines, six remote water supply systems and extensive firefighting equipment. It said drones would be used to monitor the fire's progress. Along with fighting the flames and evacuating residents, those forces have also been deployed to protect key industrial infrastructure. Almost exactly a year ago in the same area, a blaze high in the rugged forested mountains killed 30 people, 27 of them firefighters and three helpers. That was China's worst death toll among firefighters since 2015, when an explosion at a chemical warehouse in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and other first responders. Like many countries, China has seen a greater number of more deadly forest fires as a result of climate change, habitat destruction and human encroachment into formerly wild areas. Weak industrial safety standards and enforcement has also led to frequent deadly accidents. -- Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSH-71X1-JBSK-R18P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 31, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Army clearing machinery and volunteers are supporting efforts on the ground. <br/> Nearly 300 firefighters battled throughout the night to keep the fire contained Photo: AFP / Louisa GOULIAMAKI  <br/> The state civil protection agency on Thursday had said hundreds of people had been evacuated from over a dozen villages and hamlets in the surrounding area, as well as from local monasteries. <br/>Two more hamlets were evacuated on Friday as a precaution, a fire spokeswoman told AFP. <br/>To indicate the speed of the fire, Hardalias said it had crossed 10.3 kilometres (6.4 miles) in less than five hours on Thursday. <br/> Officials said a number of properties have been destroyed in the blaze Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Fire-fighting efforts have been complicated by the lack of access roads in some areas. <br/> Several Greek villages have been evacuated as firefighters battle the country's first major blaze of the year on a mountain range overlooking the Gulf of Corinth. Six villages and two monasteries were evacuated after the fire broke out near the village of Schinos, some 90 kilometres (56 miles) west of Athens. Photo: AFPTV / Will VASSILOPOULOS  <br/>\"The fire got to within five kilometres of Megara\" on Thursday, a local resident told Skai TV, referring to a nearby coastal town. <br/>\"Vineyards, cottages, crops have been burned, it's a total disaster... many of my friends have had their homes burned,\" he said. <br/>\"We were here (last) night. By around 9:10 pm (1810 GMT) the game was lost, flames were leaping five metres high. We had to leave, and we came back at two in the morning,\" another man told Skai near the remains of his home, some embers still smoking. <br/>Officials said a number of properties have been destroyed, but declined to give precise figures before the fire was extinguished completely. <br/>The blaze started late on Wednesday in the Corinthian Gulf village of Schinos, apparently by someone burning vegetation in an olive grove, the civil protection agency said. <br/>Smoke from the fire choked Athens on Thursday with ash falling from the sky. <br/>The national observatory in Athens said the smoke had reached the Cycladic islands as far as Ikaria. The health ministry recommended people limit physical activity and close doors and windows. <br/>\"We could say the atmosphere (on Thursday) was 10 times more toxic\" than usual,\" observatory senior researcher Nikos Michalopoulos told Open TV. <br/>Wildfires pose a challenge for Greece every year during the dry summer season, with strong winds and temperatures frequently exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/>Hardalias on Friday said the Geraneia mountains fire broke out relatively early in the season, around a month before Greece has scheduled to have its water bomber fleet at full strength on June 15. <br/>In 2018, 102 people died in the coastal resort of Mati, near Athens, in Greece's worst ever fire disaster. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162160833726325876100198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R7-NXV1-JCMN-Y0F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><timeReceived>2:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 21, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX126</classCode><className>ATHENS, GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A CAF Liaison Officer is already integrated into the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre to help assess the situation and assist with planning efforts.</p><p>CAF resources will be provided for an initial period of three weeks, with a one-week possible extension.</p><p>In addition to the CAF deployment, the federal government is also providing the following supports:</p><p>As a member of the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), Parks Canada collaborates with other Canadian fire management agencies to provide support to our partners across the country and internationally when they require assistance by providing specialized equipment and wildland fire management personnel. Parks Canada currently has resources deployed to support various partner agencies and will continue to coordinate with CIFFC on all future requests for resource.</p><p>Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is prepared to provide contracting support to the Province for supplies and logistics.</p><p>Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is prepared to support impacted Canadians with enhanced Service Canada hours, outreach to evacuees, and deployment of mobile outreach to evacuation centres to support applications for services, such as employment insurance. ESDC is prioritizing employment insurance claims for those impacted. Additional procedures are in place to facilitate employment insurance claims where employers are not able to issue records of employment or where paper cheques may not be deliverable as a result of emergency situations.</p><p>Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) continues to support affected First Nations through the Emergency Management Assistance Program (EMAP). Through EMAP, ISC keeps in close contact with affected First Nations and can advance funds or reimburse them for eligible expenses as needs are identified during daily communications with leadership and other partners, such as tribal councils as well as with the province.</p><p>Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) National Emergency Strategic Stockpile (NESS), is engaged and standing by to assist with the delivery of any additional resources that can be leveraged.</p><p>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) regional staff are on the ground and working with the province and telecommunications service providers to keep people connected.</p><p>Health Canada has deployed six air quality monitors to Nova Scotia to provide additional air quality monitoring capacity during emergency response efforts.</p><p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as Nova Scotia's provincial police service, has been engaged in the response to the wildfires since the outset by assisting with evacuation efforts and road closures, publicly communicating vital public safety information, proactively patrolling communities to ensure safety and adherence to mandatory evacuation orders, and providing assistance to all partner agencies involved.</p><p>Transport Canada (TC) will work with provincial officials to better understand the needs for potential flexibility in federal regulations to address any gaps in emergency firefighting and evacuations while ensuring aviation safety is maintained. TC has issued one Notice to Airmen in support of aerial forest fire suppression in Nova Scotia and will continue to support the efforts of the authorities in order to ensure the safety of aerial operations.</p><p>The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) currently has response personnel and assets deployed to provide support to the Province of Nova Scotia in the form of Mobile Incident Command Post trailers, crew support trailers and helicopters for airlifts and aerial surveillance.</p><p>Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) will continue providing weather forecasting capabilities to the Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office.</p><p>The Government of Canada is also assessing what additional resources can be made available through other federal departments and agencies.</p><p>In addition to these supports, the Government of Canada is establishing a donation matching program with the Province of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Red Cross to support Canadians who have been impacted by wildfires in the province.</p><p>The Government Operations Centre is working to coordinate the federal response to the wildfire situation in Nova Scotia and across the country.

Welcome to the Trican Well Service second-quarter 2024 earnings results conference call and webcast. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Brad Fedora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Trican Well Service Limited. Please go ahead, Mr. Fedora.</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIRECTOR, TRICAN WELL SERVICE LTD: Thank you very much for joining us, and good morning, everyone. First, Scott Matson, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the quarterly results. And then I will provide some comments with respect to the quarter, current operating conditions, and our outlook for the future. We'll then open up the call for questions. We have several members of our executive team here in the room and are available to answer any questions that anybody may have. I'll now turn the call back to Scott.</p><p>SCOTT MATSON, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, TRICAN WELL SERVICE LTD: Thanks, Brad. So just before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements and other information based on current expectations or results for the company. Certain material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing conclusions or making projections are reflected in the forward-looking information section of our MD&amp;A for Q2 2024.</p><p>A number of business risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements and our financial outlook. Please refer to our 2023 annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a more complete description of business risks and uncertainties facing Trican. This document is available on our website and on SEDAR.</p><p>During this call, we will refer to several common industry terms and use certain non-GAAP measures, which are more fully described in our Q2 2024 MD&amp;A. Our quarterly results were released after close of market last night and are available both on SEDAR and our website.</p><p>So with that, I'll do a brief summary of our results for the quarter. My comments will draw comparisons mostly to the second quarter of last year, but I'll also provide a bit of commentary about our quarterly activity and our expectations going forward.</p><p>Trican's results for the quarter compared to last year's Q2 were generally stronger due to a busier and less severe spring break-up. We saw an increase in operating activity compared to last year as some of our customers completed their programs that they had previously deferred from Q1 of 2024. And other customers accelerated some of their programs that were scheduled for the second half of 2024 in order to mitigate some of the potential summer water constraints and access concerns regarding seasonal forest fires that they've experienced in prior years.</p><p>Revenues for the quarter were $211.8 million with adjusted EBITDA of $40.7 million or 19% of revenues, both up approximately 20% from last year. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter came in at $45.2 million or 21% of revenues. To arrive at EBITDAS, we add back the effects of cash settled share-based compensation recognized in the quarter to more clearly show the results of our operations and remove some of the financial noise associated with the changes in our share price as we mark-to-market these items.</p><p>On a consolidated basis, we continue to generate positive earnings, generating $16.2 million in the quarter, which translates to $0.08 per share, both on a basic and fully diluted basis. Trican generated free cash flow of $20.9 million during the quarter. Our definition of free cash flow is essentially EBITDAS less nondiscretionary cash expenditures which include maintenance capital, interest, current tax, and cash settled stock-based comp. You could see more details on this in the non-GAAP measures section of our MD&amp;A.</p><p>CapEx for the quarter totaled $25.9 million, split between maintenance capital of about $14 million and upgrade capital of $11.9 million. Our upgrade capital was dedicated mainly to the electrification of ancillary frac equipment and ongoing investments to maintain the productive capability of Trican's active equipment.</p><p>Balance sheet remains in great shape. We exited the quarter with positive working capital of approximately $148.4 million including cash of $36 million. And as anticipated, our cash position decreased compared to year-end with some of the major factors as follows: working capital decreased by $4.8 million as working capital unwound, combined with the effects of spring breakup on operating activity. Tax payments were a combined $49.6 million, and I would note that $36.4 million of that related to our 2023 tax bill that was outstanding, which we telegraphed throughout 2023; the remainder related to our ongoing installment program for 2024.</p><p>NCIB funding was $43.8 million during the year, $27.2 million of that during the quarter. And our dividend payment was $18.3 million in the year, $9 million for this quarter.</p><p>With respect to our return of capital strategy, we repurchased and canceled 6.2 million shares under our NCIB program in the quarter. And subsequent to Q2 of 2024, we've purchased back and canceled an additional 2.4 million shares and continue to be active with our buyback program as we move towards its renewal in October.</p><p>As noted in our press release, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.045 per share, reflecting approximately $8.6 million in aggregate payment to shareholders. Distribution is scheduled to be made on September 30, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2024. And I would note that those dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income tax purposes.</p><p>So with that, I'll turn things back to Brad.</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Okay. Thanks. My comments will include the quarter and then current and forward-looking observations then will be quite similar to our last conference call as not a whole lot has changed since May.</p><p>Overall, Q2 was better than expected. We continue to be pleasantly surprised that our customers continue to level load their programs throughout the year. I actually expect our past experiences with Q2 breakup is a thing of the past. And I think it's reasonable to expect that in the future, the second quarter will generate positive earnings in our industry. which is a refreshing change. And then we'll -- in exchange, we'll see more of a slowdown at the end of Q4 in and around Christmas.</p><p>As always, there was lots of weather and spring thaw delays throughout the quarter, but nothing that wasn't typical. And overall, like I said, the quarter went very well. Certain of our customers moved Q3 work forward into Q2 to avoid potential water restriction issues that are just the result of ongoing drought conditions in Western Canada. And so that was a significant help to our quarter, but this will come at a cost to our Q3 results. So the work does move around from quarter to quarter. That's nothing to be concerned about.</p><p>Frac revenue was up 30% year over year, and EBITDA in that division was up over 50%. So a very successful quarter in our frac division.</p><p>In general, I would say cost inflation has basically stopped or is very muted. In fact, there are pockets of -- there are areas where we're starting to see some of our costs actually decrease. So that's a welcome change to the past few years, and that helps with -- offset a lot of the pricing pressure that we've been experiencing over the last six months.</p><p>We are still operating seven frac crews. We commissioned our fifth Tier 4 fleet earlier in the year, which is -- which was designed to operate in the Duvernay and the high-pressure areas of the Montney. I think we still are taking a very disciplined approach to the basin, and we are operating about 60% of our total horsepower compared to our competitors that are running full blast. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the industry, and we will bring back equipment as required and at a time when we think we can generate return on all of the hours that it's operating.</p><p>Our fracturing operations continue to be almost exclusively focused in the Montney, Duvernay and Deep Basin, and I don't expect there will be a lot of changes there in the next few years. The cement division is continuing to operate with high utilization and is generating great results. Q2 was another good quarter for that division, and it's an indication of our expertise and our leading market position in that service line. I think we generated 4% higher revenue and 10% higher EBITDA in Q2 of this year versus 2023. And that's just really a result of the quarter being more active in the industry as a whole, especially in June.</p><p>We hold about a 50% market share in the Montney, can be as high as 80% in the Deep Basin, and we continue to look at expanding our cement division market share throughout the basin and back into some of the areas that we've previously had to vacate just due to manpower issues. A lot of the manpower problems that we've had with this division in the last few years have really been mitigated here in the last year or two. And we can -- starting to look to expand this division as we're able to add qualified staff. And we continue to invest in technology and equipment and look at new blends for the different parts of the basin. And we continue to expect this division will perform very well in the future.</p><p>On the coiled tubing side, we're making good progress in the coiled tubing division. We've been focused on growing our market share. We continue to operate only seven coil crews. So there's lots of room for growth here. But we did grow our revenue about 18% year over year, but we're still struggling with profitability given the scale of this business. And we need to really grow the number of units that we're operating in order to realize the profitability potential of that division.</p><p>We have good field margins. But overall, the scale is just not high enough to offset some of the fixed costs that are associated with operating coil throughout the basin, providing different coil sizes to our customers in any areas that they may want. But we expect that this will be generating attractive financial returns within the next year.</p><p>We're looking forward to our -- I think we have discussed this in the past. We're looking forward to the start of our strategic partnership with [ACOS], which is a specialized tool company. And that should also help grow our market share in the oilier sections of the basin, particularly where there's multilateral well designs. And this is a reentry tool that we are going to be using to go back into these wells to evaluate and hopefully increase production from some of these shallower oil wells. And this is a market we're not currently active in at all. So it's all additive to this division.</p><p>We're essentially at an inflection point in this -- in the coil division. If we can add a few more units, we can significantly increase our profitability.</p><p>Outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the second half to remain busy, especially given where we are with natural gas prices year to date. The financial discipline that's been displayed by our customers in the last few years is really showing in the reduction of volatility that we've had from quarter to quarter and year to year. And with customers only spending about 50% of cash flow, it gives them a really good buffer to sort of look through these temporary commodity price dips or periods of weakness, and they continue to operate, I would say, on a very level loaded, thoughtful basis. And so we expect this year to be, maybe not quite as strong as last year, just due to gas prices, but we still expect the second half of this year to be busy.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the forest fire activity and the drought conditions, and this really hasn't played out nearly to the extent that we thought it might even a few months ago. The water issues were basically restricted to certain areas of the basin. We do have active forest fires this summer as we have in the past few years, which can push work around -- we may have to abandon certain areas for a short period of time.</p><p>But the work doesn't go away. It just moves to a different month or a different quarter, and we'll just continue to monitor and make sure that our staff is safe, and that we're not getting in the way of forest firefighting activities. But generally, it's just a waiting game. And as the summer comes to an end, we'll get back to normal.</p><p>Fortunately, the strip for natural gas for this winter and throughout 2025 is still at economic levels. So we're not expecting this natural gas price weakness to last forever. And as a result, with the gas prices, as always happens, we do experience some pricing pressure, but it really hasn't been terribly significant, and we expect to continue to generate good operating results going forward.</p><p>Montney will be the focus of our operations. The Duvernay is building momentum. It's very fracturing intensive, and I'll talk a little bit about that again, because our customers are excited from the results of this play, both in the southern and in the Kaybob areas. We've been very active. The well results have been great. We expect this to be a growing source of demand for our services. The Duvernay currently represents a very small percentage of production and activity in Western Canada. I think it's less than 5%. And we think that our fracturing technology, particularly the last Tier 4 fleet that we activated earlier this year, is very well suited for these plays, high pressure, low emissions, small footprint on location.</p><p>On the corporate strategy side, our priorities have not changed. We want to build a resilient, sustainable and differentiated company, invest in high-growth, profitable opportunities to ensure that we continue to generate returns for our shareholders. And we want to provide a consistent return of capital to our shareholders as well through the dividend. And even though it may be slower than expected for the next few quarters, we're still very bullish on the industry in Canada. We view Western Canada as an attractive basin to develop and grow our business.</p><p>As everybody knows, the LNG export potential -- LNG export capacity continues to build momentum. And you've seen that in the rig count, even though we've had weak natural gas prices for the last sort of six to nine months, you really haven't seen a whole lot of change to the rig count. In fact, it's essentially flat year over year. We still believe that Canada is going to play a very important role in providing the world with cleaner, more sustainable energy. The demand is growing from places like the Asia part of the world. We expect that our LNG facilities will continue to grow and will become an important part of the equation for many parts of the world when they're thinking about how to get clean, reliable energy.</p><p>We expect that LNG drilling will stay active. It's been active now for the last sort of year or two. We're expecting the first cargoes of LNG to leave the West Coast late this year, early next year, and that provides a great foundation of activity that this basin has never really have. LNG Phase 1 represents about 11% demand growth for Canadian natural gas, and Phase 2, double that capacity.</p><p>On the oil side, TMX expansion is now operational. I think it will get to maximum capacity in the next sort of 18 months. But it's -- for the first time now, we have more of an outlet for our oil, reducing differentials and expected price volatility of Canadian oil prices.</p><p>So everything is coming together nicely. Our customers are still only spending about 50% of their free cash flow in drilling and completions and their balance sheets are in great shape, and so is ours. We've maintained a clean balance sheet for the last few years as we've executed our strategic plan and we'll take advantage of any investment opportunities that we find that will provide superior returns.</p><p>On the sand logistics side, we've discussed this for the last few years that we think logistics is growing in its importance. And we think it will play an ever-increasing role in operating efficiency and profitability, in particular, in our fracturing operations. We are -- July 25, we made a press release that we had entered into a strategic partnership with Source to develop the sand transloading facility in Northeast BC, which will service the Montney play, which is the source gas for LNG. And this partnership will benefit Trican from both a strategic and a cost perspective.</p><p>Most of the sand we currently use in Northeast BC and the Montney is moved by truck from terminals in Grand Prairie, resulting in a 8- to 12-hour round trip trucking time for each of these sand loads. This new facility will allow the sand to be picked up or will allow it to be railed to Northeast BC to a town called Taylor, will allow us to pick up the sand significantly closer to our customer sites, cutting our trucking time by as much as 50%.</p><p>And that because of trucking times are reduced, it allows us to use more of our internal trucking resources and less third-party resources, allowing us to keep that margin that we earn on our trucking division. And Kurt Lucas and Jim Rukin have done a great job building our internal trucking division and we continue to expect more good things coming from that. We've grown that division now from about 60 to about 80 trucks in the -- year to date, which has been a big help to improving profitability in our logistics system.</p><p>This is really important when you think about what's happening from a frac intensity perspective because the strategic value of being able to have sand in Northeast BC, when you've seen sand volumes grow as much as they have in the past few years on a per well on a per stage basis. Even two years ago, the basin was only utilizing about 6 million tons of sand, and now we're well over 8 million tons this year. With some of these wells that we've discussed previously, you're using 50 to 100 rail cars of sand. So anytime you can take six hours of logistics time out of the equation, you're drastically increasing reliability, especially in the winter months. And it's a big advantage to our customers to have that transload facility in Northeast BC.</p><p>On the equipment side, we continue to differentiate ourselves, further refining our low emission fleet and working towards our 100% natural gas-fueled operations goal. We're the only company in Canada right now that's using electric equipment. It's been very well received. We've added our electric storage system, which is basically a battery system for redundancy on location. It's working flawlessly and provides a great and lowers total energy consumption on location.</p><p>We're very happy with the performance of the equipment from an R&amp;M perspective. The two sets of electric equipment we have today of -- have now had a few hundred thousand tons of sand put through them with great reliability. The R&amp;M is down considerably when we compare it to conventional equipment, and we expect to activate our third set of electric equipment this fall.</p><p>When you combine the electric ancillary equipment with the Tier 4 pumps, we're now getting substitution rates as high as 85% on location with natural gas versus diesel. And the price differential between natural gas on an energy equivalent basis compared to diesel is significant.</p><p>Natural gas is very abundant in Canada. It burns cleaner and on an energy equivalent basis is about a tenth of the price. So we expect that the industry will trend towards 100% natural gas-fueled operations, and we view ourselves as a leader from an equipment perspective in Western Canada.</p><p>I'll finish up with just some comments on the investments and return of capital. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and we maintain our clean balance sheet. And we do subscribe to a diversified return on capital strategy through a combination of the base level dividend and the NCIB that we've been active in with over the last few years.</p><p>But as an oilfield services company, we do experience some swings in our working capital and cash balance. And as a result, we've had some comments that our cash balances have been high at times and it's not an efficient way to operate our company. But between CapEx, dividends, the transload investment, the NCIB, we expect to spend more than 100% of our free cash flow this year. In fact, we expect to outspend our operating cash flow by about $80 million.</p><p>However, we did start the year with a balance of $88 million of cash, so we should finish 2024 fiscal year essentially cash neutral. So we do ask for some patience. You do see some swings in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and year to year, but it all makes sense in the long term. We're not afraid to temporarily dip into our bank lines when we find attractive investment opportunities.</p><p>But we will continue to be active in our NCIB program at the right price. I think in the second quarter of this year, we purchased 6.2 million shares. And then since the quarter end, we've purchased an additional 2.4 million shares.</p><p>We hope to complete our program by early October this year. And then when you look at the last 12-month spend on the NCIB, it's close to $100 million. So we'll continue to spend capital on our NCIB, but we will evaluate that in the context of our other investment opportunities. We're always looking for the best possible returns for our shareholders, and we'll allocate capital accordingly. And today, that has included buying our own shares. But we are seeing more organic growth opportunities that we may be pursuing in the future.</p><p>And I'll just close off with our dividend. And I think Scott had mentioned, we did have a dividend price or dividend increase early this year. And we expect that at the end of this year, we will review the results from our NCIB, and we may make adjustments to our quarterly dividend with the target of being we want to spend approximately $35 million a year in aggregate dividends, and we'll just sort of adjust our per share numbers accordingly to make sure we maintain those levels.</p><p>So I think I'll stop there, and we'll go to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Aaron MacNeil, TD Cowen.</p><p>AARON MACNEIL, ANALYST, TD SECURITIES: Brad, you mentioned the second half of the year will be down year over year. I guess I'm just wondering how do you think the trend of activity will play out? And I guess I'm wondering, is Q3 going to be weaker and then you see a sort of a pickup in Q4 into the winter drilling season? Or do you see sort of a more typical seasonal pattern where budgets get exhausted and things slow down toward into the holidays?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: No, I do think it will be more typical. I mean, with some adjustments, I guess, to account for things, you've had some projects get pushed around for water availability or temporary restrictions due to fires, et cetera. And so you may see work get sort of pushed from Q3 into Q4. We are hearing some rumblings that some work from Q1 of 2025 could be pulled back into Q4. So I think it will be the typical seasonal pattern with some minor tweaks just due to water, fires, and individual companies moving capital around.</p><p>But I don't think that will have a significant impact on it. I think going forward, I think we're going to continue to see strong Q2s, and then a drift off in December, which is great for our industry, right, and the people that work here. It's a welcome change to the activity timing.</p><p>AARON MACNEIL: Okay. Makes sense. I guess more importantly, what's sort of the 2025 upside scenario from your perspective? And then more specifically, like do you think you need an eight frac fleet or a sixth frac fleet conversion with LNG Canada on the doorstep?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Yeah. I think both of those assumptions are very reasonable.</p><p>AARON MACNEIL: Potential timeline for that would look like --</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Well, the lead time on equipment is still fairly significant. The equipment that we have parked to the side is fully operational. It's not sort of theoretical spreads that require a significant capital investment and a bunch of maintenance work. We can take equipment off the fence and put it into the field as quickly as we can staff it. There won't be any delays there.</p><p>If you want to convert equipment to Tier 4 or any other technology, you do have to start thinking about that six months or so in advance. And we're always looking at that every day. And certainly, I think your instincts are correct. It doesn't take much increase in activity in Canada for us to require more equipment in the field. And we fully expect that if fracturing gear gets added to the Western Basin here that we will be the beneficiary of that, and we are the natural provider of additional equipment.</p><p>But as you know, we're very disciplined. We will not put out equipment unless we get a return on every single hour that it's operating.</p><p>AARON MACNEIL: You sort of insinuated that labor friction had been reduced? Did I interpret that correctly?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Yeah. I think in the industry as a whole, the labor constraints have definitely been reduced. And I think that's a result of the fact that the industry has been operating at a fairly level loaded -- or has been fairly level loaded from year to year and quarter to quarter. And that is a huge appeal to people wanting to come into the industry. On the oilfield services side, the biggest hurdle that we face is the earnings volatility that we would have from quarter to quarter and year to year.</p><p>And so I think people are sort of watching their neighbor get up and go to work every day in all four quarters. And there's been no talk of layoffs anywhere in the industry, other maybe than the odd spot here and there. And that's a big change. It wasn't that long ago that there would be layoffs every spring, a lot of changes from quarter to quarter and year to year. So this is more in line with what people want from a financial planning perspective, and it's helped tremendously, I think.</p><p>Our turnover is very, very low. We've never seen turnover levels this low before. In the frac division, our turnover is less than 5%. Historically, you would expect it to be at about 20%. I'm talking about voluntary turnover from the staff. So I think it's a good indication that earnings stability and predictability is very helpful in attracting people to the industry.</p><p>OPERATOR: Josef Schachter, Schachter Energy Research.</p><p>JOSEF SCHACHTER, ANALYST, SCHACHTER ENERGY RESEARCH SERVICES INC.: Good morning, Brad and Scott and the team. I have two questions. Given how tight and the fact that you have the remaining equipment on the side for fracking. Is there any concern about the operators in the states given how weak things are, bringing up equipment into Canada?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Yeah. It's always a concern and has been for as long as I've been in the industry, which is 25 years or so. And you do see equipment come and go. There's no doubt about it. I would say the one thing that is working for us is -- the two big players in Canada are Halliburton and Liberty.</p><p>And from what we understand, and I certainly cannot speak for them, but is their US operations are more profitable than their Canadian operations. And so that -- I mean, that's always helpful. But I do think the LNG opportunity in Canada for the drillers and the frackers is so significant that I think everybody is looking at it. And we expect to compete based on quality of service and quality of our technology, and we're happy to do so, and we're happy to compete in case anybody that wants to come to Canada.</p><p>JOSEF SCHACHTER: Super. And my second question is can you give us a little more light on the Source Energy deal with the rail and the new facility? Are you guys each going to keep your own customers and the benefit to you, as you said, is rail versus trucking? And what happens if there's new customers, do you guys compete against each other? Is there any understanding there? Just to get an idea of what might happen in the future.</p><p>SCOTT MATSON: Sure. I mean, I won't get into the details of the commercial specifics of it. But suffice it to say, I mean, industry in general is going to benefit from this investment, and we would rather be on the inside working through the process than on the outside looking in. One of the positives about working with a partner like Source is that they're an integrated supplier. So they have the sand supply as well as the transload facility and expertise.</p><p>So I mean, you would think about it that they're bringing that expertise and the operational logistical capabilities to the table to get the sand in the BC closer. And we're partnering in there. We're going to benefit from picking up sand in a closer proximity and being able to use more of our own trucks. And together, this will benefit the industry overall.</p><p>JOSEF SCHACHTER: Do you guys use Source for sand at this time?</p><p>SCOTT MATSON: We do. We would be a fairly significant customer for most of the sand suppliers throughout Western Canada for sure. And maybe just kind of a final point on that. One of the big benefits from a Trican perspective is that if you're a large customer in Northeastern BC and you want security of supply of your sand coming in, you can -- we can provide that, right, through this facility. So we would have significant guaranteed supply on the ground from that facility where our other competitors would not be able to offer that.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) John Gibson, BMO Capital Markets.</p><p>JOHN GIBSON, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: I was wondering if you could expand on pricing discussions. I mean, we've been in the balance here for a few quarters, it seems. And Q1 '25 looks to be fairly active. Are you starting to have more positive discussions around pricing? Or is it still pretty subdued?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: We are maybe a little different than most in that we've had our customer list, our core customer list, our top 10, 15 customers for years. And so we tend to take a more long-term view of pricing, and our discussions with our customers are tweaks. And I think everybody sort of understands the direction of the industry and that things are likely to be tweaked up, not down next year.</p><p>But generally, our pricing discussions are always fairly subdued just due to the long-term relationships of our customer base. So we're maybe not sort of the best person or the best company to ask as to sort of spot pricing, where some of our competitors are maybe more jostling from quarter to quarter with an ever-changing customer list.</p><p>JOHN GIBSON: Okay. That's fair. And also for me, I mean, you mentioned the $35 million in aggregate dividends. Your valuation is starting to move up there, and you talked about the NCIB being somewhat price dependent. Wondering if you could alter this level given where your shares are at as well as the free cash flow generating capabilities of the business, or is that number going to be pretty static going forward?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: I missed -- sorry, John, I missed the second part.</p><p>JOHN GIBSON: Just wondering if that $35 million in aggregate dividends you target will be static? Or just depending if your shares stay at these levels, your valuation stays kind of here, you can slow the NCIB a bit?</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Well, I'm a shareholder. I would hope the industry would support higher aggregate dividend, annual payments like every other shareholder. And so we look at everything in the context of sort of the next five years and how we view it. So right now, I would say that's fairly -- that level is fairly static. But hey, if there's, what, 6 million, 7 million -- or 6, 7 Bcf a day of potential LNG facilities, that could change everything with -- we get more positive FIDs.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Fedora for any closing remarks.</p><p>BRADLEY FEDORA: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining. We appreciate your interest in our company. We will be available for the rest of the day for any questions that you may have. Please just call us directly, and we'd be happy to help you.

Welcome to the Trican Well Service Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions].</p><p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Brad Fedora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Trican Well Service Ltd. Please go ahead, Mr. Fedora.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much for joining us, and good morning, everyone. First, Scott Matson, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the quarterly results, and then I will provide some comments with respect to the quarter, current operating conditions and our outlook for the future. We'll then open up the call for questions. We have several members of our executive team here in the room and are available to answer any questions that anybody may have.</p><p>I'll now turn the call back to Scott.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brad. So just before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements and other information based on current expectations or results for the company. Certain material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing conclusions or making projections are reflected in the forward-looking information section of our MD&amp;A for Q2 2024.</p><p>A number of business risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements and our financial outlook. Please refer to our 2023 annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a more complete description of business risks and uncertainties facing Trican. This document is available on our website and on SEDAR.</p><p>During this call, we will refer to several common industry terms and use certain non-GAAP measures, which are more fully described in our Q2 2024 MD&amp;A. Our quarterly results were released after the close of market last night and are available both on SEDAR and our website.</p><p>So with that, I'll do a brief summary of our results for the quarter. My comments will draw comparisons mostly to the second quarter of last year, but I'll also provide a bit of commentary about our quarterly activity and our expectations going forward.</p><p>Trican's results for the quarter compared to last year's Q2 were generally stronger due to a busier and less severe spring break-up. We saw an increase in operating activity compared to the last year as some of our customers completed their programs that they had previously deferred from Q1 of 2024, and other customers accelerated some of their programs that were scheduled for the second half of 2024, in order to mitigate some of the potential water summer constraints, summer water constraints and access concerns regarding seasonal forest fires that they've experienced in prior years.</p><p>Revenues for the quarter were CAD211.8 million with adjusted EBITDA of CAD40.7 million or 19% of revenues, both up approximately 20% from last year. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter came in at CAD45.2 million, or 21% of revenues. To arrive at EBITDAS we add back the effects of cash settled share-based compensation recognized in the quarter to more clearly show the results of our operations and remove some of the financial noise associated with the changes in our share price as we mark-to-market these items.</p><p>On a consolidated basis, we continue to generate positive earnings, generating CAD16.2 million in the quarter, which translates to CAD0.08 per share, both on a basic and fully diluted basis. Trican generated free cash flow of CAD20.9 million during the quarter. Our definition of free cash flow is essentially EBITDAS less non-discretionary cash expenditures, which include maintenance capital, interest, current tax and cash settled stock-based comp. You can see more details on this in the non-GAAP measures section of our MD&amp;A.</p><p>Capex for the quarter totaled CAD25.9 million, split between maintenance capital of about CAD14 million and upgrade capital of CAD11.9 million. Our upgrade capital was dedicated mainly to the electrification of ancillary frac equipment and ongoing investments to maintain the productive capability of Trican's active equipment.</p><p>Balance sheet remains in great shape. We exited the quarter with positive working capital of approximately CAD148.4 million, including cash of CAD36 million. And as anticipated, our cash position decreased compared to year-end with some of the major factors as follows: working capital decreased by CAD4.8 million, as working capital unwound combined with the effects of spring breakup on operating activity; tax payments were a combined CAD49.6 million, and I would note that CAD36.4 million of that related to our 2023 tax bill that was outstanding, which we telegraphed throughout 2023; the remainder related to our ongoing installment program for 2024.</p><p>NCIB funding was CAD43.8 million during the year, CAD27.2 million of that during the quarter. And our dividend payment was CAD18.3 million in the year, CAD9 million for this quarter. With respect to our return of capital strategy, we repurchased and canceled 6.2 million shares under our NCIB program in the quarter. And subsequent to Q2 of 2024, we purchased back and canceled an additional 2.4 million shares and continue to be active with our buyback program as we move towards its renewal in October.</p><p>As noted in our press release, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of CAD0.045 per share, reflecting approximately CAD8.6 million in aggregate payment to shareholders. Distribution is scheduled to be made on September 30th of 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2024. And I would note that those dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income taxes, income tax purposes.</p><p>So with that, I'll turn things back to Brad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks. My comments will include the quarter and then current and forward-looking observations will be quite similar to our last conference call as not a whole lot has changed since May. Overall, Q2 was better than expected. We continue to be pleasantly surprised that our customers continue to level load their programs throughout the year. I actually expect our past experiences with Q2 breakup is a thing of the past. And I think it's reasonable to expect that in the future, the second quarter will generate positive earnings in our industry, which is a refreshing change. And then we'll, in exchange, we'll see more of a slowdown at the end of Q4 in and around Christmas.</p><p>As always, there was lots of weather and spring thaw delays throughout the quarter, but nothing, nothing that wasn't typical. And overall, like I said, the quarter went very well. Certain of our customers moved Q3 work forward into Q2 to avoid potential water restriction issues that are just the result of ongoing drought conditions in Western Canada. And so that was a significant help to our quarter, but this will come at a cost to our Q3 results. So, the work does move around from quarter-to-quarter. That's nothing to be concerned about.</p><p>Frac revenue was up 30% year-over-year, and EBITDA in that division was up over 50%. So a very successful quarter in our frac division. In general, I would say, cost inflation has basically stopped or is very muted. In fact, there are pockets of, there are areas where we're starting to see some of our costs actually decrease. So that's a welcome change to the past few years, and that helps with, offset a lot of the pricing pressure that we've been experiencing over the last six months.</p><p>We are still operating seven frac crews. We commissioned our fifth Tier 4 fleet earlier in the year, which is, which was designed to operate in the Duvernay and the high-pressure areas of the Montney. We still, I think we still are taking a very disciplined approach to the basin, and we are operating about 60% of our total horsepower compared to our competitors that are running full blast. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the industry, and we will bring back equipment as, as required and at a time when we think we can generate return on all of the hours that it's operating.</p><p>Our fracturing operations continue to be almost exclusively focused in the Montney, Duvernay and Deep Basin, and I don't expect there'll be a lot of changes there in the next few years. The cement division is continuing to operate with high utilization and is generating great results. Q2 was another good quarter for that division, and it's an indication of our expertise and our leading market position in that service line. I think we generated 4% higher revenue and 10% higher EBITDA in Q2 of this year versus 2023. And that's just really a result of, of the quarter being more active in the industry as a whole, especially in June.</p><p>We hold about a 50% market share in the Montney, can be as high as 80% in the Deep Basin, and we continue to, we continue to look at expanding our cement division market share throughout the basin and back into some of the areas that we've previously had to vacate just due to manpower issues. A lot of the manpower problems that we've had with this division in the last few years have really been mitigated here in the last year or two, and we can start, starting to look to expand this division as we're able to add qualified staff. And we continue to invest in technology and equipment and look at new blends for the different parts of the basin, and we continue to expect this division will perform very well in the future.</p><p>On the coiled tubing side, we're making good progress in the coiled tubing division. We've been focused on growing our market share. We continue to operate only seven coil crews. So there's lots of room for growth here. But we did grow our revenue about 18% year-over-year, but we're still struggling with profitability given the scale of this business. And we need to really grow the number of units that we're operating in order to realize the profitability potential of that division.</p><p>We have good field margins. But overall, the scale is just not high enough to offset some of the fixed costs that are associated with operating coil throughout the basin, providing different coil sizes to our customers in any areas that they may want. But we expect that this will be generating attractive financial returns within the next year.</p><p>Now, we're looking forward to our, I think we have discussed this in the past, we're looking forward to the start of our strategic partnership with ACOS [Phonetic], which is a specialized tool company, and that should also help grow our market share in the oilier sections of the basin, particularly where there's multilateral well designs. And this is a re-entry tool that we are going to be using to go back into these wells to evaluate and hopefully increase production from some of these shallower oil, oil wells. And this is a market we're not currently active in at all. So, it's all additive to this division. We're essentially at an inflection point in this, in the coil division. If we can add a few more units, we can significantly increase our profitability.</p><p>Outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the second half to remain busy, especially given where we are with natural gas prices year-to-date. The financial discipline that's been displayed by our customers in the last few years is really showing in the reduction of volatility that we've had from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And with customers only spending about 50% of cash flow, it gives them a really good buffer to sort of look through these temporary commodity price dips or weak, periods of weakness, and they continue to operate, I would say, on a very level loaded thoughtful basis. And so we expect this year to be, maybe not quite as strong as last year, just due to gas prices, but we still expect the second half of this year to be busy.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the forest fire activity and the drought conditions, and this really hasn't played out nearly to the extent that we thought it might even a few months ago. The water issues were basically restricted to certain areas of the basin. We do have active forest fires this summer as we have in the past few years, which can push work around, we may have to abandon certain areas for a short period of time. But the work doesn't go away. It just moves to a different month or a different quarter, and we'll just continue to monitor and make sure that our staff is safe, and we're not getting in the way of forest firefighting activities. But generally, it's just a, it's just a waiting game and as the summer comes to an end, we'll get back to normal.</p><p>Fortunately, the strip for natural gas for this winter and throughout 2025 is still at economic levels. So we're not expecting, we're not expecting this natural gas price weakness to last forever. And as a result, with the gas prices, as always happens, we do experience some pricing pressure, but it really hasn't been terribly significant, and we expect to continue to generate good operating results going forward. Montney will be the focus of our operations.</p><p>The Duvernay is building momentum. It's very fracturing intensive, and I'll talk a little bit about that again, because our customers are excited from the results of this play, both in the southern and in the Kaybob areas. We've been very active. The well results have been great. We expect this to be a growing source of demand for our services. The Duvernay currently represents a very small percentage of production and activity in Western Canada, I think it's less than 5%. And we think that our fracturing technology, particularly the last Tier 4 fleet that we activated earlier this year, is very well suited for these plays, high pressure, low emissions, small, small footprint on location.</p><p>On the corporate strategy side, our priorities have not changed. We want to build a resilient, sustainable and differentiated company, invest in high-growth, profitable opportunities to ensure that we continue to generate returns for our shareholders, and we want to provide a consistent return of capital to our shareholders as well through the dividend. And even though it may be slower than expected for the next few quarters, we're still very bullish on the industry in Canada. We view Western Canada as an attractive basin to develop and grow our business.</p><p>As everybody knows, the LNG export potential, LNG export capacity continues to build momentum. And you've seen that in the rig count, even though we've had weak natural gas prices for the last sort of six months to nine months, you really haven't seen a whole lot of change to the rig count. In fact, it's essentially flat year-over-year. We still believe that Canada is going to play a very important role in providing the world with cleaner, more sustainable energy. The demand is growing from places like the Asia, the Asia part of the world. We expect that our LNG facilities will continue to grow and will become an important part of the equation for many parts of the world when they're thinking about how to get clean, reliable energy.</p><p>We expect that LNG drilling will stay active. It's been active now for the last sort of year or two. We're expecting the first cargoes of LNG to leave the West Coast late this year, early next year, and that provides a great foundation of activity that this basin has never really have. LNG Phase 1 represents about 11% demand growth for Canadian natural gas and Phase 2 double that capacity.</p><p>On the oil side, TMX expansion is now operational. I think it will get to maximum capacity in the next sort of 18 months. But it's, for the first time now, we have more of an outlet for our oil, reducing differentials and expected price volatility of Canadian oil prices. So, everything is coming together nicely. Our customers are still only spending about 50% of their free cash flow in drilling and completions and their balance sheets are in great shape, and so as ours. We've maintained a clean balance sheet for the last few years as we've executed our strategic plan and we'll take advantage of any investment opportunities that we find that will provide superior returns.</p><p>On the sand logistics side, we've discussed this for the last few years that we think logistics is growing in its importance. And we think it will play an ever-increasing role in operating efficiency and profitability, in particular in our fracturing operations. We are, the July 25, we made a press release that we had entered into a strategic partnership with Source to develop the sand transloading facility in Northeast BC, which will service the Montney play, which is the source gas for LNG. And this, this partnership will benefit Trican from both a strategic and a cost perspective.</p><p>Most of the sand we currently use in Northeast BC and the Montney is moved by truck from terminals in Grand Prairie, resulting in a eight-hour to 12-hour round trip trucking time for each of these sand loads. This new facility will allow the sand to be picked up or will allow it to be railed to Northeast BC to a town called Taylor, will allow us to pick up the sand significantly closer to our customer sites, cutting our trucking time by as much as 50%. And that because of trucking times are reduced, it allows us to use more of our internal trucking resources and less third-party resources allowing us to keep that margin that we, we earn on, on our, in our trucking division.</p><p>And Kurt Lucas and Jim, Jim Rukin have done a great job building our internal trucking division, and we continue to expect more good things coming from that. We've grown that division now from about 60 trucks to about 80 trucks in the, year-to-date, which has been a big help to improving profitability in our logistics system.</p><p>This is really important when you think about what's happening from a, from a frac intensity perspective, because the strategic value of being able to have sand in Northeast BC, when you've seen sand volumes grow as much as they have in the past few years on a per well on a per-stage basis. Even two years ago, the basin was only utilizing about 6 million tons of sand and now we're well over 8 million tons this year. Some of these wells that we've discussed previously, you're using 50 to 100 rail cars of sand. So anytime you can take six hours of logistics time out of the equation, you're drastically increasing reliability, especially in the winter months. And it's a big advantage to our customers to have, to have that transload facility in Northeast BC.</p><p>On the equipment side, we continue to differentiate ourselves, further refining our low emission fleet and working towards our 100% natural gas-fueled operations goal. We're the only company in Canada right now that's using electric equipment. It's been very well received. We've added our electric storage system, which is basically a battery system for redundancy on location. It's working flawlessly and provides a great and lowers total energy consumption on location. We're very happy with the performance of the equipment from an R&amp;M perspective.</p><p>The two sets of electric equipment we have today of have now had a few hundred thousand tons of sand put through them with great reliability. The R&amp;M is down considerably when we compare it to conventional equipment, and we expect to activate our third set of electric equipment this fall. When you combine the electric ancillary equipment with the Tier 4 pumps, we're now getting substitution rates as high as 85% on location with natural gas versus diesel.</p><p>And the price differential between natural gas on an energy equivalent basis compared to diesel is significant. Natural gas is very abundant in Canada. It burns cleaner and on an energy equivalent basis is about 1/10 [Phonetic] of the price. So we expect that the industry will trend towards 100% natural gas-fueled operations, and we view ourselves as a leader from an equipment perspective in Western Canada.</p><p>I'll finish up with just some comments on, on investments and return of capital. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and we maintain our clean balance sheet. And we do subscribe to a diversified return on capital strategy through a combination of the base level dividend and the NCIB that we've been active in with over the last few years. But as an oilfield services company, we do experience some swings in our working capital and cash balance.</p><p>And as a result, we've had some comments that our cash balances have been high at times, and it's not an efficient way to operate our company. But between capex, dividends, the transload investment, the NCIB, we expect to spend more than 100% of our free cash flow this year. In fact, we expect to outspend our operating cash flow by about CAD80 million. However, we did start the year with a balance of CAD88 million of cash, so we should finish 2024 fiscal year essentially cash neutral.</p><p>So we do ask for some patience, you do see some, some swings in our cash balance from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but it all makes sense in the long term. We're not afraid to temporarily dip into our bank lines when we find attractive investment opportunities. We will continue to be active in our NCIB program at the right price. I think in the second quarter of this year, we purchased 6.2 million shares, and then since the quarter end, we've purchased an additional 2.4 million shares. We hope to complete our program by early October this year. When you look at the last 12-month spend on the NCIB, it's close to CAD100 million.</p><p>So, we'll continue to spend, we'll continue to spend capital on the NCIB, but we will evaluate that in the context of our other investment opportunities. We're always looking for the best possible returns for our shareholders, and we'll allocate capital accordingly. And today, that has included buying, buying our own shares. But we are seeing more organic growth opportunities that we may be pursuing in the future.</p><p>And I'll just close off with our dividend. And I think Scott had mentioned, we did have a dividend price or dividend increase early this year, and we expect that at the end of this year, we will review the results from our NCIB, and we, we may make adjustments to our quarterly dividend with the target of being we want to spend approximately CAD35 million a year in aggregate dividends, and we'll just sort of adjust our per share numbers accordingly to make sure we maintain those levels.</p><p>So, I think I'll stop there, and we'll go to questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, you mentioned the second half of the year will be down year-over-year. I guess, I'm just wondering how do you think the trend of activity will play out? And I guess I'm wondering is Q3 going to be weaker and then you see a sort of a pickup in Q4 into the winter drilling season? Or do you see sort of a more typical seasonal pattern where budgets get exhausted and things slow down towards into the holidays?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>No, I do think it will be more typical. I mean with some adjustments, I guess to account for things, you've had some projects get pushed around for water availability or temporary restrictions due to fires, et cetera. And so you may see work get sort of pushed from Q3 into Q4. We are hearing some rumblings that some work from Q1 of 2025 could be pulled back into Q4. So, I think it will be the typical seasonal pattern with some minor tweaks just due to water, fires and individual companies moving, moving capital around. But I don't think that will have a significant impact on it. I think going forward, I think we're going to continue to see strong Q2s, and then a drift off in December, which is great for our industry, right, and the people that work here. It's a welcome change to the activity timing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Makes sense. I guess more importantly, what's sort of the 2025 upside scenario from your perspective? And then more specifically, like do you think you need an eighth frac fleet or a sixth frac fleet conversion with LNGCanada on the doorstep?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think both of those assumptions are very reasonable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Potential timeline for that would look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the lead time on equipment is still fairly significant. The equipment that we have parked to the side is fully operational. It's not sort of theoretical spreads that require a significant capital investment and a bunch of maintenance work. We can, we can take equipment off the fence and put it into the field as quickly as we can staff it. There won't be any delays there. If you want to convert equipment to Tier 4 or any other technology, you do have to start thinking about that six months or so in advance.</p><p>And we're always looking at that every day. And certainly, I think your instincts are correct. It doesn't take much increase in activity in Canada for us to require more equipment in the field. And we fully expect that if fracturing gear gets added to the Western Basin here that we will be the beneficiary of that, and we are the natural provider of additional equipment. But as you know, we're very disciplined. We will not put out equipment unless we get a return on every single hour that it's operating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>You sort of insinuated that labor friction had been reduced? Did I interpret that correctly?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think in the industry as a whole, the labor constraints have definitely been reduced. And I think that's a result of the fact that the industry has been operating at a fairly level loaded, or has been fairly level loaded from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. And that is a huge appeal to people wanting to come into the industry. On the oilfield services side, the biggest hurdle that we face is the earnings volatility that we would have from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And so I think people are sort of watching their neighbor get up and go to work every day in all four quarters, and there's been no talk of layoffs anywhere in the industry, other maybe than the odd spot here and there.</p><p>And that's a big change. It wasn't that long ago that there would be layoffs every spring, a lot of changes from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So this is more, this is more in line with what people want from a financial planning perspective, and it's helped tremendously, I think. Our turnover is very, very low. Never, we've never seen turnover levels this low before. In the frac division, our turnover is less than 5%. Historically, you would expect it to be at about 20%. I'm talking about voluntary turnover from the staff. So, I think it's a good indication that earnings stability and predictability is very helpful in attracting people to the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Makes sense. Thanks, Brad. I'll turn it back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>The next question comes from Josef Schachter from Schachter Energy Research. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Bard, Scott and the team. I have two questions. Given how tight and the fact that you have the remaining equipment on the side for fracking. Is there any concern about the operators in the states given how weak things are, bringing up equipment into Canada?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. It's always a concern and has been for as long as I've been in the industry, which is 25 years or so. And you do see equipment come and go. There's no doubt about it. I would say, the one thing that is working for us is, the two big players in Canada are Halliburton and Liberty. And from what we understand, and I certainly cannot speak for them, but is their US operations are more profitable than their Canadian operations. And so that, I mean, that's always helpful.</p><p>But I do think the LNG opportunity in Canada for, for the drillers and the frackers is so significant that I think everybody is looking at it. And we expect to compete based on quality of service and quality of our technology, and we're happy to do so, and we're happy to compete in case anybody that wants to come to Canada.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Super. And my second question is, can you give us a little more light on the Source Energy deal with the rail and the new facility. Are you guys each going to keep your own customers and the benefit to you, as you said is rail versus trucking? And what happens if there's new customers, do you guys compete against each other? Is there any understanding there? Just to get an idea of what might happen in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I mean, I won't get into the details of the commercial specifics of it. But suffice it to say, I mean, industry in general is going to benefit from this, this investment. And we would rather be on the inside working through the process than on the outside looking in. One of the positives about working with a partner like Source is that they're an integrated supplier. So they have the sand supply as well as the transload facility and expertise.</p><p>So I mean, you would think about it, that they're bringing that expertise and the operational logistical capabilities to the table to get the sand in the BC closer, and we're partnering in there. We're going to benefit from picking up sand in a closer proximity and being able to use more of our own trucks. And together, this will benefit the industry overall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Do you, do you guys use Source for sand at this time?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>We do. We would be a fairly significant customer for most of the sand suppliers throughout Western Canada for sure. And maybe just kind of a final point on that. One of the big benefits from a Trican perspective is that, if you're a large customer in Northeastern BC and you want security of supply of your sands coming in, you can, we can provide that, right, through this facility. So we would have significant guaranteed supply on the ground from that, from that facility where our other competitors would not be able to offer that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Super. Thanks for the color on that. I much appreciate your thought. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>You bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from John Gibson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, all. I was wondering if you could expand on pricing discussions. I mean, we've been in the balance here for a few quarters, it seems. And Q1 '25 looks to be fairly active. Are you starting to have more positive discussions around pricing? Or is it still pretty subdued?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>We are maybe a little different than most in that. We've had our customer list, our core customer list, our top 10 customers, 15 customers for years. And so we tend to take a more long-term view of pricing in our discussions with our customers are tweaks. And I think everybody sort of understands the direction of the industry and that things are likely to be tweaked up, not down next year. But generally, our pricing discussions are always fairly subdued just due to the long-term relationships of our customer base. So we're maybe not sort of the best person or the best company to ask as to sort of spot pricing, where some of our competitors are maybe more jostling from quarter-to-quarter with an ever-changing customer list.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's fair. And also for me, I mean, you mentioned the CAD35 million in aggregate dividends. Your valuation is starting to move up there, and you talked about the NCIB being somewhat price dependent. Wondering if you could alter this level given where your shares are at as well as the free cash flow generating capabilities of the business, or is that number going to be pretty static going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>I missed, sorry, John, I missed the second part.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Just wondering if that CAD35 million in aggregate dividends you target will be static? Or just depending if your shares stay at these levels, your valuation stays kind of here, you can slow the NCIB a bit?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I'm a shareholder. I would hope the industry would support higher aggregate dividend, annual payments like every other shareholder. And so we look at everything in the context of sort of the next five years and how we view it. So right now, I would say, that's fairly, that level is fairly static. But hey, if there's, what, 6 million, 7 million, or 6, 7 Bcf a day of potential LNG facilities, that could change everything with, we get more, more positive FIDs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And agreed on all fronts. I'll turn it back. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Fedora for any closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, everyone for joining. We appreciate your interest in our company. We will be available for the rest of the day for any questions that you may have. Please just call us directly, and we'd be happy to help you. Thanks again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-674aaa3df6d6546397e211aa73afca81</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GMP-6DB3-RYW5-803R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 AlphaStreet Inc.

Welcome to the Trican Well Service Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions].</p><p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Brad Fedora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Trican Well Service Ltd. Please go ahead, Mr. Fedora.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you very much for joining us, and good morning, everyone. First, Scott Matson, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the quarterly results, and then I will provide some comments with respect to the quarter, current operating conditions and our outlook for the future. We'll then open up the call for questions. We have several members of our executive team here in the room and are available to answer any questions that anybody may have.</p><p>I'll now turn the call back to Scott.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Brad. So just before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements and other information based on current expectations or results for the company. Certain material factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing conclusions or making projections are reflected in the forward-looking information section of our MD&amp;A for Q2 2024.</p><p>A number of business risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements and our financial outlook. Please refer to our 2023 annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a more complete description of business risks and uncertainties facing Trican. This document is available on our website and on SEDAR.</p><p>During this call, we will refer to several common industry terms and use certain non-GAAP measures, which are more fully described in our Q2 2024 MD&amp;A. Our quarterly results were released after the close of market last night and are available both on SEDAR and our website.</p><p>So with that, I'll do a brief summary of our results for the quarter. My comments will draw comparisons mostly to the second quarter of last year, but I'll also provide a bit of commentary about our quarterly activity and our expectations going forward.</p><p>Trican's results for the quarter compared to last year's Q2 were generally stronger due to a busier and less severe spring break-up. We saw an increase in operating activity compared to the last year as some of our customers completed their programs that they had previously deferred from Q1 of 2024, and other customers accelerated some of their programs that were scheduled for the second half of 2024, in order to mitigate some of the potential water summer constraints, summer water constraints and access concerns regarding seasonal forest fires that they've experienced in prior years.</p><p>Revenues for the quarter were CAD211.8 million with adjusted EBITDA of CAD40.7 million or 19% of revenues, both up approximately 20% from last year. Adjusted EBITDAS for the quarter came in at CAD45.2 million, or 21% of revenues. To arrive at EBITDAS we add back the effects of cash settled share-based compensation recognized in the quarter to more clearly show the results of our operations and remove some of the financial noise associated with the changes in our share price as we mark-to-market these items.</p><p>On a consolidated basis, we continue to generate positive earnings, generating CAD16.2 million in the quarter, which translates to CAD0.08 per share, both on a basic and fully diluted basis. Trican generated free cash flow of CAD20.9 million during the quarter. Our definition of free cash flow is essentially EBITDAS less non-discretionary cash expenditures, which include maintenance capital, interest, current tax and cash settled stock-based comp. You can see more details on this in the non-GAAP measures section of our MD&amp;A.</p><p>Capex for the quarter totaled CAD25.9 million, split between maintenance capital of about CAD14 million and upgrade capital of CAD11.9 million. Our upgrade capital was dedicated mainly to the electrification of ancillary frac equipment and ongoing investments to maintain the productive capability of Trican's active equipment.</p><p>Balance sheet remains in great shape. We exited the quarter with positive working capital of approximately CAD148.4 million, including cash of CAD36 million. And as anticipated, our cash position decreased compared to year-end with some of the major factors as follows: working capital decreased by CAD4.8 million, as working capital unwound combined with the effects of spring breakup on operating activity; tax payments were a combined CAD49.6 million, and I would note that CAD36.4 million of that related to our 2023 tax bill that was outstanding, which we telegraphed throughout 2023; the remainder related to our ongoing installment program for 2024.</p><p>NCIB funding was CAD43.8 million during the year, CAD27.2 million of that during the quarter. And our dividend payment was CAD18.3 million in the year, CAD9 million for this quarter. With respect to our return of capital strategy, we repurchased and canceled 6.2 million shares under our NCIB program in the quarter. And subsequent to Q2 of 2024, we purchased back and canceled an additional 2.4 million shares and continue to be active with our buyback program as we move towards its renewal in October.</p><p>As noted in our press release, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of CAD0.045 per share, reflecting approximately CAD8.6 million in aggregate payment to shareholders. Distribution is scheduled to be made on September 30th of 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2024. And I would note that those dividends are designated as eligible dividends for Canadian income taxes, income tax purposes.</p><p>So with that, I'll turn things back to Brad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks. My comments will include the quarter and then current and forward-looking observations will be quite similar to our last conference call as not a whole lot has changed since May. Overall, Q2 was better than expected. We continue to be pleasantly surprised that our customers continue to level load their programs throughout the year. I actually expect our past experiences with Q2 breakup is a thing of the past. And I think it's reasonable to expect that in the future, the second quarter will generate positive earnings in our industry, which is a refreshing change. And then we'll, in exchange, we'll see more of a slowdown at the end of Q4 in and around Christmas.</p><p>As always, there was lots of weather and spring thaw delays throughout the quarter, but nothing, nothing that wasn't typical. And overall, like I said, the quarter went very well. Certain of our customers moved Q3 work forward into Q2 to avoid potential water restriction issues that are just the result of ongoing drought conditions in Western Canada. And so that was a significant help to our quarter, but this will come at a cost to our Q3 results. So, the work does move around from quarter-to-quarter. That's nothing to be concerned about.</p><p>Frac revenue was up 30% year-over-year, and EBITDA in that division was up over 50%. So a very successful quarter in our frac division. In general, I would say, cost inflation has basically stopped or is very muted. In fact, there are pockets of, there are areas where we're starting to see some of our costs actually decrease. So that's a welcome change to the past few years, and that helps with, offset a lot of the pricing pressure that we've been experiencing over the last six months.</p><p>We are still operating seven frac crews. We commissioned our fifth Tier 4 fleet earlier in the year, which is, which was designed to operate in the Duvernay and the high-pressure areas of the Montney. We still, I think we still are taking a very disciplined approach to the basin, and we are operating about 60% of our total horsepower compared to our competitors that are running full blast. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the industry, and we will bring back equipment as, as required and at a time when we think we can generate return on all of the hours that it's operating.</p><p>Our fracturing operations continue to be almost exclusively focused in the Montney, Duvernay and Deep Basin, and I don't expect there'll be a lot of changes there in the next few years. The cement division is continuing to operate with high utilization and is generating great results. Q2 was another good quarter for that division, and it's an indication of our expertise and our leading market position in that service line. I think we generated 4% higher revenue and 10% higher EBITDA in Q2 of this year versus 2023. And that's just really a result of, of the quarter being more active in the industry as a whole, especially in June.</p><p>We hold about a 50% market share in the Montney, can be as high as 80% in the Deep Basin, and we continue to, we continue to look at expanding our cement division market share throughout the basin and back into some of the areas that we've previously had to vacate just due to manpower issues. A lot of the manpower problems that we've had with this division in the last few years have really been mitigated here in the last year or two, and we can start, starting to look to expand this division as we're able to add qualified staff. And we continue to invest in technology and equipment and look at new blends for the different parts of the basin, and we continue to expect this division will perform very well in the future.</p><p>On the coiled tubing side, we're making good progress in the coiled tubing division. We've been focused on growing our market share. We continue to operate only seven coil crews. So there's lots of room for growth here. But we did grow our revenue about 18% year-over-year, but we're still struggling with profitability given the scale of this business. And we need to really grow the number of units that we're operating in order to realize the profitability potential of that division.</p><p>We have good field margins. But overall, the scale is just not high enough to offset some of the fixed costs that are associated with operating coil throughout the basin, providing different coil sizes to our customers in any areas that they may want. But we expect that this will be generating attractive financial returns within the next year.</p><p>Now, we're looking forward to our, I think we have discussed this in the past, we're looking forward to the start of our strategic partnership with ACOS [Phonetic], which is a specialized tool company, and that should also help grow our market share in the oilier sections of the basin, particularly where there's multilateral well designs. And this is a re-entry tool that we are going to be using to go back into these wells to evaluate and hopefully increase production from some of these shallower oil, oil wells. And this is a market we're not currently active in at all. So, it's all additive to this division. We're essentially at an inflection point in this, in the coil division. If we can add a few more units, we can significantly increase our profitability.</p><p>Outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the second half to remain busy, especially given where we are with natural gas prices year-to-date. The financial discipline that's been displayed by our customers in the last few years is really showing in the reduction of volatility that we've had from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And with customers only spending about 50% of cash flow, it gives them a really good buffer to sort of look through these temporary commodity price dips or weak, periods of weakness, and they continue to operate, I would say, on a very level loaded thoughtful basis. And so we expect this year to be, maybe not quite as strong as last year, just due to gas prices, but we still expect the second half of this year to be busy.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the forest fire activity and the drought conditions, and this really hasn't played out nearly to the extent that we thought it might even a few months ago. The water issues were basically restricted to certain areas of the basin. We do have active forest fires this summer as we have in the past few years, which can push work around, we may have to abandon certain areas for a short period of time. But the work doesn't go away. It just moves to a different month or a different quarter, and we'll just continue to monitor and make sure that our staff is safe, and we're not getting in the way of forest firefighting activities. But generally, it's just a, it's just a waiting game and as the summer comes to an end, we'll get back to normal.</p><p>Fortunately, the strip for natural gas for this winter and throughout 2025 is still at economic levels. So we're not expecting, we're not expecting this natural gas price weakness to last forever. And as a result, with the gas prices, as always happens, we do experience some pricing pressure, but it really hasn't been terribly significant, and we expect to continue to generate good operating results going forward. Montney will be the focus of our operations.</p><p>The Duvernay is building momentum. It's very fracturing intensive, and I'll talk a little bit about that again, because our customers are excited from the results of this play, both in the southern and in the Kaybob areas. We've been very active. The well results have been great. We expect this to be a growing source of demand for our services. The Duvernay currently represents a very small percentage of production and activity in Western Canada, I think it's less than 5%. And we think that our fracturing technology, particularly the last Tier 4 fleet that we activated earlier this year, is very well suited for these plays, high pressure, low emissions, small, small footprint on location.</p><p>On the corporate strategy side, our priorities have not changed. We want to build a resilient, sustainable and differentiated company, invest in high-growth, profitable opportunities to ensure that we continue to generate returns for our shareholders, and we want to provide a consistent return of capital to our shareholders as well through the dividend. And even though it may be slower than expected for the next few quarters, we're still very bullish on the industry in Canada. We view Western Canada as an attractive basin to develop and grow our business.</p><p>As everybody knows, the LNG export potential, LNG export capacity continues to build momentum. And you've seen that in the rig count, even though we've had weak natural gas prices for the last sort of six months to nine months, you really haven't seen a whole lot of change to the rig count. In fact, it's essentially flat year-over-year. We still believe that Canada is going to play a very important role in providing the world with cleaner, more sustainable energy. The demand is growing from places like the Asia, the Asia part of the world. We expect that our LNG facilities will continue to grow and will become an important part of the equation for many parts of the world when they're thinking about how to get clean, reliable energy.</p><p>We expect that LNG drilling will stay active. It's been active now for the last sort of year or two. We're expecting the first cargoes of LNG to leave the West Coast late this year, early next year, and that provides a great foundation of activity that this basin has never really have. LNG Phase 1 represents about 11% demand growth for Canadian natural gas and Phase 2 double that capacity.</p><p>On the oil side, TMX expansion is now operational. I think it will get to maximum capacity in the next sort of 18 months. But it's, for the first time now, we have more of an outlet for our oil, reducing differentials and expected price volatility of Canadian oil prices. So, everything is coming together nicely. Our customers are still only spending about 50% of their free cash flow in drilling and completions and their balance sheets are in great shape, and so as ours. We've maintained a clean balance sheet for the last few years as we've executed our strategic plan and we'll take advantage of any investment opportunities that we find that will provide superior returns.</p><p>On the sand logistics side, we've discussed this for the last few years that we think logistics is growing in its importance. And we think it will play an ever-increasing role in operating efficiency and profitability, in particular in our fracturing operations. We are, the July 25, we made a press release that we had entered into a strategic partnership with Source to develop the sand transloading facility in Northeast BC, which will service the Montney play, which is the source gas for LNG. And this, this partnership will benefit Trican from both a strategic and a cost perspective.</p><p>Most of the sand we currently use in Northeast BC and the Montney is moved by truck from terminals in Grand Prairie, resulting in a eight-hour to 12-hour round trip trucking time for each of these sand loads. This new facility will allow the sand to be picked up or will allow it to be railed to Northeast BC to a town called Taylor, will allow us to pick up the sand significantly closer to our customer sites, cutting our trucking time by as much as 50%. And that because of trucking times are reduced, it allows us to use more of our internal trucking resources and less third-party resources allowing us to keep that margin that we, we earn on, on our, in our trucking division.</p><p>And Kurt Lucas and Jim, Jim Rukin have done a great job building our internal trucking division, and we continue to expect more good things coming from that. We've grown that division now from about 60 trucks to about 80 trucks in the, year-to-date, which has been a big help to improving profitability in our logistics system.</p><p>This is really important when you think about what's happening from a, from a frac intensity perspective, because the strategic value of being able to have sand in Northeast BC, when you've seen sand volumes grow as much as they have in the past few years on a per well on a per-stage basis. Even two years ago, the basin was only utilizing about 6 million tons of sand and now we're well over 8 million tons this year. Some of these wells that we've discussed previously, you're using 50 to 100 rail cars of sand. So anytime you can take six hours of logistics time out of the equation, you're drastically increasing reliability, especially in the winter months. And it's a big advantage to our customers to have, to have that transload facility in Northeast BC.</p><p>On the equipment side, we continue to differentiate ourselves, further refining our low emission fleet and working towards our 100% natural gas-fueled operations goal. We're the only company in Canada right now that's using electric equipment. It's been very well received. We've added our electric storage system, which is basically a battery system for redundancy on location. It's working flawlessly and provides a great and lowers total energy consumption on location. We're very happy with the performance of the equipment from an R&amp;M perspective.</p><p>The two sets of electric equipment we have today of have now had a few hundred thousand tons of sand put through them with great reliability. The R&amp;M is down considerably when we compare it to conventional equipment, and we expect to activate our third set of electric equipment this fall. When you combine the electric ancillary equipment with the Tier 4 pumps, we're now getting substitution rates as high as 85% on location with natural gas versus diesel.</p><p>And the price differential between natural gas on an energy equivalent basis compared to diesel is significant. Natural gas is very abundant in Canada. It burns cleaner and on an energy equivalent basis is about 1/10 [Phonetic] of the price. So we expect that the industry will trend towards 100% natural gas-fueled operations, and we view ourselves as a leader from an equipment perspective in Western Canada.</p><p>I'll finish up with just some comments on, on investments and return of capital. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and we maintain our clean balance sheet. And we do subscribe to a diversified return on capital strategy through a combination of the base level dividend and the NCIB that we've been active in with over the last few years. But as an oilfield services company, we do experience some swings in our working capital and cash balance.</p><p>And as a result, we've had some comments that our cash balances have been high at times, and it's not an efficient way to operate our company. But between capex, dividends, the transload investment, the NCIB, we expect to spend more than 100% of our free cash flow this year. In fact, we expect to outspend our operating cash flow by about CAD80 million. However, we did start the year with a balance of CAD88 million of cash, so we should finish 2024 fiscal year essentially cash neutral.</p><p>So we do ask for some patience, you do see some, some swings in our cash balance from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but it all makes sense in the long term. We're not afraid to temporarily dip into our bank lines when we find attractive investment opportunities. We will continue to be active in our NCIB program at the right price. I think in the second quarter of this year, we purchased 6.2 million shares, and then since the quarter end, we've purchased an additional 2.4 million shares. We hope to complete our program by early October this year. When you look at the last 12-month spend on the NCIB, it's close to CAD100 million.</p><p>So, we'll continue to spend, we'll continue to spend capital on the NCIB, but we will evaluate that in the context of our other investment opportunities. We're always looking for the best possible returns for our shareholders, and we'll allocate capital accordingly. And today, that has included buying, buying our own shares. But we are seeing more organic growth opportunities that we may be pursuing in the future.</p><p>And I'll just close off with our dividend. And I think Scott had mentioned, we did have a dividend price or dividend increase early this year, and we expect that at the end of this year, we will review the results from our NCIB, and we, we may make adjustments to our quarterly dividend with the target of being we want to spend approximately CAD35 million a year in aggregate dividends, and we'll just sort of adjust our per share numbers accordingly to make sure we maintain those levels.</p><p>So, I think I'll stop there, and we'll go to questions.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brad, you mentioned the second half of the year will be down year-over-year. I guess, I'm just wondering how do you think the trend of activity will play out? And I guess I'm wondering is Q3 going to be weaker and then you see a sort of a pickup in Q4 into the winter drilling season? Or do you see sort of a more typical seasonal pattern where budgets get exhausted and things slow down towards into the holidays?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>No, I do think it will be more typical. I mean with some adjustments, I guess to account for things, you've had some projects get pushed around for water availability or temporary restrictions due to fires, et cetera. And so you may see work get sort of pushed from Q3 into Q4. We are hearing some rumblings that some work from Q1 of 2025 could be pulled back into Q4. So, I think it will be the typical seasonal pattern with some minor tweaks just due to water, fires and individual companies moving, moving capital around. But I don't think that will have a significant impact on it. I think going forward, I think we're going to continue to see strong Q2s, and then a drift off in December, which is great for our industry, right, and the people that work here. It's a welcome change to the activity timing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Makes sense. I guess more importantly, what's sort of the 2025 upside scenario from your perspective? And then more specifically, like do you think you need an eighth frac fleet or a sixth frac fleet conversion with LNGCanada on the doorstep?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think both of those assumptions are very reasonable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Potential timeline for that would look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the lead time on equipment is still fairly significant. The equipment that we have parked to the side is fully operational. It's not sort of theoretical spreads that require a significant capital investment and a bunch of maintenance work. We can, we can take equipment off the fence and put it into the field as quickly as we can staff it. There won't be any delays there. If you want to convert equipment to Tier 4 or any other technology, you do have to start thinking about that six months or so in advance.</p><p>And we're always looking at that every day. And certainly, I think your instincts are correct. It doesn't take much increase in activity in Canada for us to require more equipment in the field. And we fully expect that if fracturing gear gets added to the Western Basin here that we will be the beneficiary of that, and we are the natural provider of additional equipment. But as you know, we're very disciplined. We will not put out equipment unless we get a return on every single hour that it's operating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>You sort of insinuated that labor friction had been reduced? Did I interpret that correctly?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. I think in the industry as a whole, the labor constraints have definitely been reduced. And I think that's a result of the fact that the industry has been operating at a fairly level loaded, or has been fairly level loaded from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. And that is a huge appeal to people wanting to come into the industry. On the oilfield services side, the biggest hurdle that we face is the earnings volatility that we would have from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And so I think people are sort of watching their neighbor get up and go to work every day in all four quarters, and there's been no talk of layoffs anywhere in the industry, other maybe than the odd spot here and there.</p><p>And that's a big change. It wasn't that long ago that there would be layoffs every spring, a lot of changes from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So this is more, this is more in line with what people want from a financial planning perspective, and it's helped tremendously, I think. Our turnover is very, very low. Never, we've never seen turnover levels this low before. In the frac division, our turnover is less than 5%. Historically, you would expect it to be at about 20%. I'm talking about voluntary turnover from the staff. So, I think it's a good indication that earnings stability and predictability is very helpful in attracting people to the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Macneil:</emphasis></p><p>Makes sense. Thanks, Brad. I'll turn it back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>The next question comes from Josef Schachter from Schachter Energy Research. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, Bard, Scott and the team. I have two questions. Given how tight and the fact that you have the remaining equipment on the side for fracking. Is there any concern about the operators in the states given how weak things are, bringing up equipment into Canada?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. It's always a concern and has been for as long as I've been in the industry, which is 25 years or so. And you do see equipment come and go. There's no doubt about it. I would say, the one thing that is working for us is, the two big players in Canada are Halliburton and Liberty. And from what we understand, and I certainly cannot speak for them, but is their US operations are more profitable than their Canadian operations. And so that, I mean, that's always helpful.</p><p>But I do think the LNG opportunity in Canada for, for the drillers and the frackers is so significant that I think everybody is looking at it. And we expect to compete based on quality of service and quality of our technology, and we're happy to do so, and we're happy to compete in case anybody that wants to come to Canada.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Super. And my second question is, can you give us a little more light on the Source Energy deal with the rail and the new facility. Are you guys each going to keep your own customers and the benefit to you, as you said is rail versus trucking? And what happens if there's new customers, do you guys compete against each other? Is there any understanding there? Just to get an idea of what might happen in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. I mean, I won't get into the details of the commercial specifics of it. But suffice it to say, I mean, industry in general is going to benefit from this, this investment. And we would rather be on the inside working through the process than on the outside looking in. One of the positives about working with a partner like Source is that they're an integrated supplier. So they have the sand supply as well as the transload facility and expertise.</p><p>So I mean, you would think about it, that they're bringing that expertise and the operational logistical capabilities to the table to get the sand in the BC closer, and we're partnering in there. We're going to benefit from picking up sand in a closer proximity and being able to use more of our own trucks. And together, this will benefit the industry overall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Do you, do you guys use Source for sand at this time?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>We do. We would be a fairly significant customer for most of the sand suppliers throughout Western Canada for sure. And maybe just kind of a final point on that. One of the big benefits from a Trican perspective is that, if you're a large customer in Northeastern BC and you want security of supply of your sands coming in, you can, we can provide that, right, through this facility. So we would have significant guaranteed supply on the ground from that, from that facility where our other competitors would not be able to offer that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Josef Schachter:</emphasis></p><p>Super. Thanks for the color on that. I much appreciate your thought. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Matson:</emphasis></p><p>You bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from John Gibson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, all. I was wondering if you could expand on pricing discussions. I mean, we've been in the balance here for a few quarters, it seems. And Q1 '25 looks to be fairly active. Are you starting to have more positive discussions around pricing? Or is it still pretty subdued?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>We are maybe a little different than most in that. We've had our customer list, our core customer list, our top 10 customers, 15 customers for years. And so we tend to take a more long-term view of pricing in our discussions with our customers are tweaks. And I think everybody sort of understands the direction of the industry and that things are likely to be tweaked up, not down next year. But generally, our pricing discussions are always fairly subdued just due to the long-term relationships of our customer base. So we're maybe not sort of the best person or the best company to ask as to sort of spot pricing, where some of our competitors are maybe more jostling from quarter-to-quarter with an ever-changing customer list.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. That's fair. And also for me, I mean, you mentioned the CAD35 million in aggregate dividends. Your valuation is starting to move up there, and you talked about the NCIB being somewhat price dependent. Wondering if you could alter this level given where your shares are at as well as the free cash flow generating capabilities of the business, or is that number going to be pretty static going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>I missed, sorry, John, I missed the second part.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Just wondering if that CAD35 million in aggregate dividends you target will be static? Or just depending if your shares stay at these levels, your valuation stays kind of here, you can slow the NCIB a bit?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I'm a shareholder. I would hope the industry would support higher aggregate dividend, annual payments like every other shareholder. And so we look at everything in the context of sort of the next five years and how we view it. So right now, I would say, that's fairly, that level is fairly static. But hey, if there's, what, 6 million, 7 million, or 6, 7 Bcf a day of potential LNG facilities, that could change everything with, we get more, more positive FIDs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Gibson:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And agreed on all fronts. I'll turn it back. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Fedora for any closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Fedora:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks, everyone for joining. We appreciate your interest in our company. We will be available for the rest of the day for any questions that you may have. Please just call us directly, and we'd be happy to help you. Thanks again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-674aaa3df6d6546397e211aa73afca81</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC8-X383-RS0M-G2W8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 AlphaStreet Inc.

An ordinance providing for a special election, for this purpose, was rushed through the city council last night, 6-2.

As a result, firefighters responded to a 1/10 acre fire start near Red Blanket Creek; the fire has been contained and mopped up.</p><p>Along with the lightning, the forest received scattered rain showers and small hail from passing thunderstorms in some locations, but that did little to impact the drought situation.</p><p>\"We're anticipating some additional fire starts from holdovers associated with last night's storm, with additional lightning predicted this evening and tomorrow,\" said Acting Fire Staff Officer Dan Quinones.</p><p>Meanwhile, detection aircraft, staffed lookouts on Halls Point, Hershberger and Dutchman Peak, along with ground firefighting resources, continue to monitor and patrol for any new starts.</p><p>In the extended outlook, more lightning is predicted for Sunday through Tuesday following record temperatures associated with a heat wave this weekend. \"Due to the updated regional forecast, we've ordered additional resources, including initial attack hand crews,\" added Quinones.</p><p>Total resources available for response include: additional overhead, 22 engines, a Type 3 dozer, two 10-person modules, one Type 2 initial attack crew, four Type 1 water tenders, an air attack platform, a fixed wing recon platform, staffed lookouts, the Rogue Valley Interagency Communications Center, the Medford Air Tanker Base and two heavy helicopters.</p><p>Should the fire situation elevate, the J. Herbert Stone Nursery is prepped and ready to become a staging area for additional resources that may be called in. Smokejumpers, SEATs (single engine air tankers) and large air tankers are currently available in Central Oregon.

LaTourette announced today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The New Jersey grant is one of 13 projects funded nationally with $24 million from the DOD's 2023 Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Challenge Program, which facilitates long-term partnerships to improve resilience to climate change, preserve habitats and natural resources, and promote sustainable land uses near military installations and ranges.</p><p>\"The Murphy Administration is grateful to our federal partners for this grant funding, which will help us mitigate the increased risk of wildfires that are one of the many adverse impacts of climate change in New Jersey,\" Commissioner LaTourette said. \"Partnerships such as this help us ensure healthy forests that provide shade and shelter to visitors, keep open spaces green to sequester carbon, and also limit the greenhouse gas emissions that can increase ocean acidification.\"</p><p>\"Warmer springs and hotter, drier summers may lengthen New Jersey's wildfire season and increase the occurrence of large fires. Reducing wildfire risk is a key aspect of ensuring that our farms, forests, and communities that are vital to our state's economy and identity are resilient to a changing climate,\" said Nick Angarone, New Jersey Chief Climate Resilience Officer. \"This REPI Challenge award supports the New Jersey Forest Fire Service in some of its most critical wildfire mitigation and protection projects in the state.\"</p><p>Funds from this grant round will be used to construct a strategic firebreak adjacent to the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in Bass River State Forest, with project work expected to begin in April 2023. Firebreak work will consist of reducing hazardous forest fuels on a strategic strip of land bordering Allen and Oswego roads, in Bass River Township, Burlington County, and in Egg Harbor Township, Ocean County. By reducing the forest fuels, firefighters may more safely control the forward progress of wildfires that may start in this area. The firebreak will also provide improved access to fight any fires that may occur in the area.</p><p>Additionally, forest thinning on 1,305 acres will reduce combustible vegetation known as ladder fuels and improve wildlife habitat. Ladder fuels are small trees and low vegetation beneath the forest canopy. Most large trees in the project area will remain, which will keep the canopy intact. Thinning allows for a healthier forest, reduces competition among trees and provides greater resource availability. The likelihood of a catastrophic wildfire burning through a thinned forest is reduced.</p><p>Additional REPI funds will go toward the ongoing Greenwood Triangle Forest Fuels Maintenance Project in Brendan T. Byrne State Forest and Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management area. This project entails firebreak maintenance and underbrush removal to protect residents in Burlington and Ocean counties and to create safe conditions for firefighters during wildfire suppression efforts.</p><p>This funding will help the New Jersey Forest Fire Service continue to build a network of strategic firebreaks across the landscape and improve resilience.</p><p>Ongoing partnerships like this through the DOD, Naval Weapons Station Earle continues to strengthen the relationship between DOD and DEP. New Jersey's rich history of cooperation with its military installations is reinforced through the funds the DEP has received through the REPI Challenge Program.</p><p>\"The wildfire management activities outlined in these projects not only benefit the military installations, but the natural resources and residents of New Jersey,\" said John Cecil, Assistant Commissioner for State Parks, Forests &amp; Historic Sites. \"Without funding provided through the REPI Challenge Program and additional funding leveraged through the DEP and other partners, these projects would not be possible.\"</p><p>The REPI Challenge Program cited a surge in forest fires adjacent to the Joint Base and Warren Grove Gunnery Range properties, in part due to dry weather conditions and dense accumulations of forest undergrowth, that can fuel wildfires. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service responded to 1,175 wildfires that burned 12,664 acres in 2022. When a wildfire encroaches a military installation, operations at the properties must be suspended, impacting various base and range activities and missions.</p><p>In 2019 the Spring Hill Wildfire burned 9,021 acres just north of the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in Bass River and Penn State Forest in similar forest fuel conditions. This fire highlighted the potential of a major wildfire threatening surrounding communities and military installations.</p><p>Combined, the 13 REPI Challenge projects will benefit 26 installations and their communities across the country. In addition to New Jersey, the DOD is funding projects in Guam, Hawaii, Arizona, Texas, California, Washington and Virginia.</p><p>To date, the REPI Challenge Program has leveraged more than $144 million with more than $417 million in partner contributions to protect more than 51 locations. REPI projects promote compatible land use, restore important habitats, promote species recovery and enhance climate adaptation efforts.</p><p>Warren Grove Gunnery Range is one of the most heavily used Air National Guard training ranges in the United States, and its location provides operational capabilities for all branches of military service. Naval Weapons Station Earle operates a receipts, storage, segregation and issue ordnance facility to support the Atlantic fleet, which includes the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and DOD conventional ammunition requirements.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.state.nj.us/dep/newsrel/2023/23_0014.htm\">https://www.state.nj.us/dep/newsrel/2023/23_0014.htm</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8081096 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8081096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67MJ-5DP1-JC11-148R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><timeReceived>10:15 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 24, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As incredible as it is, this record serves as their final album under the name \"Injury Reserve.\" This is because of the untimely passing of one of the trio's group members, Stepa J. Groggs. The remaining members, \"Ritchie with a T\" and producer Parker Corey, have respectfully decided to leave that name behind them and continue under the new title: \"By Storm,\" an allusion to the final track of this album.</p><p>As for the album itself, it doesn't hold back when it comes to confronting uncomfortable topics such as loss and even conspiracy. The formation of the record was during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and quite a few tracks reflect the swarming fear and distrust that encompassed a significant portion of our society during this time. Notably, \"Wild Wild West\" repeatedly says, \"5G. They putting towers up everywhere.\" The delivery on such a line makes the listener as uncomfortable and weary as Injury Reserve is trying to convey. The production is blaring and every utterance over top comes across as somebody whispering in fear.</p><p>\"Footwork in a Forest Fire,\" \"Ground Zero\" and \"Smoke Don't Clear\" all reflect this similar attitude in their decision to be off-putting as opposed to lulling the listener in with consistent choruses or hooks. These tracks all used to be my least favorite on the album, but honestly, as I've grown older, I realize there's something entrancing and intensely engaging about their anxiety-inducing nature. In some ways, it feels quite genuine for an album like this to be so comfortable displaying fear and discomfort as just as real of a feeling as the others addressed, all with the purpose of being honest with ourselves and human nature.</p><p>Enough can't be said about how much I love this album's opener, \"Outside.\" This song hooked me from the moment I first listened to it. The deceivingly lo-fi production is actually incredibly lush, with static basslines humming while synth lines that are equally jarring as they are catchy simmer in.\u00a0</p><p>It's genuinely hypnotizing to me, and meanwhile Ritchie with a T arrives with a booming voice and delivers a calculated rant that appears to be sizing up an \"enemy\" or perhaps just a sentiment. The antagonistic nature of the song is abrasive in some ways, but also communal in approach, as the mannerisms are so unfiltered and real that the statements feel more bridge-building than maybe even intended.</p><p>\"We cannot end this with an agree to disagree. There's just some things that ain't right - there is no happy medium. That is nothing.\"</p><p>After what feels like a declaration of war against people beyond reason and who recklessly cause harm, the track ends with a headbanging finale that communicates the scope of the album to follow. The melodic catchiness of the song isn't always present throughout the record, but that just makes the rest of the times that much more impactful.</p><p>It can't be made for certain whether or not the song \"Top Picks for You\" was written about the late Stepa J. Groggs, though that was my interpretation for the longest time. However, it feels much more important to appreciate the song for what it is, which is a hauntingly beautiful ballad of grief and loss.\u00a0</p><p>This song may very well be my favorite of the album, because Ritchie with a T is delivering the most potent metaphors to describe the loss of a loved one in ways that will forever impact me. It talks profusely of patterns in place as a result of someone's impact on us, reflecting in some way an aspect of people that will never actually be lost. It's this revelation that's delivered in an equally haunting and beautiful manner, a balance that is quite true to life.</p><p>\"I look across the table, I see a lot more than what appears to be a shadow. He walks across the room, I see a lot more than seems to be patterns. I scan the room, I see bits and pieces of you scattered. It's those same patterns that're gonna get us through the next chapter.\"</p><p>It's the final two songs that I would like to close this article with, though, as they might have had just as much of an impact on me as the prior song.\u00a0</p><p>\"Knees\" is something truly astounding to me. It paints a picture of acknowledging pain as well as finding the fortitude to keep going anyways. Sometimes it's hard to discern whether or not the sentiment of the song is that of tragedy or strength, but I don't think the conclusion needs to be that distinct in order to have an impact. What is more accurate to life, anyways, than that all too familiar muddled confusion between anguish and perseverance. We're constantly growing, but that doesn't always mean we're getting taller.</p><p>\"My knees hurt when I grow, and that's a tough pill to swallow. Because I'm not getting taller. Please, is there any way I can grow?\"</p><p>The finale to the record, \"Bye Storm,\" is the epitome of this perseverance in my mind. It's not a denial of the pain that meets us on life's journey, and it doesn't even say we can't succumb to it from time to time. But what it does convey is something ongoing. The lyrics express uncertainty in the face of pain and the ability to move on, but the music behind the words seem to already know the answer. It's easily the most catchy and melodically sweet song of this harsh record and though it still drives in a glitchy/synthetic style, the triumphant nature is not lost.\u00a0</p><p>\"It rains, it pours, but damn man, it's really pouring. They said you'll cope, but damn man, shit, I don't know man. We laugh, we joke 'cause, man, that's just how they'd want it. It rains, it pours, but damn man, it's really pouring.\"\u00a0</p><p>The lack of lyrical certainty in this coping is something that drives the point of this record home for me, which is that we don't have the answers. Nothing is solved, an album like this just serves as an airing out of very real and vulnerable feelings that perhaps don't have an end goal. It's the acceptance of these ugly and complicated feelings that allow us to persevere. Life keeps going and sometimes that feels tragic. Maybe we won't be able to cope with it. I don't know either. But we keep going, and maybe that's enough.</p><p>I'm going to cut myself short once again with this review, as with most, because I can tell I could truly talk about this album all day. I really can't speak enough to how much this album means to me. Even beyond the lyrical and thematic content, every aspect of this album is so incredibly impressive.\u00a0</p><p>Ritchie with a T's lyricism has such a rhythmic and entrancing flow that he makes simple conversational lines seem like spells, and Stepa J. Grogg's involvement despite his late passing can't be ignored either, as his verse in \"Knees\" truly makes the song what it is. The production is lush and grandiose as ever, and incomparable to anything else I've heard when it comes to both scale and thematic execution.</p><p>Thank you for your time, if you've made it this far. Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions for what I should review next, either new releases or deep cuts, it doesn't matter to me. I really enjoy talking about music and I'm always ecstatic to find something new or talk about something I really love.\u00a0</p><p>As always, remember love. Until next time.</p><p>Anthony Morris is an opinion writer.

This project has been inactive since crews completed treatments on 2241 acres in the fall of 2019. This time, crews are targeting a total of 1509 acres and anticipate ignitions to take 1-2 days, depending on conditions.</p><p>Area residents and visitors can expect to see and hear a helicopter in the area, as aerial ignitions will occur on portions of the burn. Citizens are strongly urged to refrain from using any type of aerial-drone systems near the active project area that could potentially interfere with aircraft operations. Approximately 75 personnel will be assigned to this fire, including an Incident Meteorologist who will advise fire managers on current and predicted weather and an Air Resource Advisor from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality Air Resources Division who will be modeling and monitoring the smoke.</p><p>Smoke will be highly noticeable from the Williams area, particularly the Country Club / Elephant Rocks Golf Course, H.A. Clark Memorial Field Airport, Cataract Lake Park, Kaibab Lake, Ash Fork, Valle, portions of State Route 64 and I-40. Smoke is expected to lift during the day and travel northeast over Red Lake Valley, however cooler overnight temperatures may cause smoke to settle into low-lying areas surrounding the burn location.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/kaibab/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1110022\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/kaibab/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD1110022</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4411574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68BJ-KBM1-JDKC-R2JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><timeReceived>4:23 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Ltd.

According to news reporting originating from Egaleo, Greece, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The increasing occurrence of wildfires, amplified by the changing climate conditions and drought, poses threats to human lives, the environment and the geographically dispersed infrastructures. Such impact necessitates the prompt identification of wildfires so that appropriate countermeasures are taken.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Special Account for Research Grants, University of West Attica, Special Account for Research of ASPETE, Greece. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of West Attica, \"The availability of electronic equipment, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, allows for images from dynamically changing, geographical areas, which must be directly processed for wildfire identification and contextualization. In this work, we identify the requirements and the constraints in terms of computational resources of this workflow, and investigate lightweight CNNs to be used. SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNetv2 as well as ResNet50 are used for fire identification. To simulate the realistic conditions, we have investigated multiple datasets, selecting Forest-Fire and Fire-Flame datasets and images from 3rd party sources and performed cross-dataset identification evaluation. To rationalize the required computational resources and the operation cost, lightweight networks have been selected and compared with ResNet-50, which is more complex. The contextualization, i.e. the detection of elements related to energy infrastructures, has been based on image semantic segmentation, performed through ResNet-18. The identification results, expressed as classification accuracy has reached 96%, with satisfactory results in the cross dataset scenarios, while we have identified five classes from the CamVid dataset which can be used for the contextualization needs.&amp; COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

(Operator Instructions)</p><p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Lisa Wilkinson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications with Centerra Gold. Please go ahead.</p><p>LISA WILKINSON, VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTOR RELATIONS &amp; CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS, CENTERRA GOLD INC: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Centerra Gold's second quarter 2024 results conference call. Joining me on the call today are Paul Tomory, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Chawrun, Chief Operating Officer; and Ryan Snyder, Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Our release yesterday details our second quarter 2024 results. It should be read in conjunction with our MD&amp;A and financial statements, both of which can be found on SEDAR, EDGAR and our websites. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise noted. Presentation slides accompanying this webcast are available on Centerra's website. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.</p><p>Before we begin, I would like to caution, everyone that certain statements made today may be forward-looking and are subject to risks, which may cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or implied.</p><p>Please refer to the cautionary statements included in the presentation as well as the risk factors set out in our annual information form. Certain measures we will discuss our non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the description of non-GAAP measures in our news release and MD&amp;A issued yesterday.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Paul Tomory.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIRECTOR, CENTERRA GOLD INC: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid operating performance and maintained consistent quarter over quarter cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid.</p><p>Our year-to-date production costs are in line with our guidance ranges and full year 2024 consolidated guidance for production costs and CapEx is unchanged. In the first half of the year, we've made good progress executing our strategic plan, focused on maximizing the value of each asset in our portfolio.</p><p>Earlier this year, we announced an additional agreement with Royal Gold, which allows us to assess Mount Milligan's potential to be a multi-decade operation. This was a first key step in our strategy to realize the full potential of this cornerstone asset located in top-tier mining jurisdictions.</p><p>We continue to progress work on the preliminary economic assessment to update the larger resource to include all the drilling completed to date to identify value-add initiatives to the plant and to optimize the mine plan. We expect to complete the study in the first half of 2025.</p><p>Also at Mount Milligan, we have continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program that was initially launched last year, and Paul Chawrun will speak to later in the call. We remain focused on maximizing the value of our molybdenum business unit assets, which are comprised of the Thompson Creek Mine, the Endako Mine and the Langeloth metallurgical facility.</p><p>In the second quarter, we advanced our permitting work at Thompson Creek. With strong collaboration and proactive support from our regulatory partners, we successfully obtained authorizations for additional lands at Thompson Creek mine, which will enable a proposed pit highwall layback.</p><p>This is an important deliverable in the overall permitting process and provides for a long runway of mining activities under the current plan. We remain on track to release the Thompson Creek FS study later this year, at which time we also expect to outline our commercial optimization plan for Langeloth. We're encouraged by the value opportunity at Langeloth in the expected synergies with the Thompson Creek mine.</p><p>With respect to our pipeline of growth projects, we continue to progress work at the Goldfield property in Nevada. Our focus this year has been on exploration on the large land package and looking for more oxide material as well as metallurgical test work to support a lower capital flow sheet to maximize returns on the project. We expect to release an initial resource at Goldfield by the end of the year.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to provide an update on our ESG initiatives. In line with our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining practices, we recently published our 2023 annual ESG report. We've made meaningful progress in our sustainability journey over the past year, marked by significant achievements across the organization, including the following.</p><p>Throughout 2023 and this year, efforts have been made to identify potential efficiencies and greenhouse gas reduction opportunities at the site level with the goal of establishing attainable targets. Second, the number of reportable incidents decreased by 17%.</p><p>Thirdly, we contributed over $3.2 million to community investments and donations across our operations. And finally, we achieved the 2026 gender diversity goal two years ahead of schedule with 38% female representation on the Board of Directors and 33% among officers of the company. As we look ahead, we're dedicated to continuing our efforts to drive sustainable value and positive impact.</p><p>And with that, I'll pass the call over to Paul, who will walk through our operational performance for the quarter.</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CENTERRA GOLD INC: Thanks, Paul. I'd like to start with Mount Milligan safety performance. The operating team continues to embrace the site-wide optimization program, which starts with continuous improvement to our safety performance.</p><p>Year to date, we have seen evidence of this through a significant reduction in high-potential incidents. I would also like to congratulate our Mount Milligan mine rescue team for placing first overall in the northern BC competition.</p><p>On slide 5, we show operating highlights at Mount Milligan for the quarter. Mount Milligan produced over 38,000 ounces of gold and over 13 million pounds of copper in the second quarter. Gold and copper sales were down quarter over quarter, which was anticipated due to the timing of shipments.</p><p>Both gold and copper sales are expected to increase in the second half of the year, contributing approximately 60% of the annual sales. In the second quarter, all in sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $1,234 per ounce, higher quarter over quarter due to lower sales and higher sustaining CapEx.</p><p>The 2024 guidance metrics at Mount Milligan remain unchanged. During the second quarter, we continued our progress on the site-wide optimization program at Mount Milligan that was initially launched last year. This program has been focused on an holistic assessment of occupational health and safety as well as improvements in mine and plant operations.</p><p>While the optimization program is still ongoing, year-to-date, we have begun to see productivity improvements in the low haul cycle at the mine as well as the plant processing costs.</p><p>In the first six months of 2024, milling costs at Mount Milligan were $5.60 per tonne processed, 12% lower than the same period last year. Due to the longer-term nature of the mining optimization initiatives, we expect to see improvements in the unit mining costs in 2025.</p><p>Now moving on to Oksut, starting with safety performance year to date, Oksut is tracking on target on both total recordable injury frequency rate and severity rate. By embracing various safety systems and programs, including our work safe home safe initiative, we are demonstrating our commitment to continuous improvement in our journey towards zero harm.</p><p>On slide 6, we show operating highlights at Oksut for the quarter. Second quarter production was over 51,000 ounces. This is less than last quarter due to the winding down of inventory built up during the operations shutdown in 2022 and 2023. Our 2024 production guidance at Oksut is unchanged with approximately 40% to 45% of the annual production weighted to the second half of the year.</p><p>In the second quarter, all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis were $943 per ounce, which is higher compared to last quarter due to lower sales and higher royalty costs resulting from higher average realized gold prices.</p><p>Absolute cost guidance ranges for the full year of 2024 are unchanged. However, we could be at the high end or potentially exceed the guidance range. If gold prices remain at current elevated levels, mainly driven by higher royalty rates.</p><p>I'll now pass it on to Ryan to walk through our financial highlights for the quarter.</p><p>RYAN SNYDER, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CENTERRA GOLD INC: Thanks, Paul. Slide 7 details our second quarter financial results. Adjusted net earnings in the second quarter were $47 million, or $0.23 per share. In the second quarter, sales were 83,258 ounces of gold and 11.7 million pounds of copper. The average realized price was $2,097 per ounce of gold and $3.79 per pound of copper, which incorporates the existing streaming arrangements at Mount Milligan.</p><p>At the molybdenum business unit, approximately 2.7 million pounds of molybdenum was sold in the second quarter at the Langeloth facility at an average realized price of $22.10 per pound. This annualized throughput rate represents utilization of approximately 30% of the facility's capacity.</p><p>More details on future plans for Langeloth are expected to be provided later this summer with the release of the Thompson Creek Mine feasibility study. Consolidated all-in sustaining costs on a by-product basis in the second quarter were $1,179 per ounce. And our full year consolidated guidance for unit cost metrics is unchanged.</p><p>Slide 8 shows our financial highlights for the quarter. In the second quarter, we generated consistent cash flow from operations before working capital and income taxes paid of $94 million. After routine statutory tax and royalty payments to the Turkish government in the second quarter, cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis for the quarter was $3 million, and we had a free cash flow deficit of $27 million.</p><p>In the second quarter, Mount Milligan generated $29 million in cash from operations and $14 million in free cash flow. Due to the timing of shipments, gold and copper sales volumes are expected to be higher in the second half of the year.</p><p>Oksut used $2 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $11 million in the second quarter. This was impacted by routine statutory tax and royalty payments of $105 million made to the Turkish government. We expect to generate strong cash flow from operations at Oksut in the second half of 2024.</p><p>The molybdenum business unit as a whole used $8 million of cash from operations and had a free cash flow deficit of $13 million this quarter. It's related primarily to activities at the Thompson Creek mine as when loss operating cash flows were breakeven for the second quarter.</p><p>Interest income was $8 million in the second quarter, which primarily includes interest on bank term deposits. We continue to generate significant interest income on our cash balance.</p><p>A key focus for Centerra is returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we were active on share buybacks, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for a total consideration of $10 million. Also, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share.</p><p>Returning capital to shareholders remains a key pillar in our capital allocation strategy. And we expect to remain active on the share buybacks dependent on market conditions. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $592 million This provides us with total liquidity of $992 million and positions us well to execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value.</p><p>I'll pass it back to Paul for some closing remarks.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Thanks, Ryan. We remain committed to delivering consistent operating results each quarter and driving value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to deliver on our strategic plan with the release of the Thompson Creek feasibility study and the Langeloth commercial optimization plan later this summer.</p><p>And with that, operator, we'll open the call to questions please.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: Anita Soni, CIBC World Markets.</p><p>ANITA SONI, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: Good morning, Paul, thanks for taking my questions. First one is with regards to Oksut and the hits sequencing, I think I was expecting a little bit more stripping to be done this quarter. And I'm just wondering if some of that was pushed out into the back half of the year or are you done with this stripping campaign that you had -- that I think that's happening in the first half of the year.</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Thanks, Anita. It's Paul here. We're continuing with our waste stripping through the year, that's relatively even. I mean, its approximately 16 million tonne. So we're on track for that. We did have a little bit of change in our ore sequencing.</p><p>And that was really just to blend our (inaudible) pit, which is higher grade, has a little bit higher clay. And so we needed to adjust our mine or sequencing. And then we did have, as we noted in the MD&amp;A, we did have a little bit of dilution due to the rainy season.</p><p>ANITA SONI: Okay. So you're saying that this quarter you were in a higher grade or conceptually lower quarter over quarter? I'm not -- I'm a little confused about that.</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: No, no. We needed to change the or sequencing timing in larger pit, the (inaudible) pit because we needed to blend some of the higher grade. And when you take the overall the grade was lower. And then of course, we were winding down the inventory that was built up during the shutdown.</p><p>ANITA SONI: And then just a bigger broader question for Paul Tomory. As you think about -- do have some significant free cash flow coming into the back half of the year. As you think about where gold prices sit and where molybdenum sits, does that change your thinking at all and in terms of what gets prioritized in terms of use of cash?</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: In terms of use of cash, the first thing coming down or pipe is the Thompson Creek feasibility study so that that's coming here at the end of the summer. We're happy with where things are at on molybdenum price, but more importantly, we've done a lot of work internally over the last six, eight months on understanding the value potential of the integration between Thompson Creek and Langeloth. And that will be shown when we put out the study results.</p><p>So we really like what we're seeing on the Thompson Creek, Langeloth combination, and you'll see that when we put out our results and our intended path forward. So that remains an area where we will prioritize capital allocation.</p><p>The other -- we're always looking at opportunities externally to add specifically on the gold side. But as you know, things are pretty fully valued out there. And a lot of the assets that come up for sale are not always -- they will have various issues technically or locationally or for another matters. So we're very disciplined in the way we look at M&amp;A.</p><p>So another example is this past quarter, we made a investment in a junior and we think there's good value to be had very early in the chain, partnering with a junior explorers and that forms another key part of our capital allocation.</p><p>So yes, molybdenum will remain something I'm going to talk about in the near term here, we continue to look for opportunities in gold, and that remains a major strategic focus. And by the drill bit as well, we're going to continue drilling. And we're also going to provide updates on our resource models for Goldfield and Mount Milligan by the end of the year. And we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing, particularly at Mount Milligan.</p><p>OPERATOR: Raj Ray, BMO.</p><p>RAJ RAY, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Thank you, operator. Good morning, Paul and team. My first question is on Mount Milligan. Q2 to grades were lower. You did mention it was mine sequencing, but was it more than what you had expected or it was as per what do your mine plan suggested?</p><p>And then looking at the second half of the year, how should we look at grades for Q3 and Q4? And then also on recovery for gold, slightly lower. Should we expect second half recoveries to pick up again like Q1? Or do you expect recoveries to hover around these levels. So that's first on Mount Milligan.</p><p>And then secondly, with respect to the Moly study that's coming up, I understand that once the feasibility study is out, you will decide on what capital to spend, but should we anticipate any spend in Q4? Or is this more a 2025 if and when you decide to spend any capital there?</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Paul, to the Mount Milligan, and I'll take over on --</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Okay. So Mount Milligan, there was a number of questions there. So in Q2, yeah, we had standard mine sequencing, and that's why you saw the grades somewhat lower. That being said, in terms of recovery, our gold recovery, we can expect that to go up a little bit. And that's just some of the initiatives that we're doing on our optimization program. We're calling that M plus.</p><p>So we can expect to see somewhat higher gold recovery for a number of different reasons. And then in terms of the grade going forward to the remainder of the year, I think the best thing to do is just take a look at our guidance, we're on track for that and then that will pan out. We are good, but we will expect a little bit higher grades for the remainder of the year, not exceptionally higher. And I think that was the bulk of your questions on Mount Milligan.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: All right. So on molybdenum, Ryan would have mentioned in his prepared remarks that there was some spending in the quarter at Thompson Creek related to early works activities. We continue to do that. So in anticipation of the projects that are coming in a few weeks here, we continue to prepare the site for potential go decision on the project.</p><p>And so, there has been some spending and there will continue to be spending here through August and into September as we prepare for decision there. If you want more details, Ryan could speak to that, but perhaps that answers your question.</p><p>RAJ RAY: No. That's good.</p><p>RYAN SNYDER: I think, we will guide the spending for the remainder of the year as part of that release. So if we do go forward, we'll be spending -- there is spending now there is early works, as Paul says, it will provide an update for the remainder 2024.</p><p>OPERATOR: John Sclodnick, Desjardins.</p><p>JOHN SCLODNICK, ANALYST, DESJARDINS: Thanks for taking my questions. I guess looking at gold fields. It looks like, I guess most of the planned drilling is done. I'm just wondering if you can give any indication on what you're seeing there maybe cut-off date for the resource estimate. If you're thinking about using the same resource gold price of $1,800 or if you might take that up and how those [column leach tests] have been going?</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: As a reminder, because we did that pivot on gold field where we're looking for here is a principally run-of-mine oxide resource. So we had to prove to ourselves two or three key things. One is that we have sufficient oxide material having temporarily put the sulfides on the shelf. We continue to drill and we are adding to our internal view on quantity there.</p><p>And the column leach tests are going extremely well. We're getting recoveries in line with what I would have expected for a run of mine Nevada oxide. So those are going very well.</p><p>In terms of drilling, we continue -- we will do more drilling this year, and we will incorporate the remainder of that drilling into our resource estimate. With that resource estimate, we'll also put out what the recoveries look like, a high-level view on a flowsheet and then a path forward on engineering and potential path execution.</p><p>Your second question there is would we use a higher gold price for the resource at Goldfield? Potentially. I mean, it's a relatively low risk in Nevada, fairly easily digestible project. We haven't made that decision yet. But certainly, I think what you're asking is a good question. We're going to sing logic as well.</p><p>JOHN SCLODNICK: Okay. I appreciate that color and looking forward to the update there. I guess one other one for me, just kind of a modeling one, but the depreciation has been trending a bit below guidance and just wondering if that's going to pick up in the second half or if you're going to be targeting the low end of that depreciation guidance range?</p><p>RYAN SNYDER: Yeah. I mean, I think it's probably heading towards the lower end of it -- Mount Milligan with the increase in reserves at the end of last year brings down that depreciation a little bit. It will pick up a bit in the second half of the year as we sell more material at Mount Milligan. But I think we're heading towards the lower end of the range.</p><p>OPERATOR: Mike Parkin, National Bank.</p><p>MIKE PARKIN, ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL: Hey, guys. A couple of questions from me. Could you first start off, there's quite a few forest fires in BC. Are you seeing any impact at site or you're at risk of being able to move material in or out?</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Thanks for the question. We pay very close attention to that, of course. At this moment in time, we're actually category two, which is fairly low risk. It's not the lowest category one would be. There was a period of time earlier in the quarter, where we're at Category three. There were a number of fires.</p><p>We had the fire at Jasper and some of the other locations. But no, that's not an issue in our local at Mount Milligan and back in April, we had a fire relatively close to Endako and we were on alert for evacuation there, but that didn't need to happen.</p><p>MIKE PARKIN: And can you just remind us in terms of the forest fire seasonality? Is that something that generally kind of continues through Q3? And then as you get into like, probably I'm guessing kind of late Q3, it dives down and in Q4, it's like a nonissue, it's like snowfall?</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Well, definitely Q4, it's a nonissue. Best way to answer that is we're in a bit of a different climate change. It's always been out in Western Canada that you had May, June was the high-risk period, right after the fresh. But that being said, we've seen risks right early in April, right on through to August and September in the past. So we're on alert right through.</p><p>MIKE PARKIN: Okay. (multiple speakers) yeah, BC was worse. But it's also very worrying to see.</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: At this moment in time, it's not as high risk as it has been in the past, through in the past of this summer.</p><p>OPERATOR: Okay. Just circling back, like you mentioned some pretty impressive cost improvement success at Mount Milligan. Certainly, you guys were highlighting is some low hanging fruit on the site tour last year. With respect to the mining cost improvement, can you give us a bit more color on what are the initiatives like focused that is that, like I know tire, like -- I think, something standing water on roads improvement that seems like some kind of low hanging fruit from sites. Or can you just give us some high level like where you're focused in the near term and where you expect to kind of realize those savings?</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Yeah. So there is always some opportunity on consumables like tires and diesel, perhaps a little bit on powder factor, although we want to be very careful on fragmentation since estimate goal, but the bulk of the gain is going to come from improving the load haul cycle production and productivity. And that's actually already been happening at site.</p><p>Why we're not seeing in the unit operating costs for the quarter is because we did have some residual costs on equipment, some major component change outs. So it doesn't reflect in the operating costs. And so going forward, it's really going to come from the lower haul cycle itself and I'm improving on all the various components there.</p><p>That's where the biggest ticket is. And then, of course, some of the other items like the consumables, as you pointed out.</p><p>MIKE PARKIN: It looks like the efficiency of making the pit bigger. Does that -- I remember from site -- I think it would -- the way I would kind of summarize it was if you guys were expecting equipment, you wouldn't have necessarily picked the equipment that's there now it would seem kind of the wrong size for the operation.</p><p>Does that shape with this expansion you're talking about in Pit sizes, is that you make use of that under-utilized scale of the fleet? Or are you still looking to like as assets mature in terms of rolling stock, do you look to optimize scale going forward?</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Yeah. That's a great question. So if you were to start fresh, you might look at a different fleet, of course, probably the biggest one that I would change right away would be the loaders. The use of the loaders to 994s in the pit, but that's what we're working with. So going forward, we'll optimize those.</p><p>In terms of the change out of the fleet proper, we need to do the decision to capital allocation decision based on what we have and for the long-term expansion, of course, there's a number of different options. We can take a look at extending the current fleet, we can take a look at a larger truck size.</p><p>But then, of course, the larger truck size, you then have to take a look at what the overall productivity is and where you're coming from the different face advanced, and you have a little bit less optionality on that.</p><p>So we're looking at all these options, but I think the overarching component of our current stock and going forward, what would make the most sense, you need to take a look at what we have today and use it in your capital allocation, that's far and away the most important variable.</p><p>OPERATOR: Brian MacArthur, Raymond James.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR, ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. It relates back to the Moly operations and again, the study. You've talked a lot about the potential at Langeloth, and that's only working at some 30% of capacity. When you come out with the details, I assume we're going to get at Thompson Creek study, which is sort of apples to apples to what we did before.</p><p>But the second part of it at Langeloth in that analysis, are you just going to assume the integration of Thompson Creek? Or given I think there's even more excess capacity does the fact that you can actually put the Thompson Creek stuff in allow you to go out and get more third-party materials?</p><p>So we'll not only get the benefit of the Thompson Creek material over fixed costs over larger volumes and things like that, but there'll be another uptick. Is that what we're getting on the Langeloth loss study or to the extent you can comment on that would be helpful.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Yeah. I think you've described the strategy well. One of -- I'd say that the most important component of our thinking on the molybdenum business unit, meaning the integrated Thompson Creek Langeloth operation is that line Langeloth is the principle value drivers, not the only value driver, but it's the principal value driver.</p><p>And by utilizing that fixed cost leverage and increasing utilization of the capacity there, we not only create a strong EBITDA business, but we also to a large degree insulate ourselves from fluctuations in molybdenum price because of the way we would purchase concentrate up from a third party and then sell it onwards to the steel makers.</p><p>So the strategy here is use Thompson Creek as a significant component of filling the capacity at Langeloth. So as you pointed out, we're roughly running at one-third capacity in broad-brush terms. Thompson Creek would fill the second third, which would then allow us to fill the final third with third party material and particularly dirtier or higher copper content cons where we can charge a bigger spread, a bigger TC/RC because we have the very clean con coming from Thompson Creek.</p><p>When you look at the world of molybdenum, interestingly, the two cleanest compounds out there are actually Thompson Creek and Endako. So the Thompson Creek feed con from there will allow us significant flexibility in blending in order to fill that final third.</p><p>So yes, the answer to your question, which you kind of previewed there is that study will be a stand-alone mine feasibility study with its accompanying NI43101, but we will have an entire other section showing the economics of the integrated whole Thompson Creek and Langeloth and you will see that the value is generated in significant part by an optimal use of the roasting facility.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR: Right. But just so I'm clear, would that study assumes 66% utilization of Langeloth or how you --</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Much Higher.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR: So you'll be able to do [100%]. So you make assumptions about what you can do on the other side, we'll get to see all that.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Precisely, yes. But the important part is that Thompson Creek enables that ramp for 66%to 100% because you now have the clean con that you can blend with higher copper percentage cons. So yeah, I mean, we will show a full ramp-up.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR: Perfect. And again, just to be clear that you said the value add is in treating the dirty cons. It's not like you bring in Endako into that something because it's another clean con. So it's still a total standalone unit that you have to look at going forward if you decide to go down that route. Is that fair?</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: Yes, I think if you were to look at this very, very high level strategically, Endako has no place in the plan until Thompson is exhausted. So if you look at a perfect situation here, you run Thompson Creek and then whatever, 15, 20 years later, you then bring Endako into the mix as the next source of clean con, which you can then use. It would not be good for us to open both together.</p><p>BRIAN MACARTHUR: Great. That's what I thought. But I just wanted to confirm. Thanks very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Jeremy Hoy, Canaccord Genuity.</p><p>JEREMY HOY, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY: You guys have made some good progress with the optimization study at Mount Milligan. We saw that been your per ton processing costs this quarter?</p><p>Do you expect to see continuing improvements in the processing throughout the year or have they largely been realized? Am I correct in assuming that those were not factored in when you're providing guidance at the beginning of the year for costs for the operation and that's it.</p><p>PAUL CHAWRUN: Thanks, Jeremy. So first, no, we did not include these gains in our guidance at the beginning of the year. And so -- and then to answer your question, are we going to continue to see gains? So this is a very long-term view. And so, we had some low hanging fruit, recycling some of the steel, which was a big gain.</p><p>We're looking at optimization of our concentrate qualities so that actually improves our overall gold. And so that's why you're seeing some of the gains in the plant. And yes, we're looking at a number of different optimization programs to improve the plant overall, both on recoveries, throughput and also the mine to mill.</p><p>Because if we can have a steady-state and have less disruptions in the plants that actually helps the overall cost. And then lastly, through the winter, that was a problematic area and we've done quite a lot of gains there. So yes, we can expect to see continuous improvement in the plants.</p><p>But just overarching, this is a comprehensive program to put Mount Milligan into a world-class operation. And this was key for the long-range plan. And so we'll be adopting those operating metrics into the PDA and into the plant itself going forward with these demonstrable improvements.</p><p>PAUL TOMORY: I'll use this as an opportunity to plug the PEA. What we're looking at here at Mount Milligan is a very significant potential mine life extension beyond the 2035 reserve incorporating the drilling that I mentioned earlier. We're doing a lot of drilling. We're getting very good results on that. So we're looking at a resource model update.</p><p>We're looking at -- I'll remind that we're currently capped on reserves with tailings capacity. We're looking at incremental opportunities to store tailings and that we're making good progress on that.</p><p>And lastly, as Paul said, we're incorporating these new operating metrics into the way we look at mine and plant operations for consideration in that study. So things are going well in that setting study we're hard at work on, and we still need several months to do that. But we're very encouraged by what we're seeing.</p><p>OPERATOR: And ladies and gentlemen, in showing no additional questions, we'll conclude today's question and answer session and today's conference call.

As a result, companies are moving away from disruptive innovation to more incremental strategies involving their core product offerings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Takeaways</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some large brands, like Chobani, have announced their intention to scale back and focus on innovation in core product offerings.</p><p>Experts see simplified ingredient stacks, novel foods for baby boomers, and plant-based composite products as areas that are ripe for disruption.</p><p>Venture capitalists are still willing to invest in innovative products provided they show appropriate value and relevance.</p><p>\"If you look at what products are in the market today, we haven't seen anything that has really changed the balance of power within the market or that has created a wholly new market for food,\" he told Food Technology recently. \"While we do see some new products out there, most of us are still eating the same sorts of proteins, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats that our grandparents did.\"</p><p>Given the issues the food industry is facing, ranging from consumer behavior shifts to the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the greater food supply chain, there is no question that the food industry is ripe for disruption. Yet, Bailey argues, despite significant investment, many attempts to recast the way we develop, manufacture, and package food over the past decade have failed to live up to their promise. And with large brands like Chobani announcing their intention to scale back and focus on innovation in core product offerings, it may seem like the age of incremental innovation is upon us.</p><p>\"Several companies took forays into new categories and tried to launch these new products as a way to shake up the industry. They thought that's what consumers wanted,\" he explains. \"But, when it came to food, most of the things they tried just didn't take. So, what we're seeing is the bigger companies going back to what they know bestand working on precise tweaks and refinements to existing products that are aligned with their supplier, inventory, and consumer base.\"</p><p>A Time to Reflect and Assess</p><p>Other experts in the industry, however, don't see the end of the disruptive innovation era so much as a much-needed moment of reflection and reassessment. Justin Shimek, CEO and chief technology officer at Mattson, a product development company specializing in innovation, says it is easy to see that the pandemic, and many of the supply chain issues that came with it, have led companies to reexamine their current approaches to product development and manufacturing.</p><p>\"The pandemic accelerated many existing supply chain issues, making it hard to manufacture products that were already on shelves,\" he explains. \"Many companies had to go through stock keeping unit (SKU) rationalizationif you used to have 25 flavors of cake mix and you could only produce 10 because of supply chain problems, you start to wonder, do you really need all 25 flavors? Fast forward a year or two, and you get into the macro inflationary time, and you have to boost the top line purely through pricing actions. This is going to make you think about your innovation efforts, because your strategy can't just be about expanding categories anymore. It has to be about bringing energy and excitement to products so you can drive top-line growth. That changes how you think about future food development.\"</p><p>I don't think the age of disruption is over. I think the age of 'uninformed investment' in disruption is over.</p><p>- Jamie Valenti-Jordan, CEO of Catapult Commercialization Services</p><p>While that brings some companies, particularly bigger brands, back to their core offerings, Jamie Valenti-Jordan, CEO of Catapult Commercialization Services, says smaller organizations are still looking for the next big, disruptive thing. All you need to do is walk through one of the big food expo floors to see it. The biggest changes he sees, however, are in howor even ifthese new products are funded. Without a truly breakthrough concept, he adds, it's nearly impossible to get the capital required to get the idea off the ground.</p><p>\"I don't think the age of disruption is over. I think the age of 'uninformed investment' in disruption is over,\" he says. \"Disruption is still happening, and investment is still there if you want it. But you have to have a truly unique idea. So, I'd say that we're moving to more functional disruption now, as opposed to disruption just for disruption's sake.\"</p><p>Categories Ripe for Disruption</p><p>As product developers consider where to focus their efforts, consumer wants and needs, as ever, remain top of mind for companies large and small. Yet, Jeff Grogg, managing director of JPG Resources, a product and process development consultancy, says that understanding consumer behaviors remains a challenge. While consumers report they want healthier ingredients in food productsas well as more sustainable packagingwhat they say, and what they are willing to pay for at the grocery store are often quite different things.</p><p>\"The Mondel\u00c4\"z International State of Snacking report ... says that consumers want to eat healthier, but they aren't willing to trade off very much to do that, in terms of taste or cost,\" says Grogg. \"And there are things in the report that consumers said that are demonstrably false. Seventy-four percent of people claim to typically recycle the packaging their snacks come in. That's an outrageous falsehood. To start, most of that packaging just isn't recyclable. Two, consumer behavior isn't that good. We wish it were, but it's not. It makes it harder to push bigger changes because we need those kinds of innovations, which can be quite expensive, to work both for the brand and the consumer.\"</p><p>That said, when asked what categories were ripe for disruption, several overlapping themes emerged. Rob Dongoski, a global lead for food and agribusiness at Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm, says that he sees, moving forward, a greater push for companies to simplify their ingredient stacks. With consumers reporting an increased focus on health, they want to be able to feel good about what they see on the food labels of the products they buy.</p><p>\"If you look at a lot of the ingredient stacks today, you see 25 or more items with a lot of chemicalsounding names. Consumers want to see five ingredients or less, with names they can pronounce,\" says Dongoski. \"There's a real opportunity here for food scientists to reformulate these ingredients not only for consumer appeal, but also to find more sustainable options, lower costs, and then lower exposure in the supply chain.\"</p><p>Chris Aurand, open innovation leader at Thai Union Group, says another area that is ripe for disruption globally is food products for \"silver age groups.\"</p><p>\"Everyone talks about population booms and how we need to figure out how to feed everyone by 2050but no one talks about the breakdown of ages of those people,\" he says. \"There are a lot of opportunities for new products for this aging population both in terms of nutrition, as well as sustainability.\"</p><p>Historically, older adults have been overlooked in new product development, with a few exceptions. But Aurand says that today's baby boomers don't want to be eating \"old people food.\"</p><p>\"We have to think about what kinds of foods these will be. They should be more nutritionally dense, with less volume, but still taste good. It's going to be a challenge for food technologists,\" he says. \"We are also going to have to think about how to market these products to make sure they aren't for old people only.\"</p><p>Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association, agrees and says that many baby boomers are more adventurous eaters and also have more disposable income for good food. But they also have health issues that need to be taken into consideration in product development.</p><p>\"As food scientists are thinking about ingredients, they have to think about gut health, lactose intolerance, allergies, type 2 diabetes, obesitythey are going to have to contend with all of that as they try to figure out the ingredients and the unique set of flavors to make up a new product,\" he says. \"But if they can crack that code to deliver an amazing flavor combination into some new breakthrough product that can meet boomer needs, it's going to be a game changer.\"</p><p>Beyond just creating foods for older adults, Kafarakis adds that the industry also needs to be more disruptive when it comes to creating packaging for aging consumers. There's ample discussion about the need to develop more sustainable and eco-friendly packaging, but with baby boomers living and, often, eating and cooking independently well into their golden years, the design of cartons, bags, and boxes should also be considered.</p><p>\"People don't realize that, as you get older, opening a package can be a struggle,\" explains Kafarakis. \"The pharmaceutical industry has made a big push to change caps and packaging. They've done that not just for safety, but also to make it easier for someone with arthritis to open their medication. Pulling up the side of a Cryovac package is quite difficult for someone with arthritis. This is something that branded manufacturers haven't really thought about before but, as so many people are living longer, they should.\"</p><p>Will Plant-Based Products Make a Comeback?</p><p>One of the examples that Bailey highlighted in his report demonstrating the failures of past disruptive innovation was the lack of performance seen in plant-based meat alternative products.</p><p>\"We've seen Impossible Foods. We've seen Beyond Meat. We've seen precision fermentation and companies like Perfect Day. We've seen these companies evolve and grow. But despite a lot of investment, they didn't really catch on,\" he says.</p><p>Yet, despite the fact that plant-based burgers didn't quite live up to the hype, most analysts and industry experts remain quite optimistic about the future of plant-based food products. Even Bailey himself.</p><p>close expand</p><p>Plant-based composite products, like Sobo Foods Pork and Chive Dumplings, are growing in popularity and could be the path to success for plant-based meats.

Photo courtesy of Sobo Foods</p><p>\"Precision fermentation, especially, has applications, particularly with regard to the production of proteins and sugars for new product and ingredient uses, that are very promising,\" he says. \"For example, there are sugars and proteins found in human breast milk that you can't find in nature. If you can create these using precision fermentation, we could create an infant formula product that is closer to human breast milk than anything we currently have.\"</p><p>Other industry experts are also bullish on plant-based products in the future. Grogg likens the nonperformance of plant-based meat alternatives to a \"forest fire.\"</p><p>\"Out of a fire like that comes a renewaland there's going to be new and better products in that space. Beyond Meat was never going to be the destination in that space. It was too highly processed and had too many ingredients. But it was a marker on the way to the future,\" he says. \"As we get to that future, I think we need to get away from the idea of a meat alternative. I think the future is going to be completely new plant-based products that are healthy, convenient, and desirable. We just don't know what those products are yet.\"</p><p>close expand</p><p>Precision fermentation is among the technologies that has the potential to continue to disrupt product development in truly innovative ways. Mariia Skovpen/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p><p>close expand</p><p>Precision fermentation is among the technologies that has the potential to continue to disrupt product development in truly innovative ways. Mariia Skovpen/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p><p>Aurand says, in Asia, companies are making great strides with plant-based applications by not trying to replace or mimic a particular type of meat or seafood but rather adding plant-based products to other types of food applications. For example, he says that products like plant-based shrimp dumplings are gaining the most traction in the Asian market. \"These dumplings are very popular here,\" says Aurand. \"You aren't hiding the shrimp. You give the consumer that shrimp taste in the dumpling, but you aren't making it so they are comparing it directly to a real shrimp.\"</p><p>Aurand adds that he thinks that successful plant-based products will be the ones that don't try to be the \"exact equal\" of a burger or salmon filet but instead try to provide good taste or flavor to a composite product. That's the big challenge that the field has moving forward, he says, figuring out where plant-based applications make the most sense.</p><p>\"Determining where these products can fit is very nuanced,\" he says. \"A lot of smaller companies and startups don't have the capacity or, for that matter, the money to try to create a whole new product category. As we move forward, and work to determine where plant-based foods are going to find success, it's going to require a lot of educationnot just for consumers, but for product developers, too.\"</p><p>Innovation Via Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Any discussion of innovation, disruptive or otherwise, would be incomplete without including the potential contribution of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Flavor giant McCormick and Company made headlines in 2019 when it announced it was partnering with IBM to leverage its ingredient and sensory data to accelerate its product development cycles using AI algorithms. Might AI be the missing ingredient for future disruption across the greater food industry, too?</p><p>Dongoski says, while AI solutions can help food and beverage companies solve multiple problems across their value chain, it's not a \"silver bullet.\"</p><p>\"More and more, we are going to see AI used in the industry, whether you are talking about shrink, streamlining operations, or customer engagement,\" he says. \"AI will be a pervasive technology going forward, no doubt about it. But how it will be used, and what it can actually do, really depends on the question you are trying to answer and what data you have on hand to try to answer it.\"</p><p>It takes money to make systemic change happen in the market. And the money will be there for the right products.</p><p>- Jeff Grogg, managing director of JPG Resources</p><p>The growth and evolution of AI-powered tools, says Barb Stuckey, chief innovation and marketing officer at Mattson, will also help drive future disruption. In the meantime, however, she believes that anyone who thinks that disruption is deador even on holdneed only walk the halls of Natural Products Expo West to see that disruption continues to happen. Seeing those new products makes it clear that there is value for companies to continue pursuing some form of disruption in order to address emerging consumer needs and markets.</p><p>Grogg agreedand said that smaller companies will continue to take the risks that bigger companies won't. And venture capitalists are willing to invest in innovative products provided they show appropriate value and relevance.</p><p>\"I don't think we can say the age of disruptive innovation is over. It's more of a short-term pause and necessary clean-out. There's just been too many products that should have never existed, clogging up store shelves we don't need,\" he said. \"But a reset is good and healthyand there will be more funding out there. Because it takes money to innovate. It takes money to make systemic change happen in the market. And the money will be there for the right products.\"ft</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126569146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4S-K4G1-JCBF-S0T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 29, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters made gains in their battle against a vast wildfire on Tenerife on Sunday after better-than-expected overnight weather helped them keep the blaze from destroying homes on the Spanish holiday island, regional officials said.</p><p>The huge fire broke out late Tuesday in a mountainous northeastern area, quickly morphing into the Canary Islands' biggest-ever.</p><p>So far the blaze, which has a perimeter of 70 kilometres (43 miles), has burned through 8,400 hectares (20,800 acres), or just over four percent of Tenerife's overall surface area, forcing more than 12,000 people to flee their homes.</p><p>Despite expectations of a difficult night, things went \"much better than expected\", Canary Islands leader Fernando Clavijo said.</p><p>\"We warned of a complex situation, with rising temperatures and wind... and it's true the night started very hard with many calls saying the fire was very close to people's homes,\" he told reporters Sunday morning.</p><p>But the firefighters \"worked very intensively\" and got through the night without losing a single home to the blaze, he said, describing it as \"almost a miracle\".</p><p>Montse Roman, technical head of the operation, said overnight operations were \"mainly focused on defending infrastructure and homes on the northern flank of the fire\", confirming there had \"not been any more evacuations or confinement orders\".</p><p>Some 20 aerial units were to join the battle against the blaze on Sunday alongside two more coordination units.</p><p>Late Saturday, Clavijo said the wildfire had so far displaced \"a total of 12,279 people\", citing figures from the Guardia Civil police.</p><p>As the fire spread down the mountainside towards the northern town of La Matanza de Acentejo on Saturday afternoon, Candelaria Bencomo Betancor, a farmer in her 70s, looked on in anguish.</p><p>\"The fire is close to our farm, we've got trucks, vans, chickens, everything... it's a business that is going well but if the fire comes, it will totally ruin us,\" she told AFPTV, on the verge of tears.</p><p>\"They have to do something because the fire is right there.\"</p><p>So far the fire has affected 11 municipalities on Tenerife, the largest of the seven Canary Islands, with the emergency services saying air quality was affected across much of the island \"due to the smoke generated by the fire\".</p><p>The blaze has generated a vast pillar of smoke that now stretches some eight kilometres into the air, rising far above the summit of Mount Teide, the volcano that towers over the island.</p><p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is expected to visit the area on Monday.</p><p>Last year Spain suffered more than 500 blazes that destroyed more than 300,000 hectares, making it the worst-hit country in Europe, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).</p><p>So far this year, it has had 340 fires, which have ravaged almost 76,000 hectares, EFFIS figures show.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Her family escaped unharmed, though her beloved cat, Missy, didn't make it out before a \"fireball\" dropped on the house in early May. But peony bushes passed down from her late mother survived and the blackened May Day tree planted in memory of her longtime partner is sending up new shoots - hopeful signs as she prepares to start over in the East Prairie M\u00c3\u00a9tis Settlement, about 240 miles northwest of Edmonton. \"I just can't leave,\" said Johnston, 72, who shared a home with her son and daughter-in-law. </p><p>\"Why would I want to leave such beautiful memories?\" The worst wildfire season in Canadian history is displacing Indigenous communities from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, blanketing them in thick smoke; destroying homes and forests; and threatening important cultural activities like hunting, fishing and gathering native plants. Thousands of fires have scorched more than 42,000 square miles across the country so far. On Tuesday, almost 900 fires were burning- most of them out of control - according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website. Fires aren't uncommon on Indigenous lands, but they're now occurring over such a widespread area that many more people are experiencing them at the same time - and some for the first time - stoking fears of what a hotter, drier future will bring, especially to communities where traditions run deep. \"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Raymond Supernault, chair of the East Prairie M\u00c3\u00a9tis Settlement, where he said more than 85 percent of the 129-square-mile settlement burned in the first wildfire there in over 60 years. Fourteen houses and 60 other structures were destroyed by the intense, fast-moving fire that led to the evacuation of almost 300 people and decimated forested land. \"In blink of eye, we lost so much ... it was devastating. I can't stress that enough,\" said Supernault, who said he hasn't seen any elk or moose, both important food sources, since the fire. \"We don't just jump in the car and go to the IGA,\" for groceries, Supernault said. \"We go to the bush.\" In Canada, 5 percent of the population identifies as Indigenous - First Nation, M\u00c3\u00a9tis or Inuit - with an even smaller percentage living in predominantly Indigenous communities. Yet more than 42 percent of wildfire evacuations have been from communities that are more than half Indigenous, said Amy Cardinal Christianson, an Indigenous fire specialist with Parks Canada. As of last week, almost 23,000 people from 75 Indigenous settlements have had to evacuate this year, according to Indigenous Services Canada. More than 3,600 people from 15 First Nations reserves in five provinces were evacuated as of Thursday, the agency said. It's not uncommon for Indigenous communities to evacuate repeatedly, Christianson said. A recent analysis of the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation database found that 16 communities were evacuated five or more times from 1980 to 2021 - all but two of them First Nations reserves, said Christianson, who participated in the analysis by the Canadian Forest Service. Fires now \"are so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, a challenge in some remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all, said Christianson, who is M\u00c3\u00a9tis. Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta - a province where about 7,600 square miles have already burned, compared to just over 695 square miles in all of 2022 - said some places burning again this year haven't fully recovered from previous fires. \"It's going to take a long time,\" said McMullen, calling it the worst fire season in Canadian history. \"These are life-altering events.\" Christianson said the effects will be felt for generations, because the intense heat is burning the soil and making it difficult for trees and other plants to regenerate. She said Indigenous communities are increasingly vulnerable because they're often left out of decisions about forest management and fire response, and often can't afford to hire emergency managers. What's more, when fires affect urban centers at the same time, fire suppression shifts to larger communities. Indigenous communities \"really want to be leaders in managing fires in their territory,\" including a return to preventive burning that was long suppressed by the government, said Christianson. The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles of and almost surrounded the reserve, where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, who never experienced a forest fire before this year. \"Last year, me and my wife were talking about how many fires there were in Alberta, then boom! There were so many in Quebec this year,\" said Ratt. \"I was like, 'Oh, my gosh, now we're dealing with wildfires like they are out West.'\" But it also wasn't a total surprise, said Ratt, because summer heat is more intense and ice forms later in the winter and melts faster in the spring. That diminishes their ability to ice fish and hunt for moose and beaver, which often requires crossing a lake to an island. \"Something is happening,\" said Ratt, who believes climate change is largely to blame. \"I think this will be the norm moving forward.\" The biggest concern is whether cultural traditions that have been passed down from generations of elders will survive into the future, said Supernault, from the East Prairie M\u00c3\u00a9tis Settlement. \"Our Earth is changing ... and our traditional way of life is now put on hold,\" said Supernault. \"You can't put a price on culture and traditional loss.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-000001896fa3dbc3a1dbefb37e350001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68YP-2SK1-JDGB-00GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSG1</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CMA3</classCode><className>SPORT HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS173</classCode><className>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Armani and guests evacuated to a boat in the harbor.<br/>The head of the region's civil protection agency, Salvatore Cocina, said arson was suspected in two wildfires that forced around 30 people to seek refuge in boats or on safer parts of the island. Firefighters used Canadair planes to douse the flames, along with ground teams to protect homes. Authorities said no structures appeared to have been lost.<br/>The island's mayor, Vincenzo Campo, told Italian news agency ANSA that two planes were working on putting out the last flames on difficult terrain and that the wind had dropped off.<br/>\"After the great fear of last evening and the night spent at work, Pantelleria is returning to normal,\" Campo said. \"It seems the worst is over.\"<br/>Local officials appealed for any information that would help identify the cause of the blaze, which started in two places a quarter-mile apart.<br/>Pantelleria, located between Sicily and Tunisia, is a popular beach destination that includes ancient archaeological sites and natural geographic formations.<br/>Much of western Europe saw little rain this summer, and drought conditions coupled with hot weather have fueled destructive forest fires.<br/>So far this summer, wildfires in Spain have blackened more than 1,729,737 acres, the largest area since the European Union started collecting satellite data in 2006.<br/>The EU's Earth Observation Program said more torrid weather was forecast for Spain as two \"disastrous\" wildfires burned in the eastern part of the country. The fires in the Mediterranean provinces of Alicante and Castell\u00f3n have each charred more than 32,123 acres, the EU agency said.<br/>Meanwhile, authorities in Portugal reported that a wildfire burning for almost two weeks in the pine forests of Serra da Estrela national park was brought under control. However, officials warned of weather forecasts indicating a dangerous new heat wave would arrive soon.<br/>High temperatures, strong winds and a severe drought helped sustain the blaze in the park, where deep ravines and steep hillsides make firefighting difficult.<br/>More than 1,100 firefighters remained in the Serra da Estrela, keeping an eye out for hot spots and embers that might be blown into untouched forest, the Civil Protection Agency, a government department, said.<br/>The blaze charred more than 64,000 acres of woodland, according to European Union data - about one-fourth of the park's area.<br/>On Wednesday, the fire's perimeter measured 99 miles, emergency officials said, and jumped 177-mile--wide firebreaks that had been cleared since the area's last major blaze, in 2017.<br/>Fire officials said that was an indication the country is fighting a \"new generation\" of wildfires that are harder to stop amid the consequences of climate change.<br/>Temperatures in Portugal were due to start climbing, reaching 102.2 in inland areas on Saturday.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8099839</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6667-JRF1-DY7P-P2VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Columbian Publishing Co.

According to news reporting originating from Shenyang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"With global warming, catastrophic forest fires have frequently occurred in recent years, posing a major threat to forest resources and people. How to reduce forest fire risk is a hot topic in forest management.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"Concerns regarding fire suppression and forest fuel treatments are rising. Few studies have evaluated the ecological effects of fuel treatments. In this study, we used the LANDIS PRO model to simulate the consequences of fire suppression and the ecological effects of fuel treatments in a boreal forest of the Great Xing'an Mountains, China. Four simulation scenarios were designed, focusing on whether to conduct fuel treatments or not under two fire-control policies (current fire suppression policy and no fire suppression policy). Each scenario contains nine fuel treatment plans based on the combinations of different treatment methods (coarse woody debris reduction, prescribed burning, coarse woody debris reduction plus prescribed burning), treatment frequency (low, medium, and high), and treatment area (large, medium, and small). The ecological effects of the fuel treatments were evaluated according to the changes in fire regimes, species succession, and forest landscape patterns to find a forest fuel management plan that is suitable for the Great Xing'an Mountains. The results showed that long-term fire suppression increases fuel loads and the probability of high-intensity forest fires. The nine fuel management plans did not show significant differences in terms of species succession and forest landscape patterns while lowering forest fire intensity, and none of them were able to restore historical vegetation structure and composition.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results consolidate the foundation for the practical performance of forest fuel treatments in fire-prone forest landscapes. We suggest a suitable fuel treatment plan for the Great Xing'an Mountains, with a low treatment frequency (20 years), large treatment area (10%), and coarse woody debris reduction, plus the prescribed burning measure.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluations on the Consequences of Fire Suppression and the Ecological Effects of Fuel Treatment Scenarios in a Boreal Forest of the Great Xing'an Mountains, China.

A recent analysis of the Canadian Wildland Fire Evacuation database found that 16 communities were evacuated five or more times from 1980\u20132021 \u2014 all but two of them First Nations reserves, said Christianson, who participated in the analysis by the Canadian Forest Service.</p><p>Fires now \u201care so dangerous and so fast-moving\" that evacuations increasingly are necessary, a challenge in some remote communities where there might be one road in, or no roads at all, said Christianson, who is M\u00e9tis.</p><p>Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and fire chief in Red Deer, Alberta \u2014 a province where about 7,600 square miles (19,800 square kilometers) have already burned, compared to just over 695 square miles (1,800 square kilometers) in all of 2022 \u2014 said some places burning again this year haven't fully recovered from previous fires.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time,\u201d said McMullen, calling it the worst fire season in Canadian history. \u201cThese are life-altering events.\u201d</p><p>Christianson said the effects will be felt for generations, because the intense heat is burning the soil and making it difficult for trees and other plants to regenerate.</p><p>She said Indigenous communities are increasingly vulnerable because they're often left out of decisions about forest management and fire response, and often can't afford to hire emergency managers. What's more, when fires affect urban centers at the same time, fire suppression shifts to larger communities.</p><p>Indigenous communities \u201creally want to be leaders in managing fires in their territory,\u201d including a return to preventive burning that was long suppressed by the government, said Christianson.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of and almost surrounded the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>\u201cLast year, me and my wife were talking about how many fires there were in Alberta, then boom!

That diminishes their ability to ice-fish and hunt for moose and beaver, which often requires crossing a lake to an island.</p><p>\u201cSomething is happening,\u201d said Ratt, who believes <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/global-heat-climate-extremes-2023-95f6861b1312ead54ed941524fa7d2ab\">climate change</url> is largely to blame. \u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward.\u201d</p><p>The biggest concern is whether cultural traditions that have been passed down from generations of elders will survive into the future, said Supernault, from the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement.</p><p>\u201cOur earth is changing ... and our traditional way of life is now put on hold,\u201d said Supernault. \u201cYou can't put a price on culture and traditional loss.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

That diminishes their ability to ice-fish and hunt for moose and beaver, which often requires crossing a lake to an island.</p><p>\u201cSomething is happening,\u201d said Ratt, who believes <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/global-heat-climate-extremes-2023-95f6861b1312ead54ed941524fa7d2ab\">climate change</url> is largely to blame. \u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward.\u201d</p><p>The biggest concern is whether cultural traditions that have been passed down from generations of elders will survive into the future, said Supernault, from the East Prairie M\u00e9tis Settlement.</p><p>\u201cOur earth is changing ... and our traditional way of life is now put on hold,\u201d said Supernault. \u201cYou can't put a price on culture and traditional loss.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Fires burned 18.5 million hectares \u2014 three times the size of Nova Scotia, and eight times greater than the average annual area burned over the past 25 years. Smoke and flames triggered the evacuation of 200,000 residents and ignited nation-wide calls for large-scale investment in preventative action to create wildfire-ready homes and communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new report, by the University of Waterloo\u2019s Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, offers practical guidance to help Canadians living in forested and grassland regions to follow well-tested actions that can reduce the risk of their home burning by up to 75 per cent.</p><p>The report consolidates two plain language, image-based infographics, designed to accelerate implementation of practical actions.</p><p>Three Steps to a Cost-Effective FireSmartTM Home is a step-wise guide to upgrade homes to resist wildfire. Initiatives can include storing wood away from the house and removing shrubs and other flammable material abutting the foundation. More complex initiatives include installing Class A fire-rated roofing made from asphalt, cement fibre or metal, which can limit the potential for embers to ignite a roof.</p><p>Three Features of a Wildfire-Ready Community provides guidance to limit risk beyond the home, such as removing tree branches close to power lines, incorporating fire breaks into community design, completing annual emergency training exercises, and ensuring adequate water supply for firefighting.</p><p>Sixty per cent of Canadian communities are vulnerable to wildfire due to their proximity to forests and grasslands. Wildfire risk in these communities is escalating due to expanding urban and industrial development, lack of nationally accepted building standards to safeguard against wildfire, the accumulation of flammable vegetation adjacent to structures, and an increase in the fuel surrounding communities as a consequence of 100 years of fire suppression. These factors are further exacerbated by climate change.</p><p>\u201cClimate change is lengthening the wildfire season, contributing to larger, more destructive wildfires, and impacting areas across Canada that historically were not regarded as wildfire-prone, such as the Halifax-area wildfire that destroyed over 200 buildings in 2023,\u201d explained study co-author Cheryl Evans, Director, Flood and Wildfire Resilience, Intact Centre.</p><p>The report presents a user-friendly synthesis of best practice guidance developed primarily by the National Research Council of Canada, and FireSmartTM Canada, a national program operated by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre that has been helping communities improve wildfire resilience for 30 years.</p><p>\u201cWildfire is a fact of life in Canada,\u201d said Dr. Mike Flannigan, BC Innovation Research Chair, Fire Science, Thompson Rivers University. \u201cThis report helps to translate climate change and wildfire research into practical guidance that residents and community leaders can apply to learn to live with wildfire.\u201d</p><p>Living with wildfire can be site-specific. As Simon Mass\u00e9, Risk Mitigation Coordinator, SOPFEU, explains, \u201cthere is no one-size-fits-all solution to help residents and communities address their unique wildfire risks. This report helps to raise awareness about the variety of tools that are available.\u201d</p><p>Michael Norton, Director General, Northern Forestry, Natural Resources Canada, highlights that the report \u201cprovides concise, user-friendly guidance that fosters participation, raises awareness, and supports on the ground action from the whole-of-society to strengthen home and community wildfire resilience.\u201d</p><p>The report will help Canada meet the targets set out in its new (2023), and first, National Adaptation Strategy, notably: \u201cCommunities, including northern and Indigenous communities, in zones of high risk, as identified by provinces and territories, develop wildfire community prevention and mitigation plans by 2030, with up to 15 per cent implemented by 2028.\u201d</p><p>Canada\u2019s need to prepare for the growing risk of wildfire cannot be overstated, as Fire Chief Jason Brolund, who was on the front lines of West Kelowna\u2019s 2023 fire season emphasizes: \u201cI look forward to sharing this report to help folks in my community understand the many practical ways we can put boots on the ground today to help reduce West Kelowna\u2019s future wildfire risk.\u201d</p><p>As emphasized during the COP 28 talks, Canadians living in forested and grassland regions do not have to be victims of circumstance relative to wildfire risk\u2014 by preparing wildfire-ready homes and communities today, Canadians can minimize the financial and social burden of hotter and drier wildfire seasons tomorrow.</p><p>Contact details: Ryon JonesMedia relations manager,226-339-0894 |\u00a0@uwaterloonews|\u00a0uwaterloo.ca /news</p><p>Cheryl Evans Director, Flood and Wildfire Resilience, Intact Centre on Climate AdaptationUniversity of Waterloo 226-338-4815 | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:c8evans@uwaterloo.ca\">c8evans@uwaterloo.ca</email></p><p>Dr. Anabela BonadaManager and Research Associate, Intact Centre on Climate AdaptationUniversity of Waterloo 519-574-3631 | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:abonada@uwaterloo.ca\">abonada@uwaterloo.ca</email></p><p>Dr. Blair Feltmate Head, Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation University of Waterloo 226-339-3506 | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bfeltmate@uwaterloo.ca\">bfeltmate@uwaterloo.ca</email></p><p>For French media requests:M\u00e9lie MonneratProject Manager, Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation University of Waterloo 438-994-5720| <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mmonnerat@uwaterloo.ca\">mmonnerat@uwaterloo.ca</email></p><p>\u00a0</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-9005963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WV-R191-JDPV-B3P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

According to news originating from Saint-Petersburg State University by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Postpyrogenic soil dynamics is an informative tool for studying soil elementary processes in extreme temperature conditions and for predicting short time environmental changes in conditions of catastrophic landscape changes. Soil organic matter (SOM) system evolution is the most rapid process of postpyrogenic soil development.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Saint-Petersburg State University: \"In this relation, the focus on humus structure is important for understanding these important dynamics. Soil restoration after spontaneous forest fires near Togljatty City (Samara Region, Russia) was abandoned in 2010 and further monitoring over the next ten years was organised to evaluate the speed of humus accumulation dynamics. The aim of this study was to apply the 13C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to analyse the effect of forest fires on SOM degradation in Scotch pine forests on Psamment Entisols of the fragmented steppe in the Samara Region. Three key soil plots were studied for estimating SOM quality changes under the forest fire effect: surface forest fire, crown forest fire and control, i.e. 18 soil samples of top soil horizons were analysed in three replicates. The data obtained indicate that the humus molecular composition was substantially affected by the wildfires. Investigation of the humic acids' (HAs) molecular structure by 13C-NMR showed a relative increase in aromatic compounds and decrease in aliphatic ones. The aromaticity degree of HA molecules increases in 5.7 and 3.8 times in cases of surface and crown forest fires, correspondingly. In general, crown and surface fires plots are not very different in terms of 13C-NMR spectra of HAs (p = 0.34); however, HAs of control plot have essential differences from pyrogenic ones (p &lt; 0.05).\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"13C NMR spectra have shown a change in the proportion of oxygen-containing functional groups as well. One of the most important effects observed in wildfire-affected SOM is that the proportion of lignin-like structures increases as a concomitant effect of depletion of C,H-alkyl groups, especially in the case of crown fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Characteristics of humic acids isolated from burned and unburned topsoils in sub-boreal Scotch pine forests by 13C-NMR spectroscopy.

He said Billings firefighters were gathered at the fire hall Thursday night for a meeting when the fire call rang.</p><p>The blaze in the 1000 block of Estey Road, west of James Road, was less than a mile from the station. Rottman said the fire started on the outside of the house.</p><p>\"The way it happened, the fire went up and in, not in and out of the house,\" Rottman said. \"It never hit the grow area.\"</p><p>Rottman said the house renter was alerted to the flames by a neighbor telling him the house was on fire. The renter then called 911. The homeowner lives out of state.</p><p>The chief said 1,750 gallons of water were used to extinguish the flames. The cause of the fire is unknown.</p><p>Beaverton Area Fire Department, Bay County's Mount Forest Fire Department, and Gladwin Fire Department all aided in battling the fire.</p><p>Rottman said the firefighters stopped the fire right above the kitchen, saying that the house was not a total loss. He said it needs a new roof, cleanup, and exterior work. There were a few spots where the roof collapsed on itself.</p><p>\"The structure is still solid,\" the chief said.</p><p>Rottman said this was his first fire as chief and that it was \"different.\" Instead of acting as captain and overseeing a certain command, he had to take control of the whole situation.</p><p>\"It was a different feeling, now that I'm responsible for everything and everyone's safety,\" Rottman said.</p><p>He said as chief he ran the pumper truck, made calls, such as to Consumers Energy, and assigned positions of the firefighters.</p><p>Rottman has been with the Billings Township Fire Department for nearly a decade and has 36 years in fire service. Before being named chief, Rottman served as interim chief since the Feb. 5 death of longtime fire chief Al Vincent.</p><p>___ (c)2023 the Midland Daily News (Midland, Mich.)

It is also becoming harder to imagine a secure future for one of nature's most captivating animals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through her Remembering Wildlife project, British photographer Margot Raggett is fighting against this trend. She started the initiative in 2016, and every year since then it has produced a photo book dedicated to one type of animal, capturing its beauty in images from across the globe. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All profits are donated to conservation efforts for that animal, with more than \u00a31 million ($1.2 million) raised since the project began, according to Remembering Wildlife. In this year's edition, the leopard takes center stage.</p><p>Over 50 wildlife photographers have contributed to the book, including Maasai Mara-based Jonathan and Angela Scott, presenters of TV show Big Cat Tales, as well as award-winning conservation photographers Neil Aldridge and Suzi Eszterhas.</p><p>Raggett believes that showcasing beautiful images of the big cat raises awareness and captures the public's attention.</p><p>\"We need people to see what we might lose if conservation efforts aren't successful,\" she says. \"Photography is a great way to do that.\"</p><p>Almost all leopard populations are decreasing. The only exception is the Amur leopard, which lives in northern China and eastern Russia, and whose habitat has roughly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/success-stories/amur-leopard-range-has-expanded-three-fold-just-over-20-years\">tripled</url> since the beginning of the century thanks to conservation efforts. But it remains the world's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amur-leopard\">rarest</url> big cat, according to WWF.</p><p>Out of the nine leopard subspecies, two are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bornfree.org.uk/articles/why-leopards-need-your-help\">classified</url> as endangered and another two as critically endangered. Some subspecies have seen an estimated population decline of up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bornfree.org.uk/articles/why-leopards-need-your-help\">90%</url> in recent years.</p><p>Finding solutions</p><p>Ecologist Dr Vidya Athreya, from the non-profit Wildlife Conservation Society, wrote a section of the book titled \"Lessons from a leopard.\" She tells CNN she has been working on leopard conservation for the last two decades. \"The more I learn about them the more fascinated I am,\" she says. \"This book showcases the amazing species that leopards are, so it has been inspirational to get involved in something that showcases their aura.\"</p><p>\"[Conservation] is about reviving populations,\" Athreya adds. \"It is about ensuring people and leopards do not get embroiled in conflict.\"</p><p>Raggett says that climate change and expanding human populations are forcing leopards into ever-smaller areas. As a result, they are coming into closer contact with humans, becoming more susceptible to snare traps and targeted poaching. Leopard attacks on livestock in places such as Afghanistan are also leading to further conflict, with farmers killing big cats to protect their livelihood, according to Raggett.</p><p>Conservation efforts funded by Remembering Wildlife have provided farmers in Afghanistan with predator-proof corrals to house their livestock, as well as education on other protective measures, she says.</p><p>\"It's about persuading the local community not to retaliate against animals ... and enabling them to live alongside them,\" explains Raggett. Jonathan Scott, one of the photographers who contributed to the book, says that over the years, leopards have suffered greatly because of demand for their pelts.</p><p>\"The leopard's exquisite beauty has cost it dearly,\" he says. \"In the 1960s and 70s as many as 50,000 leopards were believed to be killed each year in Africa to satisfy the fashion industry's insatiable appetite for spotted cat skin garments.\"</p><p>Remembering Wildlife helps tackle the threat of hunting by funding rangers, supporting them in confronting poachers. It can be as simple as paying for fuel, new tires or salaries to keep efforts alive, says Raggett.</p><p>But despite her efforts, Raggett admits work still needs to be done.</p><p>\"Remembering Wildlife is like one hose fighting a forest fire,\" she says. \"We're proudly standing alongside lots of amazing organizations with that hose.\"         </p><p>             By Callum Sutherland, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
