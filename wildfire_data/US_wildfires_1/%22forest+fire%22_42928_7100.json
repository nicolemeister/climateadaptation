Dangerously hot and dry weather is forecast for the next few days, with an excessive heat warning extended through Thursday.</p><p>The South Coast Air Quality Management District has issued a smoke warning that will be in effect through Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Winds were expected to push smoke to the north and east into the Angeles National Forest and western parts of San Bernardino National Forest Tuesday evening, impacting Duarte, Azusa and Glendora, according to the AQMD. On Wednesday morning, the wind is expected to shift and push smoke to Glendora, Upland, Arcadia and Baldwin Park.</p><p>According to the U.S. Forest Service, fuels and rugged steep terrain in the fire area \"are the main cause for upslope runs. Active fire behavior continues after the afternoon inversion lift. Fuels are critically dry.\"</p><p>The fire made it to Pine Mountain Peak, but had not damaged radio repeaters located on the peak as of 8 a.m. Tuesday, the Forest Service said. There were 456 firefighters assigned to the blaze.</p><p>No structures have been damaged, and no injuries reported.</p><p>All earlier evacuations orders have been lifted, but the following road closures remain in effect:</p><p>-- San Gabriel Canyon Road/Highway 39: closed at Northbound Hwy 39 at Sierra Madre Avenue (southbound Highway 39 is closed at East Fork Road);</p><p>-- Glendora Mountain Road: closed from Big Dalton to East Fork;</p><p>-- Glendora Ridge Road: closed from Glendora Mountain Road to Mt. Baldy Road; and</p><p>-- Santa Anita Canyon Road: closed from Arno Drive to Chantry Flats Road.</p><p>The Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from very high to extreme and moved into full fire-restriction mode, including prohibiting campfires in developed sites. Cooking stoves, lanterns and similar devices that use propane, white gas or similar fuels are prohibited.</p><p>The fire was reported about 2:45 p.m. Thursday near North San Gabriel Canyon Road and North Ranch Road, according to the Azusa Police Department and Los Angeles County Fire Department, which called in a second-alarm response.</p><p>A witness who lives in a riverbed near Mountain Cove said an argument between two homeless men sparked the fire, which came dangerously close to homes.</p><p>\"There were two gentlemen in the back (of a homeless encampment) fighting and they were arguing over a bike and one guy said he'd burn the other guy out, and things got escalated to where the fire started,\" evacuee Jimmy Pockets told NBC4. \"Ran over to try to put it out, but it just took off so quick.\"</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency Tuesday to help ensure resources to combat multiple fires burning across the state.</p><p>\"We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions,\" Newsom said. \"California and its federal and local partners are working in lockstep to meet the challenge and remain vigilant in the face of continued dangerous weather conditions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-AZUSAFIREHOMELESSMANCHARGEDWITHSTARTINGAZUSAWILDFIRE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MH-TC01-JCBD-102H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><timeReceived>6:13 PM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City News Service, Inc.

Scores of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, although authorities have been unable yet to provide detailed figures.</p><p>Shifting winds and new flashpoints Friday afternoon caused the blazes outside Athens and Evia to repeatedly change direction, in some cases returning to threaten areas that had narrowly escaped destruction earlier this week.</p><p>After burning through forests and houses towards Lake Marathon, the capital's main water reservoir, a branch of the fire headed off into the Mount Parnitha national park - one of the last remaining substantial forests near Athens, which already bore deep scars from wildfires in 2007.</p><p>A 38-year-old volunteer firefighter died after a falling utility pole struck his head in an area north of Athens affected by the fire, officials said. At least 20 people have required treatment nationwide.</p><p>The causes of the fires are under investigation. Hardalias said three people were arrested Friday - in the greater Athens area, central and southern Greece - on suspicion of starting blazes, in two cases intentionally. Police said the suspect detained north of Athens had allegedly lit fires at three separate spots in the area ravaged by the large blaze, which first broke out Tuesday.</p><p>In the village of Limni on Evia, residents and vacationers were urged to hasten to the harbor and await embarkation after flames cut off all other means of escape. Two ferry boats picked up about 1,000 people, and one more would remain at Limni to take on later arrivals, the coast guard said.</p><p>Earlier in the day and late Thursday the coast guard evacuated nearly 700 people from other parts of the island, using patrol vessels, fishing boats and other private vessels.</p><p>\"We're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,\" Sotiris Danikas, head of the coast guard in the town of Aidipsos on Evia, told state broadcaster ERT, describing the earlier sea evacuation.</p><p>A coast guard vessel also rescued 10 people trapped on a beach by another fire near the town of Gythio in the southern Peloponnese region.</p><p>President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed deep gratitude to all involved in the firefighting effort during a visit to the Fire Service headquarters Friday. She added: \"We are all vulnerable to fire. There is much that needs to be done, both on a large and a small scale. But now we must display self-restraint and unity.\"</p><p>Greek and European officials have blamed climate change for the multiple fires burning through southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey.</p><p>In Italy, firefighters battling a wildfire in the province of Reggio Calabria found the bodies of a man and a woman in an olive grove. LaPresse news agency said they died of smoke inhalation.</p><p>Massive fires have been burning across Siberia in Russia's north for weeks, while hot, bone-dry, gusty weather has also fueled devastating wildfires in California.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its most protracted heat wave in three decades, with temperatures soaring to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, although it was cooler Friday.</p><p>At least 20 people have been treated for injuries from the fires. Two firefighters were in intensive care in Athens, while another two were hospitalized with light burns.</p><p>More than 1,000 firefighters and nearly 20 aircraft are now battling major fires across Greece, while extra firefighters, planes, helicopters and vehicles were arriving from France, Switzerland, Romania, Cyprus, Croatia, Israel, Sweden and the U.S. Some 80 French and 40 Cypriot firefighters joined in efforts to fight the blazes north of Athens.</p><p>In Turkey, authorities on Friday evacuated six more neighborhoods near the Mugla province town of Milas as a wildfire fanned by winds burned some 3 miles from a power plant. Two other neighborhoods were also evacuated as a precaution later in the day, as another fire spread from the region of Yatagan, in Mugla, toward the edge of the neighboring province of Aydin, further north.</p><p>At least 36,000 people were evacuated to safety in Mugla province alone, officials said.</p><p>Excavators formed firebreaks to keep flames from the Yenikoy power plant, the second such facility to be threatened in the region.</p><p>Wildfires near the tourism resort of Marmaris, also in Mugla, were largely contained by late Thursday, while by Friday afternoon the two main fires in neighboring Antalya province were brought under control.</p><p>In Greece, the Athens fire halted traffic on the main highway connecting the capital to the north of the country and damaged electricity installations. The power distribution company announced rolling cuts in the wider capital region to protect the electrical grid.</p><p>In the Drosopigi area, resident Giorgos Hatzispiros surveyed the damage to his house Friday morning, the first time he was seeing it after being ordered to evacuate the previous afternoon. Only the charred walls of the single-story home remained, along with his children's bicycles, somehow unscathed in a storeroom. Inside, smoke rose from a still-smoldering bookcase.</p><p>\"Nothing is left,\" Hatzispiros said.</p><p>In the southern Peloponnese region dozens of villages and settlements were evacuated, and a blaze was stopped before reaching monuments at Olympia, birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games.</p><p>The fires also disrupted COVID-19 vaccinations. The Health Ministry announced the suspension of vaccinations at centers in fire-affected areas.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address Thursday that the wildfires display \"the reality of climate change.\"</p><p>In 2018, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire engulfed a seaside settlement east of Athens.</p><p>Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

At that time, he shared a platform for growth for Sysco. Since then, Kevin and the team have proven just that. That platform now recognized as the Recipe for Growth has enabled Sysco to gain share and perhaps, most importantly, do so profitably.</p><p>Please join me in welcoming Sysco. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN P. HOURICAN: Okay. Great. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate Andrew and the CAGNY Board having us here. It's an honor and privilege for our opportunity to be here with you again. It's nice to be back in person 3 years since the last time we were together, our 2 virtual years in a row. It just does not replace or match the opportunity for us to be able to be in a room, and we look forward to the breakout that we have directly after this.</p><p>And as Andrew just said, we're really looking forward to dinner. Our culinary experts will be in that room. We've got cuisine stations from across our portfolio of products, and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk with you one-on-one this evening, if you are able to make it.</p><p>So without further ado, let's go ahead and jump in. Many of you know a lot about Sysco. But as I talk about Sysco and communicate who we are to our employees, to our investors, I start with this, which is we are a 50% a supply chain organization, and we are 50% a food sales and marketing company. We need to do both, and we need to do both extremely well to continue to lead the industry.</p><p>And today, I'm going to talk with you about how we are doing exactly that, the transformation that is happening within our supply chain and the transformation that is happening within our food sales and marketing group.</p><p>But let's start with some of the most basic facts. We are today the leader in this industry. We have the most broad and capable supply chain with the most number of distribution nodes in the industry. What that means specifically is that we are the closest to our end customer, which means we can get there at the lowest net landed cost and an extremely high level of service.</p><p>We have the largest sales organization on the planet from a food distribution, food away-from-home perspective, 7,500 sales rep-strong, best trained in the industry. And statistically, they have the highest Net Promoter Score by a wide margin in the industry. So robust, strong capabilities and the Recipe for Growth that Andrew just communicated a moment ago is how we're going to take those capabilities to the next level.</p><p>So a little bit more about Sysco and who we are. Again, where we are the global food service distributor. We call ourselves the backbone of the food-away-from-home industry. Some just fun stats on the chart from the overall size of the company. To the number of countries we compete within, to be crystal clear on this component, we operate within 10 countries, but we do business in 90-plus countries. And the difference between those 2 things is the food export business that we own called IFG, which is a nice little growth engine for our company, based in Florida but expanding its reach across the world.</p><p>71,000 colleagues, as I mentioned, 7,500 sales reps who are absolute experts in food. They are ex-chefs, they are ex-restaurant owners, they are culinary school grads, they have a tremendous passion for food. And our delivery partners are the face of this company. They are who in our customers' place of business every week, and they create lasting relationships with our customers.</p><p>Our total addressable market is more than $350 billion, and we are the industry leader, but yet we have only 17% market share. Highly fragmented market, a growing market, which I'm going to get to in a minute, and we have an opportunity to do really, really strong profit business growth in this space.</p><p>I love this chart. The left-hand side is a 30-year span. The bottom line going upward is the food-away-from-home percent to total sales. The other line is the grocery store channel and it's been coming down over that same period of time. That huge dislocation was 3 years ago, 1 month from today, when COVID hit, we were all told to go home, stay home, don't leave your homes. And obviously, you can see that had a tremendously negative impact on our business for a reasonably short period of time.</p><p>The punchline here is the industry is back. We are back as a company. The industry is back. We are above where we were at the high watermark pre COVID. And if you look at that January statistic, January was particularly strong with a really strong performance. And that's just not Omicron overlap [virus] versus 2019, January was a very strong month.</p><p>So a little bit about who we are as a company. I like this chart a lot. It shows the 10 segments of business that we operate within. As I mentioned before, we are fully diversified. We are the backbone of the food away-from-home channel. We are #1 in 8 out of the 10 segments that are on this chart. And for the 2 that we're not #1, we have a strong position.</p><p>More importantly than that, 66% of our business is restaurants, but our ability to grow profitably not just in the restaurant business but across the food away from home sector is robust and strong. Even in the sectors where we are #1, we still have enormous headroom still to go. And what I love about this chart is the diversification and the type of different business sectors that we serve from the government all the way to single mom-and-pop operated restaurants.</p><p>Many of you know us, Sysco, as a broad line distributor, a broad line range of products delivered on a tri-temperature truck, in a timely manner, filled in full. What you may not know as much is that we are the leader in what we call specialty foods. We own and operate the largest specialty produce business in the U.S. We own and operate the largest specialty center of plate business in the United States, and we have supplemented that over the last year through the acquisition of an Italian distributor platform called Greco, and I'm going to talk about that more in a minute.</p><p>Sysco purchases more local, fresh produce than anyone in the industry, 10 million cases of local produce purchased from over 500 local farms and that matters. It matters because the freshness that we're able to bring to our customers, and it matters because restaurants desire to be able to have produce that's been sourced locally on their menu. And we are working to expand our local and our fresh assortment.</p><p>Another key component of our growth and our profitability is Sysco brand. So we really appreciate and admire the companies on the left-hand side of this page, household names, foundation brands in our country and across the globe. On the right-hand side, you can see the quadri of Sysco brands. And on the top, if you look $18 billion of sales, $18 billion of sales coming from Sysco Brand. One brand alone, Sysco Classic, is over $5 billion per year. And it's more than 50% of the cases that get delivered to one of our local customers are from one of the Sysco brands that you see on the right-hand side.</p><p>And as I mentioned, the Greco acquisition that I described earlier, we were able to bring to our family Bellissimo and its family of products as well as Greco and its family of products to significantly improve our Italian offering. And you'll see those brands meaningfully grow over time.</p><p>The importance of this component is the Sysco brand case that gets put on that truck is meaningfully more profitable than a national brand case. And we have growth potential in Sysco brand even though we are already at 50-plus percent.</p><p>I'd like to talk a little bit about national sales. National sales is about 50% or CMU as we call it, contract bid business is about 50% of our business. It is a large and important component of what we do. The punchline is Sysco is winning meaningfully in national sales.</p><p>The why deserves a little bit of a discussion. Number one is the national reach and scale, the ability to go coast to coast. Many of these customers don't want to work with multiple distributor partners. They want to have one partner. They want to have deep integration with your technology tools. So there's frictionless ordering for their operators. They want reliability of on time and in full of a broad assortment. We, Sysco, can check all of those needs.</p><p>They want fulfillment strength. They want to never be out of stock, and they don't want for their restaurants ever to have to food -- not have a product and do a substitution on their menu coast to coast. We're winning meaningfully. They also want dedicated sales reps who are knowledgeable about them specifically and what their needs are, and we're checking each of those boxes in a meaningful way.</p><p>What is important is on the right-hand side of the page. We're meaningfully improving the profitability of national sales. How? further penetrating Sysco brand, working on introducing specialty. So perhaps they were buying frozen and dry from us for a long time. Now we're deeply penetrating in produce and protein. And those are higher margin, higher growth categories for us. And be working on each and every one of those contracts for margin optimization. We are pleased that year-to-date, we are ahead of both budget in volume and in margin rate from our contract bid business.</p><p>Let's talk about our total business across the entire enterprise. As Andrew said, 3 years ago, we stood up on stage and talked about Sysco being the biggest in the industry and the, by far most profitable in the industry from an EBITDA as a percentage of sales perspective, but we wanted and needed to become a growth company. The best companies in the world are growth companies in the industries with which they compete within. And this chart does all the talking that I needed to do. We are meaningfully outperforming the industry in total and have been doing so now for meaningful consecutive quarters. We are pulling away from the pack.</p><p>And I'd like to talk with you about how and why. The how and why is what this chart shows, which we call internally the Recipe for Growth. Yes, it's a play on words. It's in our nod towards food, but it literally is, our recipe for how we will drive growth.</p><p>It starts with our purpose, which is at the top of the page, connecting the world to share food and care for one another. Those words, carefully chosen, motivate our employees. They motivated us to go the extra mile, to help a supplier, to help a customer, to do more than those we compete against to provide what our customers and our colleagues need to be successful.</p><p>Importantly, it's a growth wheel. Each of the 5 elements, which I'm going to walk you through today feed each other. They work in concert with each other. And it's the aggregate of all of them working together that creates differentiation from those that we compete against, which is allowing us to win share.</p><p>So I have a video I'd like to show that does a better job than I can have, explaining this through the eyes of what our customers see. You could roll the video, please.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KEVIN P. HOURICAN: Okay. Great. What I love about that video is it brings forth the ethos of who we are as people, what we are as a company and what we're doing to better serve our customers. From experts in food to experts in supply chain to going the extra mile by having a later in the evening order cutoff and doing what's necessary to earn every last case from every customer we serve, in aggregate, that's the Recipe for Growth.</p><p>I'd like to take a quick turn through each of the 5 pillars, highlighting 1 or 2 things from each of them that can help you understand the full spectrum of the story that we are building at Sysco and why it's winning in the marketplace.</p><p>The first is digital. And the reason we started here is our digital tools, going back 3 years ago, did not meet our expectations for how we wanted to serve our customers. And we have made remarkable progress across the past 3 years. Our goal here is to improve the purchase experience, remove friction, make it easier for our customers to do business with Sysco, inspire them to buy more products from us and, most importantly, personalize their experience because our website is a 1:1, B2B website. It can be customized for each and every customer we serve.</p><p>The e-mails they receive from us are customized to the type of cuisine they buy. The pricing they see on our website and in those promotional e-mails is unique to them, understanding the elasticity of that item for them. As I said, we made substantial progress in digital over the past few years.</p><p>The second is products and solutions. We're in the food business. Tonight, we'll be able to enjoy many of our best products. We wouldn't be who we are without having the broadest assortment in the industry. The improvements that we've made over the last year was we put tremendous effort, especially in the face of stiff inflation, to improve our partnership with our suppliers through what we call strategic sourcing, to create value to be able to pass that value on to our customers. No one in the industry that we compete within should be able to buy food at a better cost than Sysco.</p><p>Second is advancing Sysco brands. We're making meaningful progress in the penetration of Sysco brand cases. Why is it important? Retention of that customer is higher. Profitability is the case of the higher. And their trust in Sysco goes up, more Sysco products they make.</p><p>One of the things I'm most proud of is the next sector down, which is the growth in cuisine segments. The purchase of Greco Foods and the expansion of that platform across the country, we have doubled our Italian share in the last 18 months, doubled our Italian share.</p><p>So I'd like to go on to supply chain. This is a core strength of our company. As I mentioned, we have more distribution nodes than anyone we compete with across the globe. We are closer to that end customer than anyone. But we're not satisfied with where we are. We are innovating our supply chain to allow us to efficiently have a late in the evening order cutoff deliver 6-plus days per week and to do so in a more flexible manner to meet our customers where they are. We recently launched our first what we call omnichannel pilot, which is to separate the front end from the back end of our supply chain. So let the customer be delivered from the closest distribution center to where that restaurant is but stock the inventory where we find it to be most optimal.</p><p>So essentially, cross-stocking merge-in-transit is what we now have. It will lower transportation costs. It will increase product availability to our customers and it will lower our networking inventory capital investment. It's a win-win-win.</p><p>This is a relationships business. I hope you saw that in the video, Neil's got a great video that he's going to show that's going to bring to life even more. This is a relationships business. 7,500 salespeople strong. We are increasing the penetration of what we call specialists. So that's in produce. That's in center of plate, and that's in Italian. We are investing to grow each of those 3 sales force presences and then combining them with what we call the generalist who owns the accounts to do team-based selling. And we have a team that sits above those professionals that essentially is the quarterback that allocates that talent to the right restaurant, at the right time, with the right skill set.</p><p>Imagine a customer that's been buying from us from Broadline from years and has not brought producer specialty protein. Our ability to have a targeted visit with a targeted reason to buy from Sysco today is what we are doing better than ever at Sysco, and it's paying big dividends.</p><p>Last but not least, on the 5 Recipe for Growth tours around the wheel is what we call future horizons. And it's a combination of 3 things. First and foremost, it's structural cost out. It's about being relentless, relentless, relentless at taking out cost to invest into growth.</p><p>Number two is tuck-in M&amp;A to help grow our ability to better serve our customers or expand into adjacent businesses or expand into white spaces from a geography perspective. We've done good work over the last few years in acquisitions, and there's plenty of great work still in front of us with Joel Grade, leading the charge, running business development for Sysco.</p><p>And last but not least is sustainability. And Neil is going to talk a lot about sustainability when he comes up, so I'm not going to steal any of his thunder, but we are proud to be the first in our industry to make a science-based commitment goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and we're pleased and proud to be doing that work.</p><p>So this is my last slide. And as I go to wrap up, my key message here is it's only at Sysco can you expect all of these 5 things coming together, working in concert to create the differentiation because it is differentiation that creates a durable, sustainable competitive advantage, and that is what we are building at Sysco.</p><p>We're already the largest and by far most profitable on an [EBIT] percent of sales. And when you combine growth orientation on top of that bedrock foundation of financial strength, we have the opportunity to pull away and gain even more share in a highly fragmented $350 billion business. We have the opportunity to continue to expand our assortment. I mentioned our expansion into more local fresh. We talked about being right on price, using best-in-class technology to provide each customer item-specific pricing. We're talking about taking our supply chain already a robust strength for the company and increasing the number of distribution nodes we have, which Neil will talk about but more importantly meeting the customer where they are. What they've told us is they want a later in the evening order cutoff.</p><p>Think about on how basic that is. If the evening was busier than they expected, and they run out of salmon, they want to know that Sysco has their back and that we're going to be there tomorrow morning to bring them fresh fish to keep their business running. We're going to talk about that in detail as time goes on, but the best proof point of that project is what we call Sysco Your Way. And Sysco Your Way is a program that we rolled out this past year, and it is creating a step change level of customer service to our customers.</p><p>Late in the evening order cut off, 6-plus day per week delivery, dedicated driver, dedicated sales partner. We are posting double-digit increases in top line and bottom line growth in the Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, and we have launched more than 300 of those neighborhoods since the pilot began a little over a year ago.</p><p>The second example is a program that we have called Sysco Perks. Sysco Perks is for a customer that is outside of a Sysco Your Way neighborhood but they have a profit profile that is rich to us. It's a VIP invitation-only loyalty program, loyalty club. We launched it in the fourth quarter of last year, and we have enrolled more than 10,000 customers in Sysco Your Way in less than 90 days.</p><p>Why? Because it meets exactly the needs that they have, and we are extremely pleased with the lift that we are posting in top line and bottom line with the customers that we have enrolled. And for every other customer that we serve it's about being right on price, having the broadest assortment, having a relationship with them and being there for them by delivering on time and in full. And we are pleased and proud of the progress that we're making that we have become a growth company.</p><p>And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil, our interim CFO, who is doing an outstanding job and my partner in helping run the company.</p><p>So Neil, come on up.</p><p>NEIL A. RUSSELL, INTERIM CFO, SENIOR VP OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS &amp; CHIEF COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER, SYSCO CORPORATION: Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate that. To all of you listening to us on the webcast, either live or on a recorded basis, thanks for joining us. Glad to have you. And for those of you in the room, it sure is great to be back live at CAGNY here with you today.</p><p>And I know if you're in the room, what you're thinking, wait, are those 2 speakers different heights? The answer to that is, yes. So I'm actually stalling for a minute here to give Mark and team sometime in the back to lower their camera. So are we good? Okay. Let's go ahead and dive into some financial information here.</p><p>I'm going to do my presentation in 2 parts. Let me talk to you about the first half of the fiscal year for us. For those of you that don't know us that well, we're a fiscal year company. So when I say first half, I'm talking about the 6 months that ended December.</p><p>And then as Kevin said, I'll spend the second part of my presentation talking to you about sustainability and DEI at Sysco and why that is so important to our long-term future and growth.</p><p>Starting with the financials and looking at the slide that's in front of you. We had a tremendous first half of the year. Sales growth was more than 15% for the first 6 months compared to the prior year, and volumes in the U.S. for us grew 6.3%, and local volume increased 4.3% for us. Very healthy top line, very healthy volume growth for us throughout the first half of the year that we're very proud of. That led to gross profit dollar growth. That was very strong for us for the first 6 months of the year as well.</p><p>Gross profit dollars grew nearly 17%, and gross margin as a percentage of sales gained 24 basis points despite relatively high inflation growing to nearly 18% or a little more than 18%. Inflation did moderate as we went through the first 6 months of the year, but it's still fairly high single digits for us. And we would expect that to continue to moderate just a little bit further as we work through the end of our fiscal year. We've done a very good job as a company, continuing to pass the inflation through both with the CMU type customers that Kevin talked about as well as those local independent customers. Our teams have done a very nice job managing inflation throughout the process.</p><p>That leads to very strong profit growth for us. So adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 15%, and earnings per share grew about 26% for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter for us was the most profitable second quarter we've ever had in the company's history, and that's going back 53 years. So the company is performing very well, and we've had tremendous profit growth.</p><p>Let's go ahead and talk a little bit about expenses and some of the drivers that are alluding to that strong profit growth. We've talked to you about 3 different key expenses we've had in the business, snap-back costs, which were generally cost related to the great resignation and the recruitment and staffing of the operation like we, and many other companies have faced. I want you to think about sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, recruitment fees, advertising fees, marketing fees to get jobs back into the business. That is what we call snap-back costs.</p><p>We've also had productivity costs as part of the business because think about the large wave of new colleagues we have in the business and their relative productivity compared to the average tenure associate and what that means in terms of cost for our business. And we also have what we call transformation costs, purposeful investments into the long-term growth of the business.</p><p>You can see on the chart here that, across the last couple of quarters, we've had more than $60 million decrease in those expenses. In fact, those snap-back costs that I mentioned, they're now eliminated in the business. So we've worked through that process. The productivity costs, as you can see, are now about half of what they've used to be. So the productivity is increasing throughout the operation, and we feel very good about the trajectory there.</p><p>You can see a small decrease in the transformation cost, and that's planned and purposeful as part of our trajectory. But we will always have some amount of those transformation costs because, as Kevin just walked you through that Recipe for Growth, we're going to continue to invest in the long-term health of our business, and these costs are coming down in the right trajectory that we'd like to see for the long-term health. So we're very pleased with what we see across these 3 specific costs.</p><p>But while we're on the topic of cost, let's talk about what we call cost-out across the business. So now I want to pivot to more of a structural cost conversation. And different from those 3 categories I just spoke to you of, structural costs that we've taken out of the business have now totaled more than $750 million across the business.</p><p>So what kind of costs are structural costs that we've taken out? I want you to think of things like administrative staffing positions, back office type support functions where we've gotten better at automation using AI and other things to permanently take staff out of the operation and reduce our costs even lower. I want you to think about things like supply chain efficiencies that we've improved on, invested in, digital technologies that we've invested in that are driving costs lower on a permanent basis.</p><p>And we've also done things that we call regionalization across our U.S. business and across Canada, where we've taken groups of sites and put a group management team over instead of a singular management team. And that's been very successful for us. Not only it's helped us reduce cost, it's helped us improve the flow of decision-making and the accuracy in which we're handling the operation. Those are examples of things that we mean when we say structural cost-out. And we've delivered this goal earlier than planned, and the team has done a really nice job managing these costs for us.</p><p>And what are we using this to do? We're using this to fund our future. So when you hear us talk about the Recipe for Growth, the supply chain transformation, the digital technologies, things like Sysco Your Way that Kevin just described, we are funding all of that work through these type of structural cost-out, which is not only allowing for near term but long term profitable growth for us. So very pleased with the numbers that we have here, the pace in which we've done it and any guidance we provide to you, all of this is included within the guidance. We are funding our long-term growth. It's part of our guidance, and we're very pleased with the trajectory that we have here.</p><p>So what does that mean in terms of profitability for the business? This is a chart that we're very proud of because we'd love to show EPS charts that have a trajectory up and to the right, and that's what you see here. Now we offered guidance at our last earnings call just a few weeks ago, and that's what you see on the far right here is an annualized number and the guidance we gave. We gave a range for earnings per share for this fiscal year of $4 to $4.15 per share. And so let's call it the midpoint that you see here on the $4.07, and we're here today to tell you that we remain on track for that, and we feel good about the trajectory of the guidance for this year.</p><p>And you can see how that compares to the prior year is obviously the dip related to COVID. But looking back over time and comparing to the prior year, 25% earnings per share growth, and that number will also represent 15% earnings per share growth compared to the all-time high that Sysco had in 2019. So this is going to be a very strong year for Sysco, tremendous growth, not only compared to prior year, but compared to all-time high with the earnings per share.</p><p>So what do we do with that earnings that we generate as a business? We have a very balanced approach to capital allocation and the priorities in which we speak to. And so let me talk about each of these, and I'll give you some examples of a couple of these as well.</p><p>First and foremost, as you can tell based upon the comments Kevin and I are giving you today, we are investing in the business. We are investing in long-term growth. Think about our fleet, think about our facilities, think about the technology that's needed to continue to advance the business and growing over time. That is the first priority for us.</p><p>And included in investing in the business are things like what we call the smaller tuck-in acquisitions. And as commented, in our industry, we have a full pipeline of good opportunities. Kevin mentioned Joel Grade, who's running that part of the business for us. He's doing a fantastic job with different types of specialty companies, smaller Broadline companies, different geographies that make sense for us. So investing in the fleet, the facilities, the technology and the smaller tuck-in type acquisitions is the first priority to grow the business for the long term.</p><p>Second is to maintain that strong balance sheet. We have a targeted leverage ratio range net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 to 2.75x. And we ended in that second quarter at right at 3x. So we've taken debt down meaningfully over the last couple of years and are very much on a path and trajectory to fall within what we feel is that very appropriate and good range for our balance sheet.</p><p>And speaking of debt, and on that debt side, we have a lot of confidence and feel very good about where we are because 95% of our debt is of that fixed nature. So even though we're reducing debt and reducing that risk on the balance sheet and bringing that down to this really good range, what debt we do have is of the fixed rate variety, so we feel good about that.</p><p>Third, and importantly, is our ability to return value to shareholders. And as we think about this, we think about it really in 2 forms, the dividend, which I'll speak of and also share repurchases, which, as you know, for this year, we committed to up to $500 million worth of share repurchases for this fiscal year, and I'm proud to announce today that we're actually active back in the market, working our way towards that goal. So we're actively buying back our shares as I speak to you right now.</p><p>Looking at that first priority of investing in the business, also glad to announce today that we actually have 7 new buildings underway for us to expand Sysco. And that's across the business segments and portfolio that we have that you can see on the bottom of the slide. Those are Broadline facilities. Those are SYGMA facilities. It's Greco facilities, some of our specialty meat companies and even our business in Sweden. And then, of course, because of that, you can see it's across geographies. Across the United States, we have different locations where you see those Sysco labels. And Sweden and then Ireland, all new buildings going into place for us as we speak. And in addition; to the 7 new buildings, we also have expansion underway in several other facilities.</p><p>This is growth that's concentrated really in high potential markets and cuisine segments that we feel very good about. We've analyzed specifically where to put these new buildings, and they're going to help us reduce costs. We're going to reduce our cost to serve. We're going to reduce our stretch miles, and we're going to get better at how we're operating. And so we're bringing down costs, we're bringing up the opportunity to serve our customers more with these types of expansions.</p><p>But we're prioritizing these investments. This doesn't particularly mean a large increase in capital spending. We're falling within the ratios that we've set and that we've guided you towards over time. So this is not incremental increase. It's prioritization of the choices for the right long-term growth for Sysco.</p><p>As we think about that return to shareholders, and as I said, it's a balance between the dividend and the share repurchases, you can see another nice up and to the right chart here with over time, the amount of value that we've returned to shareholders. So over the last 9 years, over $14 billion returned to shareholders through both of those forms of share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to the share repurchases I've said, and the dividend is a priority not only to pay, but to increase over time with the Board.</p><p>Speaking of dividends, Sysco is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats, and that's a pretty exclusive club. To be a member of this club, you have to increase your dividend for 25 consecutive years. Now Sysco has actually more than doubled that. We've been increasing our dividend for 53 years. And to increase your dividend more than 50 years, there's only 8 consumer stocks that can say that. And there's only another 4 that are actually here at CAGNY this week. So very proud of our commitment to return value to our shareholders through the dividend and its increase, and we're proud to be a member of the Dividend Aristocrats.</p><p>The commonality across these companies is you need to have a very resilient business model, which is what we have. And you also need to be able to generate a lot of cash in order to make that type of commitment, and we also have that. So it's a fantastic opportunity for Sysco to have such a strong, resilient business model that generates as much cash as we do and to be able to share that return with you along the way and to have the commitment to continued increases as we do that.</p><p>Why is that important? I'm sure, as you know, if you were to look at the grouping of companies that are the Dividend Aristocrats and compare that to the performance of the overall market, the Dividend Aristocrats performed more than 700 basis points better than the overall market in just the last year alone. So again, a very exclusive club to be part of and something that we're very, very proud of.</p><p>Now let me pause for a minute here and change gears and talk about sustainability. And why do we spend so much time talking about sustainability at Sysco? Well simply put, and I could just stop after saying the following sentence, it's the right thing to do. But we take that further. It actually is obviously very important to all of us and important to where we go from here because we know that environmental, social and governance issues are important to the long-term health of your company and the ability to continue to grow. So not only is it the right thing to do, it's good for business. That's why we're committed to it, and that's why we spend so much time on it.</p><p>Now like Kevin did, for me, there's going to be a video that I'm going to show you that, that can do a better job describing how this plays out in our business than I can. So let me set this up for you a little bit.</p><p>I want to introduce you to Marty. Marty is a sales consultant of Sysco. She works up in Oregon. And she's so good at supporting her customers that one of her customer locations, the owners wrote her a letter to thank her for their support.</p><p>And I want to introduce you to Dimple and Sumesh, immigrants who had a dream to come to America, open a restaurant and live their dream of sharing their food and their passion for cooking with others. No sooner did they open their restaurants, then the next day in Oregon, a forest fire ravaged the town. All around them was destruction. You can stand on the front porch of their restaurant called Gather and see nothing but destruction. But somehow, some way, their facility survived.</p><p>And they relied on Marty to help them figure out where do they go from here, what tools does Sysco have? What product does Sysco have? How can we help them in such a time of stress that they never would have imagined would be part of their portfolio and how can they help their community? That's why that purpose that Kevin spoke of is so, so important to us.</p><p>We are going to drive the business. I'll take you back to the line chart that Kevin showed you and showed Sysco growing at a certain pace and a gap to the market. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to outpace the market with our growth, but we're going to do it the right way, thinking about the long-term health of the enterprise and the future generations that are going to follow us, and I think this video does a nice job showing that to you.</p><p>Mark, let's queue the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>NEIL A. RUSSELL: We never imagined a company as big as Sysco could treat us like the family we've become. That's why we do that work the way we do. So as we think about sustainability, there are 3 primary pillars we think about and categorize the work: People; products; and planet. And we have categories of work within each of those pillars, and there's a lot of details within it.</p><p>This work is important to our customers, of course, as you just saw. It's important to our colleagues. There's not an interview I have with someone joining the organization that doesn't say to me, \"I read your sustainability report, and I have a question about this.\" It's important to our communities, of course, and it's important to our planet. If we want to continue to source the produce that we're sourcing, there is no Planet B. There's no other choice. We have to do this work. And at Sysco, there's one table, and everyone has a seat at Sysco's table, which is why I'm proud to announce today our new sustainability platform and our north star of how we think about our work going forward for the next generations to follow us, and that's one planet, one table. And that's a north star in which how we're going to think and make decisions going forward.</p><p>Sysco sits in the middle of the supply chain. And so transitioning a bit to the importance of the business aspect of this work, we have customers who have set their own goals to make progress in this area. They need a distributor partner, a supplier who has also signed up for those goals and can help them advance their own business. We have supplier partners that have set their own goals and want to grow. They need to grow with a customer who is also set their own goals to help them. And that's how it's going to work across the supply chain. You're either in or you're out. And the long-term growth is if you're in. And that's a tremendous opportunity. And we're happy to take that leadership position. For others that will follow in our footsteps, we're glad to have them join us on the journey to make everything better for all of us.</p><p>A few examples of some of the work that we've done. We've partnered with Cargill on some fantastic work in the Southern Grasslands in the United States and 10 ranchers who are moving their herds around and actually reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the work that they're doing relative to that. We have solar facilities going in place across our enterprise. There is one on the example screen here in the GB for us, and we have Canada and United States facilities underway.</p><p>And think of the really cool future for us where our electric trucks, which we have an LOI for more than 800 of them out there right now, to be charged by solar on our roofs. And really cool at dinner tonight in addition to the awesome food you're going to have and the fantastic chefs and the interaction you're going to have, that electric truck is here with us tonight, and it's parked outside, and you're going to get a chance to see it. And so we're excited to be able to share that with you.</p><p>What I'm most proud of is what's on the far right, and that's how we set our goals. You can see it by 2030. We could have chosen 2050. We could have chosen 2040, but we chose 2030 because it's going to be this management team that's going to make it happen. It's not a hope and wish. And it's not a problem for the next management team to solve for. It's this team that's going to get it done.</p><p>DEI is also extremely important to us. We want a workplace where our differences are valued and celebrated, and we're creating that inclusive culture. Our customers need to see themselves in our products, in our colleagues and in the way in which we operate. Again, everyone has a seat at our table, and we're holding ourselves accountable to this. We're setting goals and we're publishing updates against that. We published our first ever DEI report. It's available on the website, and I encourage you to go see it. One small example is we had a gender and diversity goal set for 2025, and we've already achieved that goal. So now we're hard at work, setting what the next goal is going to be for us because, we need to make continuous progress in this area.</p><p>And speaking of diverse, I just want to spend a quick minute on our Board of Directors. This is a diverse, independent and experienced Board. The last 3 Directors we've added have added strong capabilities in each of these areas to us that are highlighted in blue on the chart. We have a 10-year policy for our Board, which is rare for public companies. And so our Board is relatively refreshed. Think about restaurant experience, consumer experience, retail experience, technology experience. We've got all of that on this fantastic board. It's a unique set of experiences and capabilities, and they give the management team challenges, good questions and full support, which is the way how it should be with a great Board of Directors.</p><p>So let me leave you with this. As we think about our investment thesis and going forward, we have tremendous growth opportunities across both the top and bottom line. We are a stronger company today than when we were here 3 years ago. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is working, as evidenced by the share gains we have relative to the rest of the industry. We are very much focused on the long-term growth opportunities across the business, and we're committed to returning that value to you with those strong shareholder returns that I mentioned. We've got a couple of minutes for questions.</p><p>So I'm going to turn it over to Kevin Kim to lead us through that.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KEVIN J. KIM, VP OF IR, SYSCO CORPORATION: Great. Let's go with the first question over here. Lauren? Let's wait for the mic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So you've gained a lot of market share over the last couple of years in an environment that's been relatively favorable for Sysco given your size and scale. You're looking to accelerate that market share now that the supply chain is normalizing broadly. Can you just talk about your confidence in being able to accelerate that market share given a relatively less favorable environment?</p><p>KEVIN P. HOURICAN: Lauren, thank you for the question. I think I'll start with the Recipe for Growth is cumulative building platform. We stated a couple of years ago what our goals were. We said we'd grow last year at 1.2x the industry. We posted a 1.3. We said this year, we'd grow at 1.35x the industry. We're on track to be able to do that. And we actually said next year, in the third year of the 3-year plan, we would grow at 1.5, and we're committed and confident in our ability to do that.</p><p>And the why, Lauren, the Recipe for Growth is still in the very early innings. People ask me all the time in a baseball game like what inning are you in. Kind of calibrated this morning, probably the third-ish, omnichannel hasn't even been rolled out nationwide. Sysco Your Way, kicking in. We just launched it in Dublin. We launched it in Toronto. We're about to launch it soon in Paris. We're about to launch it soon in Stockholm. Sysco Perks just rolled out in November.</p><p>The good news here specifically to the future growth. Each of these initiatives has been piloted. They've been tested, and we can see the very specific empirical outcomes. So these are not hypothesis-based projects. They are specific projects with proof points backed by data. And we're in rollout mode right now. So yes, our strength of supply chain over the past 18 months has contributed to market share gains. The Recipe for Growth is what's going to create the share gains into the future years, and we're confident in our ability to hit our targets. Thank you for asking.</p><p>KEVIN J. KIM: Okay. Let's go with one more question over there, Jeff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Great. Thank you very much. Just Kevin, because you were here 3 years ago and it was your pretty much first intro. Obviously, it's been an interesting 3 years. I'm just wondering if you could maybe briefly compare and contrast your outlook for the business today versus 3 years ago. And what do you think is the greatest hurdle you're going to face over the next 12 to 18 months in terms of the greatest headwind? Obviously, you faced plenty of headwinds over the past 3, what are you anticipating the biggest headwinds for the next 12?</p><p>KEVIN P. HOURICAN: Jeff, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start, I'll toss to Neil to see if he has things to add. I said on stage here 3 years ago, why I joined the company, and that was my excitement to be in this industry. Food is a great space to be in. Supply chain is my passion and my work and in my career. And we are a growth company and a very large business with \"only 17% share.\" 3 years later, Jeff, I'm even more excited than the day I arrived.</p><p>There is so much growth potential. We haven't talked a lot today about international. International is contributing meaningfully to us this year on a year-over-year profit growth and year-over-year sales growth perspective.</p><p>Our ability to profitably grow internationally is significant bolt-on acquisitions. Growth opportunity is significant. The work we've done with the Italian platform that we've doubled our market share in the past 18 months, and we're not even close to complete with that work yet. Largest, most profitable in our space with meaningful growth prospects and opportunities, and we're not even close to done, aka inning 3. And by the way, halfway through the game, we're going to come up with additional new growth ideas for the company.</p><p>So I'm even more confident than I was when I joined. It's a great company with great people, tremendous passion for our customers.</p><p>Neil, I'll toss to you for additional comments.</p><p>NEIL A. RUSSELL: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. So Jeff and actually, Lauren, I'll build on your question 2, 3 things real quick. One is that growth versus market. So when you hear us talk about that, Lauren, I heard your question about the macro. So it's relative to the market, right? So whatever you're going to see the market doing, our growth is going to exceed that. So the market's up, we'll be up even more, et cetera. So that growth versus the market is something that is important for us to measure and a key goal for us that, again, as Kevin said, we're on track for it.</p><p>Point two is that cost-out program that I mentioned. We've got work to do, so there's more to come in terms of our ability to take even additional costs out, and we feel good about the work that we're doing to identify those incremental opportunities. But as I said, that's helping to fund all of this work that we're doing. So we'll have a source of funding to be able to make those investments to advance the business going forward.</p><p>And then thirdly and importantly, our international business is performing really well. And I think that's part of the equation here to think of International has had tremendous year-over-year profit growth, and we're seeing the turn there with that performance. We're very pleased with where international is going for us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I think we'll wrap it up there.

Scores of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, although authorities have been unable yet to provide detailed figures.</p><p>Shifting winds and new flashpoints Friday afternoon caused the blazes outside Athens and Evia to repeatedly change direction, in some cases returning to threaten areas that had narrowly escaped destruction earlier this week.</p><p>After burning through forests and houses towards Lake Marathon, the capital\u2019s main water reservoir, a branch of the fire headed off into the Mount Parnitha national park \u2014 one of the last remaining substantial forests near Athens, which already bore deep scars from wildfires in 2007.</p><p>A 38-year-old volunteer firefighter died after a falling utility pole struck his head in an area north of Athens affected by the fire, officials said. At least 20 people have required treatment nationwide.</p><p>The causes of the fires are under investigation. Hardalias said three people were arrested Friday \u2014 in the greater Athens area, central and southern Greece \u2014 on suspicion of starting blazes, in two cases intentionally. Police said the suspect detained north of Athens had allegedly lit fires at three separate spots in the area ravaged by the large blaze, which first broke out Tuesday.</p><p>In the village of Limni on Evia, residents and vacationers were urged to hasten to the harbor and await embarkation after flames cut off all other means of escape. Two ferry boats picked up about 1,000 people, and one more would remain at Limni to take on later arrivals, the coast guard said.</p><p>Earlier in the day and late Thursday the coast guard evacuated nearly 700 people from other parts of the island, using patrol vessels, fishing boats and other private vessels.</p><p>\u201cWe're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,\u201d Sotiris Danikas, head of the coast guard in the town of Aidipsos on Evia, told state broadcaster ERT, describing the earlier sea evacuation.</p><p>A coast guard vessel also rescued 10 people trapped on a beach by another fire near the town of Gythio in the southern Peloponnese region.</p><p>President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed deep gratitude to all involved in the firefighting effort during a visit to the Fire Service headquarters Friday. She added: \u201cWe are all vulnerable to fire. There is much that needs to be done, both on a large and a small scale. But now we must display self-restraint and unity.\u201d</p><p>Greek and European officials have <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-environment-and-nature-climate-change-1ab13a82a8581f745aac18cab475e5d5\">blamed climate change</url> for the multiple fires burning through southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey.</p><p>In Italy, firefighters battling a wildfire in the province of Reggio Calabria found the bodies of a man and a woman in an olive grove.

Two firefighters were in intensive care in Athens, while another two were hospitalized with light burns.</p><p>More than 1,000 firefighters and nearly 20 aircraft are now battling major fires across Greece, while extra firefighters, planes, helicopters and vehicles were arriving from France, Switzerland, Romania, Cyprus, Croatia, Israel, Sweden and the U.S. Some 80 French and 40 Cypriot firefighters joined in efforts to fight the blazes north of Athens.</p><p>In Turkey, authorities on Friday evacuated six more neighborhoods near the Mugla province town of Milas as a wildfire fanned by winds burned some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from a power plant. Two other neighborhoods were also evacuated as a precaution later in the day, as another fire spread from the region of Yatagan, in Mugla, toward the edge of the neighboring province of Aydin, further north.</p><p>At least 36,000 people were evacuated to safety in Mugla province alone, officials said.</p><p>Excavators formed firebreaks to keep flames from the Yenikoy power plant, the second such facility to be threatened in the region.</p><p>Wildfires near the tourism resort of Marmaris, also in Mugla, were largely contained by late Thursday, while by Friday afternoon the two main fires in neighboring Antalya province were brought under control.</p><p>In Greece, the Athens fire halted traffic on the main highway connecting the capital to the north of the country and damaged electricity installations. The power distribution company announced rolling cuts in the wider capital region to protect the electrical grid.</p><p>In the Drosopigi area, resident Giorgos Hatzispiros surveyed the damage to his house Friday morning, the first time he was seeing it after being ordered to evacuate the previous afternoon. Only the charred walls of the single-story home remained, along with his children's bicycles, somehow unscathed in a storeroom. Inside, smoke rose from a still-smoldering bookcase.</p><p>\u201cNothing is left,\u201d Hatzispiros said.</p><p>In the southern Peloponnese region dozens of villages and settlements were evacuated, and a blaze was stopped before reaching monuments at Olympia, birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games.</p><p>The fires also disrupted COVID-19 vaccinations. The Health Ministry announced the suspension of vaccinations at centers in fire-affected areas.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address Thursday that the wildfires display \u201cthe reality of climate change.\u201d</p><p>In 2018, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire engulfed a seaside settlement east of Athens.</p><p>____</p><p>Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey, and Paphitis from Lemnos, Greece.

Still, many questions are circulating about <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089858\">why forest fires are becoming larger and more severe</url>-and what can be done about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is climate change fueling these fires? Does the long history of fighting every fire play a role? Should we leave more fires to burn? What can be done about Western forests' vulnerability to wildfires and climate change?</p><p>We invited 40 fire and forest ecologists living across the Western U.S. and Canada to examine the latest research and answer these questions in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/19395582/0/ja\">set of studies</url> published Aug. 2, 2021. Collectively, we are deeply concerned about the future of Western forests and communities under climate change.</p><p>So, why are wildfires getting worse?</p><p>Climate change is a big part of it. Summer wildfire seasons are <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8537\">already 40 to 80 days longer</url> on average than they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/313/5789/940.full.pdf\">30 years ago</url>. Annual <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607171113\">droughts are more pronounced</url>, making it easier for fuels to dry out and fires to ignite and spread. Extreme weather events, marked by dry fuels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259100\">lightning storms</url> and strong winds, are also <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091377\">increasingly common</url> and provide essential ingredients for rapid fire growth, as witnessed by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/climate/bootleg-wildfire-weather.html\">Bootleg Fire</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/wildfires/2021/07/we-need-to-be-prepared-for-anything-bootleg-fire-crews-wary-of-coming-heat-wave.html\">burning in Oregon</url> and record-setting fires in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/us/gigafire-california-august-complex-trnd/index.html\">California</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpr.org/2021/01/25/colorados-east-troublesome-wildfire-may-signal-a-new-era-of-big-fire-blow-ups/\">Colorado</url> in 2020.</p><p>Ironically, a chronic lack of fire in Western landscapes also contributes to increased fire severity and vulnerability to wildfires. It allows dry brush and live and dead trees to build up, and with more people living in wildland areas to spark blazes, pressure to fight every forest fire has increased the risk of extreme fire.</p><h>The problem with fighting every wildfire</h><p>Historically, fire was a regular visitor to most Western forests, except moist locations like those along the Pacific Northwest coast and in British Columbia. Frequent or periodic fires from Indigenous burning and lightning strikes created patchworks of grasslands, shrublands and regenerating forests of all ages.</p><p>Past fires influence the way subsequent fires burn and what they leave behind. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2020/10/06/what-the-forest-service-can-learn-from-indigenous-fire-management/\">Indigenous burning practices</url> not only enhance cultural resources and wildlife habitat but also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/california-wildfires-cultural-burns-indigenous-people\">reduce the amount and connectedness of fuels</url> that drive large, severe wildfires. Similarly, patchy burns from lightning ignitions create forest landscapes that are less likely to burn all at once.</p><p>The U.S. and Canada effectively suppress all but <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6254/1280.summary\">2%-3% of wildfire starts</url>. However, this small percentage of fires burn at the height of each fire season, when dry conditions and extreme fire weather thwart even the most aggressive attempts to suppress them.</p><p>[Photo: Library of Congress]<br/><br/>Unintentionally, by focusing on short-term risks of wildfires, the U.S. is predisposing forests to burn under the very worst conditions. Active fire suppression contributes to what is often referred to as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1315088111\">wildland fire paradox</url>-the more we prevent fires in the short term, the worse wildfires become when they return.</p><p>In one of the new studies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=phessburg\">Paul Hessburg</url> and co-authors explain how fire managers can mitigate the severity of future fires by managing fire-excluded forests to foster resilience to wildfires and drought. <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2432\">Management approaches</url> include thinning dense forests, reducing fuels through prescribed burning and managing wildfires to restore more typical patterns of forests, meadows, shrublands and woodlands.</p><p>In a second paper, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keala-Hagmann\">Keala Hagmann</url> and her co-authors describe how more than a century of fire exclusion and past forest management practices have <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2431\">jeopardized forest biodiversity and social and ecological values</url>, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5849/jof.2016-043R2\">culturally important resources</url>, the quantity and quality of water, stability of carbon stores, recreation and air quality.</p><p>For example, fire exclusion has compromised aspen stands-<url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/defaults/s7526c88h\">biodiversity hot spots</url> for everything from bears to butterflies. Increased forest cover diverts water from downslope meadows, allowing conifer forests to further encroach on aspen habitat.</p><h>A path forward</h><p>Amid the daunting reality of climate change and severe wildfires, there is a path forward for Western forests.</p><p>In a third article, <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wW8Y_TkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Susan Prichard</url> and her co-authors examine which <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2433\">adaptive forest management approaches</url> have worked to increase resilience to wildfires and climate change. There is strong scientific evidence that fuel reduction treatments-including forest thinning, prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning and managed wildfires-are effective approaches for mitigating future fire impacts to Western forests. However, land managers can't expect these treatments to work if they are applied to only a small fraction of Western forest landscapes.</p><p>When combined, forest thinning and prescribed burning in dry ponderosa pine and in dry and moist mixed-conifer forests have been shown to be highly effective at reducing the fire damage to forests. However, this type of treatment is not appropriate for all forest types. Fire managers in some wilderness areas and national parks have allowed fires started by lightning to burn in some wind and weather conditions. Over the past 40-plus years, these wildfires have been allowed to burn and reburn landscapes, generally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24700425\">limiting the size and severity of subsequent wildfires</url>.</p><p>Given the immense diversity of Western forests, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, in forests that historically supported more frequent fire, revitalizing and continuing cultural burning practices, prescribed burning, and forest thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce overcrowding and the potential for severe fires. Thinning and prescribed burning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/research/highlights/highlights_display.php?in_high_id=1385\">aren't appropriate or feasible</url> everywhere. In reality, only a portion of landscapes can be treated this way. Allowing wildfires to burn in more areas under moderate weather conditions is also part of the solution.</p><p>Promoting resilient Western forests will require that our society builds a new relationship with fire by creating fire-adapted communities and looking for opportunities to restore fire to Western forest landscapes.</p><p>In this era of warmer, drier summers and longer fire seasons, there are no fire- or smoke-free solutions. The current approach to fire management poses unnecessarily high stakes for Western forests. There is no doubt that the future of Western forests is a fiery one. How we choose to live with fire is still up to us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Susan J.

Scores of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, although authorities have been unable yet to provide detailed figures.</p><p>Shifting winds and new flashpoints Friday afternoon caused the blazes outside Athens and Evia to repeatedly change direction, in some cases returning to threaten areas that had narrowly escaped destruction earlier this week.</p><p>After burning through forests and houses towards Lake Marathon, the capital\u2019s main water reservoir, a branch of the fire headed off into the Mount Parnitha national park \u2014 one of the last remaining substantial forests near Athens, which already bore deep scars from wildfires in 2007.</p><p>A 38-year-old volunteer firefighter died after a falling utility pole struck his head in an area north of Athens affected by the fire, officials said. At least 20 people have required treatment nationwide.</p><p>The causes of the fires are under investigation. Hardalias said three people were arrested Friday \u2014 in the greater Athens area, central and southern Greece \u2014 on suspicion of starting blazes, in two cases intentionally. Police said the suspect detained north of Athens had allegedly lit fires at three separate spots in the area ravaged by the large blaze, which first broke out Tuesday.</p><p>In the village of Limni on Evia, residents and vacationers were urged to hasten to the harbor and await embarkation after flames cut off all other means of escape. Two ferry boats picked up about 1,000 people, and one more would remain at Limni to take on later arrivals, the coast guard said.</p><p>Earlier in the day and late Thursday the coast guard evacuated nearly 700 people from other parts of the island, using patrol vessels, fishing boats and other private vessels.</p><p>\u201cWe're talking about the apocalypse, I don't know how to describe it,\u201d Sotiris Danikas, head of the coast guard in the town of Aidipsos on Evia, told state broadcaster ERT, describing the earlier sea evacuation.</p><p>A coast guard vessel also rescued 10 people trapped on a beach by another fire near the town of Gythio in the southern Peloponnese region.</p><p>President Katerina Sakellaropoulou expressed deep gratitude to all involved in the firefighting effort during a visit to the Fire Service headquarters Friday. She added: \u201cWe are all vulnerable to fire. There is much that needs to be done, both on a large and a small scale. But now we must display self-restraint and unity.\u201d</p><p>Greek and European officials have <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-environment-and-nature-climate-change-1ab13a82a8581f745aac18cab475e5d5\">blamed climate change</url> for the multiple fires burning through southern Europe, from southern Italy to the Balkans, Greece and Turkey.</p><p>In Italy, firefighters battling a wildfire in the province of Reggio Calabria found the bodies of a man and a woman in an olive grove. LaPresse news agency said they died of smoke inhalation.</p><p>Massive fires have been burning across Siberia in Russia's north for weeks, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-environment-and-nature-climate-change-1ab13a82a8581f745aac18cab475e5d5\">hot, bone-dry, gusty weather</url> has also fueled <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/science-environment-and-nature-climate-change-1ab13a82a8581f745aac18cab475e5d5\">devastating wildfires in California</url>.</p><p>Greece has been baked by its most protracted heat wave in three decades, with temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), although it was cooler Friday.</p><p>At least 20 people have been treated for injuries from the fires. Two firefighters were in intensive care in Athens, while another two were hospitalized with light burns.</p><p>More than 1,000 firefighters and nearly 20 aircraft are now battling major fires across Greece, while extra firefighters, planes, helicopters and vehicles were arriving from France, Switzerland, Romania, Cyprus, Croatia, Israel, Sweden and the U.S. Some 80 French and 40 Cypriot firefighters joined in efforts to fight the blazes north of Athens.</p><p>In Turkey, authorities on Friday evacuated six more neighborhoods near the Mugla province town of Milas as a wildfire fanned by winds burned some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from a power plant. Two other neighborhoods were also evacuated as a precaution later in the day, as another fire spread from the region of Yatagan, in Mugla, toward the edge of the neighboring province of Aydin, further north.</p><p>At least 36,000 people were evacuated to safety in Mugla province alone, officials said.</p><p>Excavators formed firebreaks to keep flames from the Yenikoy power plant, the second such facility to be threatened in the region.</p><p>Wildfires near the tourism resort of Marmaris, also in Mugla, were largely contained by late Thursday, while by Friday afternoon the two main fires in neighboring Antalya province were brought under control.</p><p>In Greece, the Athens fire halted traffic on the main highway connecting the capital to the north of the country and damaged electricity installations. The power distribution company announced rolling cuts in the wider capital region to protect the electrical grid.</p><p>In the Drosopigi area, resident Giorgos Hatzispiros surveyed the damage to his house Friday morning, the first time he was seeing it after being ordered to evacuate the previous afternoon. Only the charred walls of the single-story home remained, along with his children's bicycles, somehow unscathed in a storeroom. Inside, smoke rose from a still-smoldering bookcase.</p><p>\u201cNothing is left,\u201d Hatzispiros said.</p><p>In the southern Peloponnese region dozens of villages and settlements were evacuated, and a blaze was stopped before reaching monuments at Olympia, birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games.</p><p>The fires also disrupted COVID-19 vaccinations. The Health Ministry announced the suspension of vaccinations at centers in fire-affected areas.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address Thursday that the wildfires display \u201cthe reality of climate change.\u201d</p><p>In 2018, more than 100 people died when a fast-moving forest fire engulfed a seaside settlement east of Athens.</p><p>____</p><p>Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey, and Paphitis from Lemnos, Greece.

The decision Tuesday halts for the second time a 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest that includes commercial timber sales, work to improve fish passage, prescribed burning, the closing of some roads and restoration of Ponderosa pine ecosystems. The Lost Creek-Boulder Creek Landscape Restoration Project had previously gone before the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals in 2018, where the Forest Service lost. The Forest Service in 2019 renewed the project with a new approval decision based on a clarified environmental review, which went through a public comment period. </p><p>The Forest Service said that decision was entirely new and removed the process from the 9th Circuit ruling. But a U.S. District Court disagreed, ruling the latest plan contains the same environmental law violations the appeals court cited. The Forest Service is required by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 to develop plans for its national forests. The Payette National Forest plan was developed in 2003. The Forest Service with the Lost Creek-Boulder Creek project sought to sidestep a part of that plan by reclassifying portions of the forest from timber harvest to landscape restoration with a goal of growing larger trees. The Forest Service could avoid violating its forest plan if needed by cutting down large trees in those reclassified areas. Judge B. Lynn Winmill of the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, in ruling against the Forest Service, wrote that if violating the forest plan \"could be justified by explaining that a later project -- such as cutting down the overabundance of large trees -- would cure the violation, the 2003 Forest Plan could be ignored and [National Forest Management Act] rendered a null Act.\" The Forest Service said it doesn't comment on litigation. The Justice Department, which defends federal agencies in lawsuits, didn't respond yesterday to an inquiry from the Associated Press. \"The [Forest Service] thought it could get away with more logging by simply claiming logging isn't logging -- it's 'restoration,'\" said Michael Garrity of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, one of the three groups that brought the lawsuit. \"But to do this, they had to violate the forest plan.\" The Forest Service had support for the project from the Payette Forest Coalition, which offered recommendations on the project. The coalition contains environmental groups, notably the Idaho Conservation League, as well as timber companies and local government entities. The project included such things as improving fish passage for bull trout, a federally protected species. Another key draw for environmental groups supporting the project was changing portions of the forest from a timber harvest designation to a restoration designation. Specifically, the Forest Service wanted to restore native stands of Ponderosa pine, a fire-reliant and fire-resistant species that needs an occasional forest fire to open its pine cones with intense heat and destroy competing trees. The project would have removed Douglas fir and grand fir trees from what had once been Ponderosa pine strongholds in the forest. Ponderosa pine shed their lowest limbs to get out of the reach of wildfires, and their bark is thick and able to resist flames. But the trees can die in wildfires when surrounded by Douglas fir and grand fir, which typically have branches much closer to the ground and lack the fire resistance of Ponderosas. The Payette National Forest has a handful of other restoration projects in the works that are in various stages of just beginning or nearing completion. -- Keith Ridler, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T9-8V91-DY7N-F00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Forest Service said that decision was entirely new and removed the process from the 9th Circuit Court ruling.</p><p>But a U.S. District Court disagreed, ruling the latest plan contains the same environmental law violations the appeals court cited.</p><p>The Forest Service is required by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 to develop plans for its national forests. The Payette National Forest plan was developed in 2003.</p><p>The Forest Service with the Lost Creek-Boulder Creek project sought to sidestep a part of that plan by reclassifying portions of the forest from timber harvest to landscape restoration with a goal of growing larger trees. The Forest Service could avoid violating its forest plan if needed by cutting down large trees in those reclassified areas.</p><p>U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill in ruling against the Forest Service wrote that if violating the forest plan \u201ccould be justified by explaining that a later project \u2013 such as cutting down the overabundance of large trees \u2013 would cure the violation, the 2003 Forest Plan could be ignored and (National Forest Management Act) rendered a null Act.\u201d</p><p>The Forest Service said it doesn't comment on litigation. The Justice Department, which defends federal agencies in lawsuits, didn't respond Wednesday to an inquiry from The Associated Press sent through a media request form on its website.</p><p>\u201cThe (Forest Service) thought it could get away with more logging by simply claiming logging isn\u2019t logging \u2013 it\u2019s \u201crestoration,\u201d said Michael Garrity of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, one of the three groups who brought the lawsuit. \u201cBut to do this, they had to violate the Forest Plan.\u201d</p><p>The Forest Service had support for the project from the Payette Forest Coalition, which offered recommendations on the project. The coalition contains environmental groups, notably the Idaho Conservation League, as well as timber companies and local government entities. The project included such things as improving fish passage for bull trout, a federally protected species.</p><p>Another key draw for environmental groups supporting the project was changing portions of the forest from a timber harvest designation to a restoration designation.</p><p>Specifically, the Forest Service wanted to restore native stands of Ponderosa pine, a fire-reliant and fire-resistant species that needs an occasional forest fire to open its pine cones with intense heat and destroy competing trees.</p><p>The project would have removed Douglas fir and grand fir trees from what had once been Ponderosa pine strongholds in the forest. Ponderosa pine shed their lowest limbs to get out of the reach of wildfires, and their bark is thick and able to resist flames.</p><p>But the trees can die in wildfires when surrounded by Douglas fir and grand fir, which typically have branches much closer to the ground and lack the fire resistance of Ponderosas.</p><p>The Payette National Forest has a handful of other restoration projects in the works that are in various stages of just beginning or nearing completion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

So listeners are encouraged to read the Victoria's third quarter audited financial results report and the MD&amp;A both available on the company's website and on SEDAR.</p><p>Joining us on the call today are John McConnell, President and CEO, Marty Rendall, Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Ayranto, Chief Operating Officer. Please note that listeners and viewers will be muted, while management gives a short review of the results. And after the review, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Also note that this video call will be recorded and available on -- for playback on the Company's website.</p><p>We will be making forward-looking statements on this call and encourage all participants to see our disclosure documents including our corporate presentation, AIF and MD&amp;A and the cautionary notes therein, which can be found on SEDAR and the Company's website.</p><p>I will now turn the meeting over to John McConnell. Director, President and CEO.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. Lenora. Good morning, afternoon or evening everyone. I'll provide a brief summary of the quarter, then pass the call to Marty and Mark to provide more details. First and foremost, the Eagle Mine continued its strong safety record with no lost-time injuries again this quarter. At September 30th, our team had worked 2.7 million hours lost-time incident-free. Operationally, the third quarter of 2022 was a challenging one for the Eagle operation. Due to a combination of factors, including an unplanned shut down for localized forest fires in Yukon, early in the quarter and higher than expected unplanned maintenance downtime of our crusher and conveying circuit due to both supply chain and labor challenges we stacked less tonnes on the leach pad then we had planned in the quarter.</p><p>Despite the lower stacking rates in the third quarter, our gold production was within our expectations, and approximately 50,000 ounces. This production level was attributable to strong heap leach performance in the quarter. As recoveries continue to trend inline with our expectations. As previously announced in late September, the overland conveyor that delivers ore from the crushing plant to the heap leach facility at Eagle experienced a failure, this belt was replaced within our initially estimated timeframe and stacking operations resumed in the third week of October. As a result of the conveyor belt failure and subsequent repairs, we withdrew our production guidance for 2022, clearly not meeting our production guidance is disappointing to us and our investors. We will update the market on final 2022 production results in January.</p><p>We also look-forward to releasing an updated mine plan and Technical Report for Eagle, in the first quarter of 2023. On the exploration front, we achieved a major milestone in the quarter, releasing a maiden resource for the Raven discovery at the Dublin Gulch Project. We were pleased to report an initial 1.1 million ounce resource at an average grade of 1.7 grams per tonne, on only three field seasons and 18,000 meters of drilling. This discovery is located approximately 15 kilometers east of Eagle. We plan to update the maiden resource in the first-half of 2023 and look-forward to sharing with you the results of our 2022 exploration drilling at Raven in the coming months.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Marty Rendall, our Chief Financial Officer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, everyone. I will briefly discuss our financials, before passing it over to Mark to discuss operations. Currency will be in Canadian dollars, unless specifically mentioned otherwise. During the quarter, we produced about 50,000 ounces of gold and sold about 45,000 ounces, resulting in revenue of approximately CAD100 million. That is about 16% lower than a CAD120 million in revenue generated during the third quarter of 2021. The revenue difference is the result of reduced ounces sold. The gold price during the quarter in U.S. dollars was also lower than the previous year. However, this was predominantly, offset by a more favorable Canadian - U.S. dollar exchange rate. So in Canadian dollars, the gold price was similar to the previous year. Cost of goods sold was CAD65 million during the quarter, compared to CAD48 million in the third quarter of the previous year. The increase is due to inflation and working capital changes in inventory, specifically gold inventory.</p><p>The lower gold sales in revenue combined with higher costs year-over-year, certainly reduced profit margins. However, both gross profit at CAD16 million and operating earnings at CAD12 million remain positive. The strengthening U.S. dollar resulted in a foreign exchange loss on our U.S. denominated debt of CAD15 million for the quarter, contributing to a net loss of CAD9 million or CAD0.13 per share. At the end of September 2022, the company held cash and equivalents of CAD36 million, compared to CAD31 million at the end of December 2021. I'd like to remind listeners that we use our revolving credit facility to manage our Treasury, therefore, our cash balance generally stays fairly consistent while debt will fluctuate to match with liquidity needs.</p><p>Working capital at the end of September 2022 was CAD103 million compared to CAD63 million at the end of December 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher gold inventory, primarily on the heap leach pad. During the most recent quarter, total capital expenditures were CAD29 million. Well, nine months year-to-date total capital expenditures were CAD88 million. This is comprised of sustaining capital, capitalized stripping and growth capital and exploration. A detailed breakdown is shared within our MD&amp;A.</p><p>I'll now review our non-IFRS performance measures. Once again, the detailed numerical breakdown, along with commentary on the calculation of the non-IFRS measures can be found within our MD&amp;A. During this section. I will use U.S. dollars for unit-based numbers to allow for uniform comparison with our peers. The average realized price per ounce of gold sold during the most recent quarter with the $1,717. This compares with the third quarter of 2021, where the average realized price was $1,806 per ounce. Cash cost per ounce of gold sold during the most recent quarter was $1,116, compared to the third quarter of '21 were cash costs were $780 per ounce. All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold, during the most recent quarter were $1,489. This compares to the third quarter of '21, where all-in sustaining costs were $961 per ounce.</p><p>Free-cash flow, during the most recent quarter was negative CAD9 million. This compares to the third quarter of '21, where free-cash flow was positive CAD32 million. EBITDA or earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization, during the most recent quarter was positive CAD21 million, this compares to the third quarter of '21, where EBITDA was positive CAD68 million.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to Mark Ayranto, our Chief Operating Officer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Ayranto:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Marty. And good morning or afternoon, everybody. Starting off to emphasize John's point on safety. We're proud of the workforce and the strong safety culture and record that we enjoy in the Eagle Gold Mine. As John mentioned 2.7 million lost time instant hours free and that's extends over two years. That combined with our total recordable injury frequency which is consistently trended down since the commencement of production at Eagle and currently stands at an industry enviable, 1.1 year-to-date.</p><p>The third quarter this year. saw us working through some operational challenges, most notably in the quarter we stacked 2.1 million tonnes of ore on the heap leach pad. The stacking rate was below our planned -- below our plan, due to higher than expected unplanned maintenance as well as the shutdown in July for local forest fire activities. That said, we continue to optimize our maintenance schedules, supply-chain, inventory and labor force, and we expect to see our crushing and conveying assets show higher availability as these improvements are implemented. Despite these challenges, there were some significant highlights in the third quarter. We mined 5.1 million tonnes of ore and waste in the quarter and that's an increase of approximately 18% quarter-over-quarter. The improvement was largely due to a combination of haulage fleet performance and shorter waste hauls, as we successfully established a new waste dump location late in the third quarter.</p><p>Despite lower than planned tonnes stack, our leaching performance on the heap leach pad was strong in the third quarter. Recoveries are continuing to trend inline with our forecasted levels and we saw an approximate 7,000 ounce reduction in our [Indecipherable] 0:12:01.9 inventory in the quarter. Our ore reserve reconciliation continues to be excellent with an average grade stacked in the quarter of 0.88 grams per tonne and an average over the first-nine months of the year of 0.84 grams per tonne, this is inline with our mine plan. As we've disclosed, following the end of the third quarter, stacking operations were down for approximately three weeks to repair our 1.5 kilometer. overland conveyor belt that connects the crushing circuit with the heap leach pad. And thankfully, due to having the required belting in inventory and the performance of our onsite maintenance and operations team, this repair was completed without any major issues.</p><p>As John highlighted, the initial resource at Raven, was a significant achievement for our exploration team. And they've been able to quickly turn our grassroots discoveries into a sizable resource with a grade of approximately 2.5 times that at the Eagle reserve grade. In addition to the 18,000 meters of drilling that is currently included in the Raven resource, we drilled approximately 25,000 meters at Raven during the 2022 field season, which we concluded in October. These results will be released as they're available, and will be included in an update resource for Raven, which we expect to release in the first half of 2023. And finally, I'd like to welcome to our management team. Tim Fisch, who joined us as Vice President and General Manager of the Eagle Gold Mine in October.</p><p>Tim, a metallurgist with over 40 years of experience, and we're very pleased to have him onboard on an onsite management capacity.</p><p>John, I'll turn it back to you for concluding remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Mark and Marty. In summary, the third quarter presented us with a number of challenges. But we also saw many indications that the Eagle Gold operation is in a strong position to improve its performance. We continue to work to deliver those results and the production levels that we know the mine is capable of.</p><p>Thank you all for listening and we'll now open the call to Q&amp;A.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, [Operator Instructions]. And john to get started, we have a question from Chris Thompson. Actually, Chris, has got his hand up, so, Chris, if you'd like to unmute.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Thompson:</emphasis></p><p>I'm here, can you here me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Thompson:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, look I just need -- I just need a sense, I guess of unit costs per tonne obviously, looking at -- I guess the ounces sold and the ounces produced on quarterly basis, I think, they were the highest quarterly ever. So it's some muddied the picture there, but I I was way out on my cost expectations, so. I just need you to sort of clarify what those costs -- unit costs are and what we can anticipate on a forward-looking basis? And I totally understand, inflationary concerns and what have you? Maybe just speak and just clarify that, please? Did you get that up Marty? [Indecipherable] 0:15:36.5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>Now Chris, it's a little bit different because when we do our unit costs, our mining costs, processing and G&amp;A per tonne, we include a number of capital items, such as capitalized stripping and so the numbers aren't going to match to the financials, where you're looking at cash costs and operating costs that are not capitalized.</p><p>What I can say is, answer the second part of your question, and get back to you on the tonnage later and try to break-out those capitalized numbers. But you did ask about the differential between ounces produced and ounces sold. And what I can tell you is, generally, what you'll see is our sales ounces are 5% below our production ounces and that's due to the royalty which we pay in kind or in metal to Osisko Royalty. So that 5% will always be a difference. Any difference above or below that 5% is purely due to timing of shipments and we ship every couple of weeks. So, you'll see this quarter were about 7% or 8% below production or at last quarter, we might have been a little bit less than 5%. So five is normal other than that is timing.</p><p>I can talk about the cost a little bit. When you look at our unit costs, we're really being hit on both sides. So the numerator, obviously is costs and as you mentioned, Chris, that is up significantly due to inflation and the denominator is due to ounces and compared to a year ago, we did produce 10% less ounces and we sold about 14% less ounces. And so that's why you're seeing a very significant increase in our unit costs. And just to touch on the inflation subject a little bit, it deserves some attention. If you look at a year-ago. Just for example, look at fuel, which is one of our larger cost drivers, a year ago, we were paying approximately CAD1 per liter of fuel delivered to site. During Q3, it hit a high of CAD2, so 100% increase. Now that was the highest we've seen at CAD2 and it's been settling back down and most recently, we're paying CAD1.70 to CAD1.80 per ounce delivered to site.</p><p>So it's just a massive inflationary hit. It does get our direct cost of fuel, but as you can imagine, lower fuel costs indirectly hit everything from travel and supply delivery too our consumables, so, it's across the-board. So our current costs are reflecting that CAD1.80 per ounce delivered to site and if it goes up, our costs will go up a little bit and we do hope that there is some more relaxation coming over the next little bit and we will experience some savings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Thompson:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Marty. Just one more quick question, if you would, maybe just update us on plans for Project 250, is it off the table now or is it something that we can see sort of maybe commencing next year?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's John. Chris, we've got to learn to walk, before we run. Right now, our goal is to get to 200,000 ounces per year in 2023. We still think something plus 200,000 is achievable, but we want to get to the steady state 200,000 and then we'll worry about going to plus 200,000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chris Thompson:</emphasis></p><p>All right. John, thank you very much. Marty. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Okay and Mark has a question.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marcus Giannini:</emphasis></p><p>Hey guys, this is Marcus calling in for Heiko, can you guys hear me alright.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marcus Giannini:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Regarding the downtime on the crushing and conveying circuit, can you provide an estimate for the indirect expenses and this downtime and can you give us an estimate as to the direct cash costs involved in fixing it back up? Just trying to get a sense of terms nothing exact needed?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. [Indecipherable], the direct costs were probably in the order of CAD1 million, that's the cost of the conveyor plus the cost of a contractor to come to site to assist us with installation of the new conveyor. Marty, if you got an estimate on cost of the lost delayed ounces?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>If we're specifically chatting about the delayed ounces due to the conveyor, which was, as you'll recall, approximately a three week down. That equates to about 15,000 ounces and 15,000 ounces In Canadian dollars is approximately CAD33 million, which is going to be deferred.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marcus Giannini:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, got you and then just following up on the conveyor expenses and a prior release you talked about using the downtime to take care of some other maintenance needs, what exactly was done during the quarter? And should we budget some higher expenditures in our cash-flow model for the quarter given maintenance that was essentially pulled forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Mark can you summarize the work that was done in addition to the conveyor?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Ayranto:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Marcus, I think in general, you really don't need to be putting in any extra cost items that would have been, we've brought some of that work forward opportunistically. We built rebuilds, one of the crusher, hence. We did [Indecipherable]0:21:37.3 some skirt liners. We did a bit of work on our grasshopper and a little bit shoe work on the liner. So really nothing, nothing that sits outside of normal-course.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marcus Giannini:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, fair enough. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Great and Dominique [Indecipherable], has a question, Dominique?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>[Technical Issues].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. I can hear you, Dominique.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you, for taking my question. Let's go -- [Technical Issues].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah Dominique, it's John McConnell. I don't think your microphone is working very well. But I can read your question in the chat. And I think what you're asking is, if we anticipate the grade will come down from the 0.88 to closer to 0.7 in future years as per the mine plan? And that is correct, life-of-mine is lower-grade. So we do expect, these grades at plus 0.8 to continue for the next two years and then you will see the grade drop closer to 0.7.</p><p>Mark, do you have anything to add to that, if I didn't hear the question completely?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Ayranto:</emphasis></p><p>No I think gets. I think you nailed it. Well, John.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Anything further, Dominique. Thank you. [Technical Issues] Thank you for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, Thank you. And Mohammed has a question. Go ahead Mohammad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, John, Marty. And Mark, thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys hear me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, fine.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Yeah. So just to maybe dive in a little bit more on the cost pressures that you're seeing. So I know that you talked about the cost pressures faced on the fuel side, have you experienced anything on the labor side during this quarter?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>No, we didn't make any adjustments to salaries or wages during the quarter. One thing, I would say though is that, we are still below ideal employment levels, in other words, we're operating with less people than we really need and we make-up for that by using subcontractors and generally the contractors are little more expensive than your own employees. So. I don't have an exact number for you, but we do see higher costs around labor and lower productivity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Sounds good. Thanks. That's pretty helpful. And I think just my second question on the updated mine plan and technical report that's coming in the first half of next year. What could we expect from this, I know that you had some positive exploration results. Would there be any update to the reserve and resource or would mainly be to reset production cost expectations given the mine plan had a slightly lower cost for next year compared to what you've been seeing for the last three quarters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Mark, do you want to address that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Ayranto:</emphasis></p><p>Sure. Yeah. Mohammed there is. really two technical reports, one will be for Raven. You recall, we just -- as we just talked about we just released that. We will incorporate the 25,000 meters of drilling that occurred this year. That's the technical report with its associated resource and estimate that we expect to be in the first-half of the year. So probably that -- it always takes a bit of time to get those results. And so. I would expect sometime in Q2. For Eagle, the technical reports for that project, we were aiming for Q1. And certainly, we are looking to reset costs, mine plan. We did do some drilling that we've we've announced that's both laterally and to depths at Eagle. So we're looking to see how much of that drilling will increase or replace reserves and we'll get that out in Q1. Most interestingly, are the ounces laterally. Obviously, they come a bit earlier in the wind plant and at better cost. So that's what we're looking to do it Q1 of 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And just last question from me on, I guess, your cash balance and your current liquidity position. So, just noting that you have about one CAD15 million outstanding on your facility -- your credit facility, now about CAD60 million outstanding in your term facility available -- and CAD60 million available in your term facility. Are you comfortable with the level of liquidity that you have given your commitment and CapEx needs over the next four quarters?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Marty?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, Mohammed. When we look out into 2023, we feel we're in good shape cash-wise, we're looking at a lot of different scenarios and working through our budgets now, as well as lots of sensitivities. So we feel with the room we've got remaining on our revolving credit facility and our cash that we're in good shape. That being said, when we start stressing, some of our cases and if there's shocks on the gold price or operations or exchange rates if inflation goes even higher than we're seeing now. Then, our cash balance becomes tight. So we're always looking at ways to add to our flexibility. You'll recall earlier this year, we added. to our revolving credit facility as we paid down our term facility. So there some opportunities to do that same take program this year. That being said, we do think we have enough, but it's always nice-to-have a little more flexibility in what's a little bit of uncertain times surrounding inflation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Sounds good. Thanks a lot. That's very helpful. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, just if anyone else has any questions, please raise your hand. Okay, John. You can unmute yourself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. John, I see that. We had to raise equity and borrow a little money to finance the company this year. And with the gold price falling things. I guess, are a little tougher as well as costs. I mean, inflationary pressures. What is the game plan next year to maybe repay a little bit of debt and avoid going to raise equity to borrow?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we did not raise equity this year, John. But I'll let Marty address the liquidity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Just to confirm, John, and John, we did raise a small amount of equity early in the year, specifically for exploration. So we raised CAD20 million flow through at a significant premium to the share price due to tax -- Canadian tax law. So we did raise CAD20 million, that is specifically earmarked for exploration primarily at Raven. Of that CAD20 million equity we raised early in the year-earlier in the year, we spent approximately half of it, so CAD10 million and we still have CAD10 million remaining that we can spend next year on Raven. On the debt side, you're right, we did have a net to draw on our debt. We paid down significant debt on our term-loan, but borrowed a little more on our revolver. So certainly as we head into next year, again, we're finalizing all of our numbers and it's going to depend on production and gold price and inflation, but we are focused on paying down debt and that's what we're going to do with all of our free-cash flow from next year. And we do anticipate being able to completely pay-off the term debt next year, again, dependent on gold prices and production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Okay and Mohammed has a question again. Go ahead Mohammad.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry guys, just one last one for me on that your growth CapEx guidance of $18 million for the year. Just looking at what you had quarter-to-date total spend of about $17 million including your growth, exploration of $13 million. So when I'm looking at your total growth CapEx and exploration guidance of $31 million compared to $17 million. Do you expect the span of $14 million in Q4 or should we deferred out into 2023?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Marty?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>You lost me, a little bit on those numbers Mohammed. I want to make sure we're not confusing, U.S. and Canadian because we do switch around a little bit, John.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Absolute.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>So you're looking at, just on growth capital?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>I'm looking at both growth CapEx and growth, exploration to bear me just tie-back into what your quarter-to-date spend was? Maybe I'm not including everything that I'm seeing. So just wanted to get maybe a reconciliation of that quarter-to-date?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marty Rendall:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, if you look at our -- if we look at our growth capital, exploration is essentially done. Our exploration program, Raven wrapped up in October, there may be some small costs CAD1 million or less for [Indecipherable] and camp cleanup. But it's essentially done growth exploration. We will have a little more growth capital in Q4. Some of it to do with the water treatment plant and pad expansion a couple of other smaller things, but we do anticipate somewhere between CAD5 million to CAD10 million in Q4 in growth exploration and capital.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>That's perfect. Thanks a lot. That's very clear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Just checking if anyone else has a question than could you please raise your hand. Okay, well thank you everyone for your questions. As there are no further questions, we will close the meeting. Have a great day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John McConnell:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks everyone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-2acfef18aaa754fbbe6afb63d1fb3056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB1-CR53-RTPJ-54C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 AlphaStreet Inc.

After all, that's a lot of pages, and a lot of money! There was the $900 billion in coronavirus relief aid\u2014the second-largest stimulus measure in U.S. history. There was the $1 billion for two new Smithsonian museums. There was the $10 million for \"gender programs\" in Pakistan. There was the creation of a special authority to control doping in horseracing. And finally, at last, there was the long-awaited repeal of criminal penalties for using Smokey Bear's likeness without permission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oh.</p><p>According to Section 711 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, those who leverage Smokey Bear for profit\u2014on a t-shirt, a book, in a live costume setting\u2014currently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/711#:~:text=Whoever%2C%20except%20as%20authorized%20under,the%20Forest%20Service%2C%20United%20States\">face six months incarceration</url> for their crime. The iconic character was conceived in the 1940s and has evangelized about the importance of fire safety ever since. \"Only YOU Can Prevent Wildfires,\" he exhorts. Used incorrectly, however, and it's off to prison for you. Who knew Smokey was such a hard-ass?</p><p>A deep dive into Smokey's <url normalizedValue=\"https://smokeybear.com/guidelines/SmokeyBearUseGuidelines.pdf\">regulations</url> show that he keeps a tight ship. Those interested in using the character for any commercial endeavors must be licensed by the feds, and the purpose\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">must</emphasis> further wildfire prevention. Without that license, Smokey adherents risk fines and prison time. \"Report suspected violations directly to the national Program Manager [of the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Program], who shall take action necessary, up to and including civil and criminal court actions, to stop the violator,\" the government instructs.</p><p>There's little breathing room in that guidance. \"Smokey is not any agency's mascot and shouldn't be treated as such,\" a <url normalizedValue=\"https://smokeybear.com/guidelines/SmokeyBearCostumeUse.pdf\">brochure</url> reads. \"Areas that are especially subject to abuse: t-shirts and jacket art for fire crews, employees, and ranger districts\u2026 Smokey Bear's image will not be demeaned or tarnished.\" Abuse, indeed!</p><p>If given the green light for costume usage in the appropriate, government-approved forum, you better believe that Smokey expects only the best. \"Do NOT speak during costumed appearances unless equipped with the currently licensed Smokey Bear voice modulator system,\" the guidance says. Also, do NOT appear without \"at least one uniformed escort\" who must \"guide the Bear at the elbow\" and be able to espouse the tenets of wildfire prevention. \"A clean, private dressing room is necessary for putting on and taking off the costume,\" notes the rulebook. A diva if I've ever seen one.</p><p>If President Donald Trump signs the omnibus bill, no longer will Smokey be such an exclusive commodity: Prison time would be off the table for those interested in making and selling, say, a shirt with his stern, furry countenance. As former <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reason</emphasis> intern Ford Fischer <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FordFischer/status/1341165120198684673?s=20\">points out</url>, his likeness is currently on a pillow produced in Europe, though Amazon has had to block sales in the United States.</p><p>The Smokey debacle may seem trivial. That's because it is. But, in true form, it epitomizes just how mundane and, yes, trivial government waste can be. We have the criminal justice angle! (Prison time for making a Smokey Bear shirt? Really?) We have the licensing angle! (You need a permit to wear a Smokey costume, which is only produced by a licensed contractor and sold only to a government agency.) We have the bureaucracy angle! (We shelled out taxpayer dollars so that someone could type up a Smokey guidebook ordering costumed bears to make good use of their \"paws, head, and legs\" so that they can be \"effective.\" Like, we really did that.)</p><p>And we also have the Congress-is-dysfunctional angle. After all, Smokey Bear somehow weaseled his way into a government funding bill that Americans have been waiting on for months\u2014a bill that was so long that no congressperson had the time to actually read it. This isn't new: Lawmakers are skilled at stuffing bizarre, unrelated measures into funding bills, like the time Democrats tried to mandate <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com.test/2020/03/12/dems-want-to-combat-coronavirus-by-mandating-paid-sick-leave-for-stalking-victims/\">paid sick leave for stalking victims</url> and Republicans <url normalizedValue=\"https://reason.com.test/2020/07/28/senate-republicans-1-trillion-covid-19-relief-bill-includes-billions-for-new-fighter-jets-attack-helicopters-and-missiles/\">attempted to set aside billions for new weapons</url>, both in COVID-19 relief legislation.</p><p>In this case, at least, the amendment in question will (hopefully) scrub one more meaningless crime from the books. Only YOU Can Prevent Overcriminalization!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CORRECTION: The government apparently prefers that we refer to Smokey the Bear as \"Smokey Bear.\" I don't see anything in the spending bill decriminalizing the \"the,\" so I've changed it just to be safe.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSNMMC-CongressLegalizesSmokeyBearImpersonations</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSNMMC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G63-H8C3-S9K0-D3XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494996</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reason Foundation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Reason (Magazine)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65828\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Still, many questions are circulating about <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL089858\">why forest fires are becoming larger and more severe</url> - and what can be done about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is climate change fueling these fires? Does the long history of fighting every fire play a role? Should we leave more fires to burn? What can be done about Western forests' vulnerability to wildfires and climate change?</p><p>We invited 40 fire and forest ecologists living across the Western U.S. and Canada to examine the latest research and answer these questions in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/19395582/0/ja\">set of studies</url> published Aug. 2, 2021. Collectively, we are deeply concerned about the future of Western forests and communities under climate change.</p><p>So, why are wildfires getting worse? </p><p>Climate change is a big part of it. Summer wildfire seasons are <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms8537\">already 40 to 80 days longer</url> on average than they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/313/5789/940.full.pdf\">30 years ago</url>. Annual <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607171113\">droughts are more pronounced</url>, making it easier for fuels to dry out and fires to ignite and spread. Extreme weather events, marked by dry fuels, <url normalizedValue=\"http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259100\">lightning storms</url> and strong winds, are also <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091377\">increasingly common</url> and provide essential ingredients for rapid fire growth, as witnessed by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/19/climate/bootleg-wildfire-weather.html\">Bootleg Fire</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/wildfires/2021/07/we-need-to-be-prepared-for-anything-bootleg-fire-crews-wary-of-coming-heat-wave.html\">burning in Oregon</url> and record-setting fires in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/us/gigafire-california-august-complex-trnd/index.html\">California</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cpr.org/2021/01/25/colorados-east-troublesome-wildfire-may-signal-a-new-era-of-big-fire-blow-ups/\">Colorado</url> in 2020.</p><p>Ironically, a chronic lack of fire in Western landscapes also contributes to increased fire severity and vulnerability to wildfires. It allows dry brush and live and dead trees to build up, and with more people living in wildland areas to spark blazes, pressure to fight every forest fire has increased the risk of extreme fire. </p><h>The problem with fighting every wildfire</h><p>Historically, fire was a regular visitor to most Western forests, except moist locations like those along the Pacific Northwest coast and in British Columbia. Frequent or periodic fires from Indigenous burning and lightning strikes created patchworks of grasslands, shrublands and regenerating forests of all ages.</p><p>Past fires influence the way subsequent fires burn and what they leave behind. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2020/10/06/what-the-forest-service-can-learn-from-indigenous-fire-management/\">Indigenous burning practices</url> not only enhance cultural resources and wildlife habitat but also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/california-wildfires-cultural-burns-indigenous-people\">reduce the amount and connectedness of fuels</url> that drive large, severe wildfires. Similarly, patchy burns from lightning ignitions create forest landscapes that are less likely to burn all at once.</p><p>The U.S. and Canada effectively suppress all but <url normalizedValue=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6254/1280.summary\">2%-3% of wildfire starts</url>. However, this small percentage of fires burn at the height of each fire season, when dry conditions and extreme fire weather thwart even the most aggressive attempts to suppress them.</p><p>Unintentionally, by focusing on short-term risks of wildfires, the U.S. is predisposing forests to burn under the very worst conditions. Active fire suppression contributes to what is often referred to as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1315088111\">wildland fire paradox</url> - the more we prevent fires in the short term, the worse wildfires become when they return.</p><p>In one of the new studies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=phessburg\">Paul Hessburg</url> and co-authors explain how fire managers can mitigate the severity of future fires by managing fire-excluded forests to foster resilience to wildfires and drought. <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2432\">Management approaches</url> include thinning dense forests, reducing fuels through prescribed burning and managing wildfires to restore more typical patterns of forests, meadows, shrublands and woodlands.</p><p>In a second paper, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keala-Hagmann\">Keala Hagmann</url> and her co-authors describe how more than a century of fire exclusion and past forest management practices have <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2431\">jeopardized forest biodiversity and social and ecological values</url>, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.5849/jof.2016-043R2\">culturally important resources</url>, the quantity and quality of water, stability of carbon stores, recreation and air quality.</p><p>For example, fire exclusion has compromised aspen stands - <url normalizedValue=\"https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/defaults/s7526c88h\">biodiversity hot spots</url> for everything from bears to butterflies. Increased forest cover diverts water from downslope meadows, allowing conifer forests to further encroach on aspen habitat.</p><h>A path forward</h><p>Amid the daunting reality of climate change and severe wildfires, there is a path forward for Western forests.</p><p>In a third article, <url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wW8Y_TkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Susan Prichard</url> and her co-authors examine which <url normalizedValue=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.2433\">adaptive forest management approaches</url> have worked to increase resilience to wildfires and climate change. There is strong scientific evidence that fuel reduction treatments - including forest thinning, prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning and managed wildfires - are effective approaches for mitigating future fire impacts to Western forests. However, land managers can't expect these treatments to work if they are applied to only a small fraction of Western forest landscapes. </p><p>When combined, forest thinning and prescribed burning in dry ponderosa pine and in dry and moist mixed-conifer forests have been shown to be highly effective at reducing the fire damage to forests. However, this type of treatment is not appropriate for all forest types. Fire managers in some wilderness areas and national parks have allowed fires started by lightning to burn in some wind and weather conditions. Over the past 40-plus years, these wildfires have been allowed to burn and reburn landscapes, generally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24700425\">limiting the size and severity of subsequent wildfires</url>.</p><p>Given the immense diversity of Western forests, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, in forests that historically supported more frequent fire, revitalizing and continuing cultural burning practices, prescribed burning, and forest thinning combined with prescribed burning can reduce overcrowding and the potential for severe fires. Thinning and prescribed burning <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/research/highlights/highlights_display.php?in_high_id=1385\">aren't appropriate or feasible</url> everywhere. In reality, only a portion of landscapes can be treated this way. Allowing wildfires to burn in more areas under moderate weather conditions is also part of the solution.</p><p>Promoting resilient Western forests will require that our society builds a new relationship with fire by creating fire-adapted communities and looking for opportunities to restore fire to Western forest landscapes.</p><p>In this era of warmer, drier summers and longer fire seasons, there are no fire- or smoke-free solutions. The current approach to fire management poses unnecessarily high stakes for Western forests. There is no doubt that the future of Western forests is a fiery one. How we choose to live with fire is still up to us.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation's newsletter to understand the world.</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/us/newsletters/the-daily-3?utm_source=TCUS&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-text&amp;utm_content=100Ksignup\">Sign up today</url>.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Susan J.

Social media platforms and mainstream media outlets are breeding grounds for the spread of misinformation, slanderous discussions and unethical practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The polarization of this election was catalyzed by former President Donald Trump, whose campaign practices involved spreading fraudulent news and sparking an insurrection through volatile Twitter posts and outright lies, especially regarding his denial of the election results. Though the decisions of most social media platforms to suspend the former President's accounts were met with a collective sigh of relief, the task of preventing \"fake news\" is far from over. In fact, it is vital to our democracy that we push for more thorough practices of fact-checking to stint the dissemination of false information.</p><p>Trust in the public has been corroded through continual malpractice and manipulation, which has, in turn, spawned controversy, rabbit-hole conspiracy theories and social groups that have taken it upon themselves to act on these proposed falsehoods. Groundless organizations like QAnon have formed as a result of this indulgence of falsehoods; they can only be considered misguided robinhoods acting in the pursuit of personal gains, while furthering their bigot-filled, antisemitic and purely ridiculous agenda (the story of QAnon is another tangent I will not go into today). These organizations have grown to fruition due to the explosive accelerant that is former President Trump.</p><p>Beyond a failed, racist presidency, Donald Trump has forever changed the way we consume and trust the media. But, what more can we expect from a near fascist president that has force-fed propaganda to his citizens?</p><p>As president, he deflected every shrivel of fact or evidence that painted him in a bad light or shed truth on the many lies that he and his team purported, as if a bottle of water could extinguish a forest fire. The best example to illustrate this is the response from President Trump's team following the insurrection. To preface; before the insurrection, the former president's rhetoric at events and rallies bubbled to push his mindless followers to commit the final act of the circus production that was the Trump presidency: a reckless and pell-mell attack on our democracy. Despite being the benefactor of the chaos, then-President Trump expresses no culpable sentiments regarding his actions and accusations as being the initiator of the violence. This is ironic in consideration of his 'Save America' rally, where he urged his followers to \"fight like hell\" and implored them to voice their concerns right down at Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>A post-Trump society is one of dishonesty and shameless lying that affects more than just media consumption. The path to rebuilding public trust starts with the Biden administration and a necessity for transparency. After four years of lies and corruption, the American people need a president that can look beyond the dollar sign and reach the people. It is our responsibility to hold President Joe Biden accountable for his promises. Yet this notion of accountability is not limited to the President, it extends to every politician.</p><p>President Biden stated during his inauguration speech on Jan. 20 the requirement that we \"must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated, and even manufactured.\" It is a relieving change to see that the President acknowledges the dangers of misinformation and poor political tactics, but as conscious consumers of social media and citizens, we need to take every word with a grain of salt. The insurrection, again, is a prime example of the minacious nature of \"fake news,\" and although it should not have taken an act of domestic terrorism to wake America up, it was a necessary call to action.</p><p>Both social media platforms and bodies of government hold a responsibility to reflect upon and re-evaluate their policies regarding the distribution of media. In this regard, there is a heated conversation revolving around the idea of \"freedom of speech\" and the corporations in America that regulate the people's speech. However, it is not only a necessity, but a responsibility for these companies to moderate the type of content that is distributed to the masses. While regurgitating false information to support your ideals may seem like a harmless declaration of \"opinion,\" it can easily be entrapped in the snowball effect and create baleful consequences that infringe on the safety and wellbeing of our society as a whole. The creation of recuperative policies and actions - and hopefully, one day, preemptive ones - will pave the way to slowly rebuilding public trust.</p><p>About the Contributor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4898448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:620W-R5V1-DY7P-T32R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Old Gold and Black: Wake Forest University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 14, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Winston Salem</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSAS</classCode><className>DISINFORMATION &amp;

I really do. Rep. Cheney has conducted herself honorably for the past nine months. Her courage in telling the truth about the election and the insurrection of Jan. 6 has been punished by the Republican conference, which booted her from leadership and replaced her with the lying, scheming Trumpist, Rep. Elise Stefanik. Former President Donald Trump is apparently working feverishly to unseat Cheney from Congress altogether, and his lickspittle lieutenants are joining the effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The invertebrate minority leader, Kevin McCarthy - who, let's recall, declared on Jan. 13 that \"the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters\" - has long since scurried back under Trump's skirts, from whence he issues barbs against the few remaining Republicans who still have some principles. McCarthy sniped that Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican appointed to the Jan. 6 committee over the objections of party leadership, are \"Pelosi Republicans.\"</p><p>The opening segments of the Jan. 6 committee were another fine moment for Cheney. She began by thanking the police officers who testified about their experiences defending the Capitol that day:</p><p>\"Thank you to each of the witnesses appearing before us today. ... You defended the Constitution and our Republic, and every American owes you our undying gratitude. Every American, I hope, will be able to hear your testimony today and will watch the videos. The videos show the unbelievable violence and the inexcusable and intolerable cruelty that you all faced, and people need to know the truth.\"</p><p>She went on to outline the stakes:</p><p>\"If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.\"</p><p>Those are good words, and as I said above, I respect Cheney's willingness to pay a price. She understood that by taking on the \"Big Lie\" and the almost-as-consequential lie about what happened on Jan. 6, she was risking her leadership position, her seat and possibly her own security. Every word of truth that she (and Kinzinger) utters is like a balm of Gilead.</p><p>And yet, the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, \"Is it too late?\"</p><p>Both Cheney and Kinzinger, may they live to be 120, had many, many earlier opportunities to extinguish this forest fire before it became a raging inferno. Both supported Trump's reelection in 2020. Kinzinger said he was \"upset\" by President Joe Biden's victory. Cheney appeared on \"Fox and Friends\" in July 2020, and while she allowed that she disagreed with Trump on some issues, most notably withdrawal from Afghanistan, she emphasized how important it was that Trump be reelected: \"Whether or not we have debates and discussions internally - as I'm sure we continue, we will continue to do - we are going to be absolutely united going forward on the big issues, and I'm not going any place.\"</p><p>Both Cheney and Kinzinger voted against the first Trump impeachment. They stuck with their support for his reelection, despite the first debate with Biden, despite the catastrophic handling of COVID-19, despite Trump's green light to China's Uyghur camps, despite QAnon, and despite the avalanche of lies and cruelty that corrupted America's soul - and prepared the ground for the violent insurrection they are now investigating.</p><p>Is it welcome that they finally found a line they couldn't cross? A thousand times, yes. But how might this story have unfolded differently if they, and thousands of other Republicans, had found their uncrossable lines sooner?</p><p>You can say, \"The base is calling the shots, and the elected are just following what the voters demand.\" That's nonsense. The base doesn't get its ideas from nowhere. It gets them from Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and the rest of the conservative media world. And it gets them from elected officials. To paraphrase what Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn told the Jan. 6 committee: When elected officials give permission, there is no limit to the violence that may ensue.</p><p>Trump was the arsonist. But if every time he dropped a match on the dry tinder of American polarization, Republican elected officials and others had leaped to extinguish the small flames, we would not be here.</p><p>And where is here? We have seen the end of 160 years of the peaceful transfer of power. We've seen the majestic United States Capitol turned into a scene from a dystopian fantasy; an armed mob attempting to subvert an election. They smashed and tortured and caused deaths. They erected a gallows and hunted for the speaker of the House and for the vice president. And Republicans, almost to a man and woman, are excusing, downplaying or whitewashing what happened. An entire political party has abandoned commitment to the rule of law.</p><p>To speak up now, well, it's better than nothing. But it's a little like saying you'll take away a drunk's driver's license after he crashed into and killed an 8-year-old. What about all of those times when you saw him get behind the wheel after five drinks and did nothing?</p><p>Trump attacked the basics of American democracy. The consequences were foreseeable. There were countless warnings. The great tragedy of this moment is not that Trump attempted what he did, but that so few Republicans tried to stop him when it would have made a difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the \"Beg to Differ\" podcast.

Named \"Memorial Trees for Heroes\", this commitment aims to provide healthcare providers, hospital employees, caregivers and first responders the legacy they deserve for their sacrifice and to help ease financial burden on their families.</p><p>The pandemic has forced the families of frontline workers to make critical end-of-life planning and financial decisions during an incredibly vulnerable period. Choosing a resting place for loved ones is even more challenging in a time of unprecedented crisis. Further, a traditional burial, plot, and headstone costs around $15,000, a heavy load on a grieving family. The \"Memorial Trees for Heroes\" initiative gives frontline heroes a plan for a future ceremony in a serene resting place that includes a personalized memorial service and a legacy of conservation at no cost. The company is first offering memorial trees from its protected coastal Mendocino County forest, where families of fallen frontline workers across the country may enroll to reserve a tree.</p><p>\"We want to do our part to recognize these brave men and women on the frontline against COVID-19 and give them the beautiful legacy they deserve,\" said Sandy Gibson, co-founder and CEO of Better Place Forests. \"As someone who has found peace in my visits to my parents' graves from a young age, I want to provide these families and friends of fallen COVID-19 heroes with a peaceful, uplifting and beautiful place to visit their loved one without having to worry about financial burden. It may not take away their loss or grief, but I want to try to bring solace in any small way I can. I want them to know that their hero's sacrifice is recognized.\"</p><p>Frontline heroes risk their lives every day as they care for victims of this disease. They've separated themselves from their own families; some have traveled to areas highly impacted by COVID-19; some have even come out of retirement to help. As of April 23, over 21,800 U.S. healthcare personnel have contracted COVID-19.</p><p>Better Place Forests' conservation memorial forests are the first sustainable alternative to cemeteries for people who choose cremation - where their final resting place is a private tree in a protected forest. Ashes are mixed with soil and placed beneath the tree, continuing the life cycle of the forest. A bronze, custom memorial marker, reminiscent of those used by the US Geological Survey (USGS) to mark important locations, is placed at the base of the tree.</p><p>For each tree reserved, Better Place Forests plants 25-400 Impact Trees in areas impacted by deforestation or forest fire through its partnership with One Tree Planted.</p><p>Reservations for a \"Memorial Trees for Heroes\" tree will begin immediately for the company's Point Arena forest in Mendocino County, California.</p><p>More Information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.betterplaceforests.com/heroes\">http://www.betterplaceforests.com/heroes</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCCLPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YVJ-HVK1-F06S-P0WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Close-Up Media, Inc.

Pictures release.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warner Bros. and New Line</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angelina Jolie s Those Who Wish Me Dead played as expected in 2021, while Jason Statham s Wrath of Man is catching fire overseas.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time in forever, there s actually multiple new releases which qualify as  newsworthy.  In domestic box office news that isn t<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spiral: From the Book of Saw </emphasis>(an underwhelming $8.4 million debut weekend), Taylor Sheridan s<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Those Who Wish Me Dead </emphasis>opened in theaters and on HBO Max this weekend. I can t speak for the HBO Max viewership, but the Angelina Jolie-starring action thriller earned $2.8 million this weekend. That s obviously miserable by the standards of prior Jolie actioners.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tomb Raider </emphasis>opened with $47 million 20 years ago and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mr. and Mrs. Smith </emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wanted </emphasis>both topped $50 million in the mid-2000 s, but that was back when people actually went to the movies just to see big movie stars in high-concept originals or new-to-you adaptations.</p><p>An R-rated star-driven action drama (about a firefighter trying to keep a boy safe from hitmen amid a forest fire) based on a novel boasting no franchise or fantasy elements is the kind of thing everyone claims Hollywood doesn t make and ignores when Hollywood does. Warner Bros. released a slew of old-school movies in late 2019 and early 2020 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blinded By the Light, Motherless Brooklyn, The Good Liar, The Way Back, The Kitchen, Richard Jewell, The Sun is Also A Star, </emphasis>etc.). They all played to empty auditoriums while moviegoers splurged on the two R-rated killer clown movies (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It Chapter 2 </emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joker</emphasis>). When AT&amp;T talks about some Warner Bros. releases getting exclusive theatrical windows and others opening in theaters and HBO Max, that s the reason.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;</p><p>&lt;figcaption&gt;</p><p>ARMY OF THE DEAD - (L-R) NORA ARNEZEDER as LILLY, SAMANTHA WIN as CHAMBERS, ANA DE LA REGUERA as CRUZ, DAVE BAUTISTA as SCOTT WARD and OMARI HARDWICK as VANDEROHE.</p><p>Netflix</p><p>&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>In what could be a sign of things to come, Netflix opened one of their streaming originals in around 450 theaters, mostly made up of Cinemark auditoriums. Zack Snyder s zombie actioner<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Army of the Dead </emphasis>debuts on Netflix on May 21, so this theatrical run is essentially a sneak preview/buzz-builder/media-friendly promotional gimmick. If this needs to be said, nobody with any sense was expecting blockbuster numbers, or even 5% of the $26.7 million earned by Snyder s<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dawn of the Dead </emphasis>remake on its debut weekend in 2004. Even if<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Army of the Dead </emphasis>had opened in non-Covid times as a conventional  big movie of the week,  I still wouldn t expect an original, R-rated, 144-minute zombie actioner to pull a $25 million debut in this day and age.</p><p>A $780,000 opening weekend is  fine  in terms of the circumstances. Its $1,860 per-theater average was second-best this weekend behind<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spiral. </emphasis>This was about announcing that the Dave Bautista-led heist caper was a big-deal movie. That s the importance of this release, that Netflix is using a major theatrical chain to release a movie in theaters as a way of saying  This Netflix original is a big friggin deal.  And yeah, having seen the film on Thursday night on a very big screen, it works as intended. I have nitpicks and complaints, but it might be Netflix s best  mockbuster  ever, and certainly among the few that really looks, feels and plays like the genuine article. So in terms of using theatrical to build buzz for streaming, mischief managed.</p><p>&lt;figure&gt;</p><p>&lt;figcaption&gt;</p><p>Jason Statham in Guy Ritchie's 'Wrath of Man'</p><p>\u00a9 2021 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Inc. All Rights Reserved</p><p>&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>MGM and Miramax s<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wrath of Man </emphasis>grossed $3.74 million (-59%) in weekend two for a $14.602 million ten-day cume. So, after opening with a  normal for Jason Statham  $8.1 million, it s not any leggier. The brutal and violent R-rated heist caper/revenge drama opened in China this Monday and earned $7.1 million in the first three days before earning another $8.7 million over its  opening weekend.  That gives it a solid $18.5 million thus far.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">London Has Fallen </emphasis>and Statham s<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mechanic: Resurrection </emphasis>nabbed over/under $50 million totals in China which almost single-handedly made them hits. But<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wrath of Man </emphasis>isn t just relying on China this time, as it has earned $11.4 million in Russia and $41.4 million overseas in total for a $56 million worldwide cume.</p><p>Meanwhile, in arbitrary milestones,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Godzilla Vs. Kong </emphasis>has now earned $427 million worldwide, above the $426.5 million global cume of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bad Boys for Life</emphasis>. That makes the Warner Bros. and Legendary MonsterVerse sequel the biggest-grossing Hollywood title of both 2021 and 2020. So the Adam Wingard-directed flick is the biggest-grossing Hollywood movie since the year-end blitz of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frozen II </emphasis>($1.45 billion),<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jumanji: The Next Level </emphasis>($800 million) and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker </emphasis>($1.073 billion). We ll see how long it takes<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">F9 </emphasis>(opening in China and elsewhere this week but in North America on June 25) to pass that arbitrary benchmark.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nobody </emphasis>has earned $45 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raya and the Last Dragon </emphasis>now has $46.1 million, just $500,000 away from<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wonder Woman 1984</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-content_60a145e36f79f80006f05a7d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62PB-2FS1-JBCM-F1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 16, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Remember ? only you can prevent forest fires.</p><p> Smokey, who would later become Smokey \"the\" Bear after a song written by Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson (who also penned \"Frosty the Snowman\" and \"Peter Cottontail\") became a hit, is part of a list of famous bears both animals and humans.</p><p> While the following group bear-ly makes a dent in naming all the noteworthy bears out there (sorry, Bart, Baloo and Teddy), let's just grin and ? wait for it ? bear it.</p><p> \"The Bad News Bears\": Millennials will have to look up this nod to the 1976 comedy film starring Walter Matthau as Morris Buttermaker, the grumpy coach of the misfit Little League Team of the title. One of the little sluggers is young Oscar winner Tatum O'Neal.</p><p> Bear Bryant: Continuing the theme of sports in the features section, Paul William \"Bear\" Bryant was a college football player and coach best-known as head coach of the University of Alabama's football team. Bryant won an astonishing six national and 13 conference championships in his 25-year tenure as head coach.</p><p> Bear Grylls: The British adventurer, former member of the military and star of \"Man vs. Wild\" is a well-rounded outdoorsman who has climbed Mount Everest and worked with celebrities in the wilderness. Brave! Grylls, 45, also is the father of three children named Marmaduke, Huckleberry and Jesse, and he has reportedly eaten elephant dung.</p><p> The Care Bears: Can you name the original 10 cuddly and colorful characters from the 1980s? They are Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear and Wish Bear. You're welcome.</p><p> The 1985 Chicago Bears: Forget Mitchell Trubisky, Jay Cutler, Kyle Orton and Rex Crossman. The Chicago Bears quarterback I remember, under the tutelage of Mike Ditka, is Super Bowl-winning Jim McMahon and his teammates Walter Payton and William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry - and their \"Super Bowl Shuffle.\"</p><p> Fozzie: One of this famous Muppet's catchphrases is, \"Wocka, wocka!\" Largely overshadowed by Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy and the butt of jokes by Statler and Waldorf, Fozzi stands out for his good-naturedness and snazzy polka-dot scarf.</p><p> Winnie the Pooh: Ignoring the fact that he wears only a red short-sleeve shirt - scandalous! - I relate to Winnie, and like him, for his friendly, mild-mannered and philosophizing ways. We also both love - or are practically obsessed with - honey. It's Winnie the Pooh ... and Eeyore, too.</p><p> Yogi Bear: The resident of Jellystone National Park since 1958, Yogi Bear, while always respectfully addressing Ranger Smith, also was most certainly a thorn in the ranger's side with all the hijinks he created with trusty sidekick, Boo Boo. Boo ? and bye!</p><p> Fozzie was created by Jim Henson Jerry Juhl and Frank Oz.</p><p>Disney</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-36937202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YV5-6321-DYFF-80PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"493\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 6, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>CHICAGO BEARS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Coaches</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzcwQkQ0Q0E1NEJCNEY1M0JFRTBFQzY0NjBENEYxNjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000081</classCode><className>AMERICAN FOOTBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp;

The seed, the Prussian military system, which sprouted, grew and matured into the merciless military machine, which Allied and American soldiers broke up two years ago in France, was planted then. It took root with the acquisition of the province of Schlesswig-Holstein by Germany when the German and Austrian-Hungarian armies defeated the armies of Denmark and, said Dr. Edward Howard Griggs, in his lecture last night at Seminary Hall, had France and England joined with Denmark in that war, there would not only have been no Franco-Prussian war, but no great world conflict such as just came to a conclusion.</p><p>The big forest fire that raged on South Mountain in the vicinity of Black Rock, threatened the destruction of the hotel at that point and other buildings, has been checked in the direction of these properties, but the fire is still burning furiously toward the top of the mountain.

Airy fire companies in a practice burning Saturday. The abandoned three-story frame house on the Willis estate a half mile east of New Market, burned from 10 a.m. until about 11:30 a.m. Fires were started in the upper floors of the building. The fire was used to train inexperienced members of the companies who have not as yet been assigned to fight a house fire. The men were directed by experienced members of the fire companies for the drill.</p><p>\"Perhaps the problem of drug abuse itself with both the adult and younger people is only a symptom of a more malignant danger which is growing in the recesses of the social system in which we live,\" said Dan Roff, Director of the Frederick County Mental Health Clinic, and member of the Advisory Committee to the Drug Abuse, summarized the problem at Frederick High School Saturday.</p><p>20 Years Ago</p><p>May 4, 2000</p><p>The arrival of a new county planning director on Monday was the latest in a series of changes among high-ranking managers in Winchester Hall, two years of turnover virtually unheard of in Frederick County government. Personnel officials say the changes represent the realities of a tight job market where talented people are in demand. It's also an example of an aging work force as more administrators look to retirement.</p><p>Md. 355 will be closed in sections Friday while up to 4,000 Avon walkers use the route to make their way from Hood College in Frederick to Washington.

The funding will support a project developing algorithms that will enable a fleet of smart and autonomous drones to assess situations, change course, stand up against environmental factors like wind, communicate with other drones and coordinate a strategy together, all with limited support from humans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NSF presents CAREER awards to early career faculty members who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization.</p><p>\"Dr. Afghah has established an excellent track record in the classroom and in her research in her time at NAU, and she is an emerging leader, especially in the important area of autonomous vehicles. We're proud to have her as a key member of the faculty in SICCS,\" said SICCS director and professor Ben Ruddell.</p><p>Afghah said drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), increasingly are being used for activities such as delivering packages, monitoring traffic, patrolling borders and maneuvering through difficult terrain or hazardous conditions.</p><p>\"They can be particularly useful in unstructured and unknown environments to provide agile surveying in natural disasters and search-and-rescue operations.\" But, she adds, because drones rely heavily on a human controller to program where they go and what they do, their effectiveness is limited.</p><p>Afghah's goal is to develop small, inexpensive, artificially intelligent drone systems that can observe, understand, adapt and respond to changing environments on their own and communicate with other autonomous vehicles to perform more sophisticated missions.</p><p>\"UAVs will be able to do the take-off, landing and task management all by themselves. If they are in a remote environment like a forest fire or disaster area, they will be able to inspect the area, conduct imaging or other tasks and coordinate between multiple UAVs--we don't want them all taking images of the same thing,\" Afghah said. \"Instead of using expensive aircraft with a pilot, we will be able to use multiple small UAVs capable of making the optimum decision in a given situation and determining the best coordination strategy with their teammates.\"</p><p>To enable the operation of a network of drones, Afghah says reliable communication is necessary among the UAVs and between the UAVs and the ground station to transmit videos and images they collect.</p><p>\"If we have a specific disaster, the default communication system may not be working. We need to be working on new communication techniques so drones can talk with each other. This type of communication requires high transmission rates and therefore a large radio bandwidth,\" she said. \"We will focus on developing spectrum management and co-existence strategies to facilitate drones' communication using 4G and 5G networks.\"</p><p>The five-year research project, scheduled to begin in mid-August, will have multiple phases. Afghah and her team will develop and test methods using computer simulations and then implement them on drones and test them indoors in a laboratory on campus and outdoors in the Centennial Forest near The Arboretum in Flagstaff.</p><p>\"We hope to have a proof-of-concept network of multiple drones that can handle coordination, communication and different missions such as target tracking, remote sensing and package delivery in an autonomous manner,\" Afghah said.</p><p>The project also offers opportunities for educational and outreach activities to engage elementary and middle school students through hands-on drone demonstrations and create enhanced public awareness about better technologies and new uses for UAVs.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7192091 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7192091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-7MW1-DYG2-R1YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In turn, these complex ecosystems face important challenges, including increases in carbon dioxide, warming, drought and fire, pest outbreaks and nitrogen deposition. The response of forests to these changes is largely mediated by microorganisms, especially fungi and bacteria. The effects of global change differ among boreal, temperate and tropical forests. The future of forests depends mostly on the performance and balance of fungal symbiotic guilds, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria, and fungal plant pathogens. Drought severely weakens forest resilience, as it triggers adverse processes such as pathogen outbreaks and fires that impact the microbial and forest performance for carbon storage and nutrient turnover. Nitrogen deposition also substantially affects forest microbial processes, with a pronounced effect in the temperate zone. Considering plant\u2013microorganism interactions would help predict the future of forests and identify management strategies to increase ecosystem stability and alleviate climate change effects. In this Review, we describe the impact of global change on the forest ecosystem and its microbiome across different climatic zones. We propose potential approaches to control the adverse effects of global change on forest stability, and present future research directions to understand the changes ahead.</p><p>In this Review, Baldrian et al. discuss the effects of global change on the forest ecosystem and its microbiome across boreal, temperate and tropical climatic zones, and present different strategies aimed at reducing global change impact on forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Forest ecosystems cover approximately 30% of Earth\u2019s land surface \u2014 42 million km2 \u2014 and store 45% of the carbon found in terrestrial ecosystems (Fig. 1), being responsible for 50% of terrestrial net primary production1. They also act as an important carbon sink that captures 7.6 Gt of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year2. Trees are the dominant primary producers in forests, and provide a multitude of habitats for microorganisms and other biota, such as the rhizosphere (soil surrounding plant roots) and phyllosphere (surface and interior of leaves). Trees also substantially influence the remaining parts of the ecosystem, mainly because they supply the bulk of the carbon that enters the forests. Some of this carbon is deposited in the soil by trees through roots or through the mycelia of root-symbiotic fungi in the form of simple organic molecules, whereas another fraction, represented by the dead biomass of wood, litter or roots, provides a pool of recalcitrant biopolymers3.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global distribution and features of forest ecosystems.</emphasis></p><p>Natural areas and properties of boreal, temperate and tropical forests are constrained by climatic factors: temperature, precipitation and length of the growing season. The diversity of tree vegetation at the plot scale increases from boreal to tropical forests. The temperate forest zone is the one most affected by forest management.</p><p>Structured by trees, forest ecosystems are complex and consist of multiple habitats of specific features and specific microbiomes4. The activity of these microbiomes, which comprise fungi, bacteria, archaea, protists and viruses, will determine the functioning of the forest. The role of microorganisms is especially important in the topsoil (composed of a litter layer, soil and roots of trees), where they mediate the cycling of nutrients. The litter layer, dominated by fungal activity, is a hot spot of recycling nutrients from plant biomass. Soil consists of more recalcitrant organic matter and the microbiomes are rich in bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi that transport carbon from roots to soil and nutrients from soil to trees5. Roots and rhizospheres are enriched on these plant-symbiotic fungi. Microbiomes of deadwood consist of microorganisms adapted to efficient decomposition and nitrogen limitation, that is decomposer fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria6. Specific, yet less abundant, are the microbiomes of tree phyllospheres and rock surfaces4. Fungi are the most studied forest microbes due to their important ecosystem functions. Mycorrhizal fungi are key to the mobilization and sequestration of nitrogen and phosphorus in forest soils, and in the transport of carbon from tree roots into soil. There are two major types of mycorrhizal symbioses: ectomycorrhizal, which can decompose organic matter and access organic nitrogen7 and are more efficient under nutrient limitation, and arbuscular mycorrhizal, which cannot decompose soil organic matter and are restricted to the use of mineral forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Saprotrophic fungi are important decomposers in forest litter and soils due to their wide range of extracellular enzymes that break down recalcitrant biopolymers, whereas plant pathogenic fungi may substantially affect ecosystem productivity through predation and reductions in host fitness and growth4. Bacteria represent another integral part of forest ecosystems, although they are less explored. In addition to their contribution to the decomposition of plant and microbial biomass8, bacteria substantially contribute to multiple nitrogen cycling processes, including the fixation of atmospheric N2, nitrification and denitrification6,9. Both bacteria and fungi contribute to nutrient mobilization by mineral weathering4. Protists, on the other hand, often act as predators on fungal or bacterial cells10. The role of archaea in forests is typically constrained to specific microhabitats, and their importance varies, contributing to, among other processes, methane (CH4) and nitrogen cycling11. Although viruses are common in forest soils12, the extent of their contribution to ecosystem processes remains unclear. The functions of the microbiome components should not be seen as separate. Decomposition and cross-feeding on decomposition products, mycorrhizal establishment, and predation on and decomposition of microbial biomass can be viewed as examples of processes integrating multiple microbiome components, as is also the case for the cycling of nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients (Fig. 2).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roles of the members of forest microbiomes.</emphasis></p><p>Fungi, bacteria, archaea, protists and viruses compose the forest microbiome. Although the roles of fungi and bacteria are widely studied and known, there is much less information about the other microbiome members. The abundance of archaea in forest soils appears rather limited and may be associated with specific habitats, such as forested peatlands. Protists and viruses are ubiquitous in forests and are known to affect the other members of the microbiome through predation and cell lysis, yet the extent of their importance is unclear. The biomass of dead microorganisms \u2014 fungi and bacteria \u2014 is largely recycled by the same two groups, with bacteria probably being more important in the process.</p><p>In this Review, we explore the varied effects of global change on forest microbiomes, including changes in microbial abundance and microbiome composition, as well as the impact on the performance of root-symbiotic fungi and microbial pathogens in soils and other habitats that are tightly linked to the forest ecosystem properties and processes (decomposition, nutrient cycling, carbon storage or greenhouse gas emissions). By combining observations of past development, experimental approaches simulating global change factors and observations on the realized niches of microorganisms and biogeochemistry, we discuss the ongoing and future changes in forest ecosystems across climatic zones. Finally, we provide an example of forest management strategies to mitigate adverse effects of global change on forest microbiomes and ecosystem performance and stability, and suggest forthcoming research directions needed to understand the future of global forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forests under global change</emphasis></p><p>Human activity has transformed the surface of the planet over millennia, having a major impact on land use and land cover worldwide. The deforestation and land-cover change associated with agriculture together with industrial activities induced a global change, which encompasses several phenomena and processes and has been intensified in the last centuries. Fossil fuel burning has locally increased the deposition of nitrogen and increased the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, a heat-trapping gas responsible for climate change through the warming of the atmosphere, ocean and land (global warming)13. The increase in temperature on the planet involves altered atmospheric circulation patterns and changes in precipitation regimes across the globe, causing heatwaves and drought events that are more intense and recurrent. Reduced precipitation and warmer weather increase the frequency and intensity of fires and induce the outbreaks of many pests14.</p><p>Similar to other biomes, forests both contribute to and are affected by these global change processes15\u201317 (Fig. 3). Because of their complex nature, the response of forest ecosystems to global change is both complex and context-dependent, but the decreased rates of global forest carbon storage appear to be one of the consequences of global change18. The carbon sink saturation and the increase in carbon losses in forests are the linked result of CO2 fertilization, rising air temperatures or drought impact and tree mortality. The understanding of forests under future environmental conditions, their functioning and the functioning of their microbiomes is still insufficient, but of critical importance for modelling, management and conservation purposes.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global change factors affecting forest ecosystems and their microbiomes.</emphasis></p><p>The most important processes that affect forest ecosystems independently from management decisions (such as conversion of forests to croplands) comprise globally occurring ones, such as elevated carbon dioxide concentration (eCO2) and warming, and those that vary in intensity across space, such as reduced precipitation and drought resulting from climatic factors, and nitrogen deposition derived from local anthropogenic pressure (industrial activity and transportation). Forest fires and pest outbreaks are local factors largely triggered by other global change processes that can make forest ecosystems susceptible to these disturbances. Although locally one of the global change factors may dominate in importance, forest ecosystems are always affected by their combination.</p><p>Elevated CO2 concentration (eCO2), warming and changes in precipitation and nitrogen deposition are the most important global change factors affecting forests, independent of land management decisions such as deforestation or transformation of natural forests into plantation forests (Fig. 3). Each factor has specific consequences, but they also act in combination. Among other consequences, climate-driven risks may compromise the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks across large spatial scales14.</p><p>Increasing CO2 concentrations were predicted to boost the net primary production of forests, but free-air CO2 enrichment experiments show that the net primary production increase diminishes over time19. The higher belowground carbon input under eCO2 is compensated by faster carbon turnover due to accelerated microbial growth, metabolism and respiration, higher enzymatic activities and priming of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus pools under warming20. Warming was the main driver of the global soil microbial biomass decrease of 3.4% observed between 1992 and 2013, especially at high latitudes with high soil microbial carbon stocks21. Although precipitation may both increase and decrease with changing climate, the latter phenomenon, leading to temporary or permanent drought, has a much stronger effect on ecosystems than the former. The combination of warming and drought may lead to the extinction of tree species22 and, ultimately, the replacement of tree cover by shrubs or grasses23. Drought affects a wide range of ecosystem properties, leading to the reduction in net primary production, soil carbon and microbial biomass, among other effects24.</p><p>Unlike other global change factors, atmospheric nitrogen deposition is spatially associated with human activity and, thus, is highly spatially variable25. As available nitrogen is often limiting in forests, nitrogen deposition may positively affect net primary production in such environments26, but it also increases phosphorus limitation in phosphorus-limited soils that are globally more common27. Nutrient limitation affects carbon storage as nutrient-rich forests show higher carbon use efficiency and, thus, sequester more carbon than nutrient-limited forests28. Similar to the change of CO2 concentrations, it is expected that atmospheric nitrogen deposition will increase in upcoming decades25.</p><p>The negative effects of global change, such as the combination of drought induced by warming and precipitation reduction, weaken forests. Dieback of suffering trees, triggered by dry and hot climatic conditions, has been documented on all continents29\u201331. Climate change led to an increased incidence of biotic pests in weakened trees but also in healthy trees, as the winter survival of insect pathogens is higher in warmer climates14. In positive feedback, forests weakened by insect or fungal pathogens are more sensitive to adverse climatic conditions and more prone to dieback29. Increased tree mortality combined with warmer and drier climatic conditions results in the observed increase in forest fire frequency, exposing larger areas of forest to fire risk across longer fire weather seasons32. Altogether, pest and fire incidence are significantly correlated with tree mortality and stress33. Climate models thus predict that tree mortality and connected disturbances, including forest fires, will further increase in the future33,34.</p><p>The future challenges to forest ecosystems may be partly offset by their ability to adapt. Tree mortality is taxonomically biased and changes species composition31, where trees and their mycorrhizal symbionts may, in the long term, adapt by migration through seedling establishment in places with more favourable conditions22. The change in vegetation is already visible in most global change experiments, especially when multiple factors are combined35. The potential of forest adaptation is, however, limited by the fact that forest resilience has already declined in the past decade due to a multitude of global change factors, in which water limitation and climate variability played major roles. More than 20% of intact undisturbed forests have already supposedly reached a critical threshold of resilience beyond which they experience further degradation36 and adaptation is less likely.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boreal, temperate and tropical forests under global change</emphasis></p><p>Although some aspects of global change appear to have universal consequences, their effects are largely modulated by the specific features of boreal, temperate and tropical forests and their microbiomes. This is because climatic and edaphic factors make these forests distinct in multiple aspects: the climate selects local tree species pools, and the diversity of dominant trees determines the turnover rate of organic matter and affects the composition of tree\u2013fungal symbioses involved in nutrient cycling (Fig. 1). Globally, the gross primary production of forests benefits from higher temperatures and precipitation, whereas net primary production saturates above a threshold of either 10 \u00b0C mean annual temperature or 1,500 mm precipitation37. In the past 20 years, boreal forests showed, on average, an increasing trend in resilience, probably benefiting from warming and fertilization through eCO2, which might have outweighed the adverse effects of climate change on tropical and temperate forests. With temperatures above the limit, temperate and tropical forests experienced a significant decline in resilience, probably related to increased water limitations and climate variability36. The future of forests and their microbiomes should thus be explored separately by forest type (Fig. 1).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boreal forests</emphasis></p><p>Because of slow decomposition limited by low temperatures and low nutrient contents, boreal forests (and analogous mountainous forests at higher altitudes in the temperate zone) represent a large stock of carbon in their upland and peatland soils, including soils with permafrost38. They also represent an important carbon sink driven by the production of roots and mycelia of root-associated fungi forming ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi symbioses39.</p><p>The productivity of boreal forests has been on the rise due to rapidly increasing temperatures and longer growing seasons16; the warming, predicted to be faster than that in other forest biomes in the future40, may also tend to support this trend. However, the decomposition potential of fungal communities in boreal forest soil has also increased due to warming41, and could increase further due to the temperature sensitivity of respiration42. Thus, carbon storage rates are likely to decline in the future.</p><p>Although there is a large gradient in water availability in the boreal zone, drought-induced mortality has been reported in several regions and is predicted to increase further, amplifying the extent, frequency and severity of biotic and abiotic disturbances, including fires16. Forest fires represent an important phenomenon in the boreal zone, with 1% of boreal forest areas burnt annually. The frequency of intense fires that burn much of the organic matter will likely increase because of climate change removing high amounts of carbon, decreasing carbon and nitrogen availability and retarding ecosystem development43. Furthermore, in areas with permafrost, fire exposes frozen organic matter to microbial decomposition, causing positive feedback to global warming44. Fire has multiple effects on the soil microbiome. The lack of nutrients decreases microbial abundance45, including fungal biomass and, consequently, enzyme activity46. The overall diversity of fungi and ectomycorrhizal tree symbionts decreases47, resulting in an increased ericoid mycorrhizal to ectomycorrhizal fungal ratio and the development of soil fungal communities with a high capacity for organic matter decomposition, which may prevent soil carbon sequestration39,48. Compared with fungi, bacterial communities are less affected by forest fires in boreal ecosystems49. Although, for a certain time, specific post-fire microbial communities can develop49,50, the recovery to pre-fire conditions often takes up to several decades44.</p><p>Boreal forests are typically nitrogen-limited51, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition can thus offset the limitations of plant productivity52 and carbon storage53. Nitrogen addition to boreal soils increases the share of bacteria, and available ammonia promotes nitrification, leading to leaching of nitrate and losses of nitrogen oxides through denitrification. High nitrogen content also weakens ectomycorrhizal symbiosis and decreases the share of ectomycorrhizal fungi that liberate nitrogen from soil organic matter51,54. However, the future development of nitrogen deposition in boreal zones is uncertain as even across all the highly populated regions of Sweden, the deposition of nitrogen has decreased in the last decade55. Nitrogen deposition in less populated boreal areas is, nevertheless, of very low intensity56.</p><p>The permafrost thaw in boreal forests substantially changes local hydrology57 and increases the area of inundated land58. As waterlogged soils developing after thaw are an important source of CH4, it is projected that CH4 emissions will increase substantially, although the extent of such an increase is unclear58. In areas where permafrost thawed, the relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungal taxa as well as mycorrhizal plant productivity decreased whereas the relative abundance of putative fungal pathogens increased57, but it is uncertain whether this is a common trend.</p><p>Along with permafrost thaw, warming shifts climatic zones on the forest ecotone, which is the border zone between the forest and non-forest ecosystems. Although treeline shift develops through the establishment of seedlings and their root symbionts, the speed of forest advance is one order of magnitude slower than the speed of warming16. Additionally, in high mountains, the treeline shift to higher elevations lags behind climate warming59, and ectomycorrhizal fungal advance is delayed even further, likely due to dispersal limitation60, setting limits to climate-driven tree expansion. As a consequence, potential forest expansion into so far unforested areas of tundra lags behind warming, which limits the extent of carbon storage that forest expansion may potentially bring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temperate forests</emphasis></p><p>Temperate forests, especially those in North America and Europe, are the subject of intensive research comprising experiments with CO2 enrichment, simulated warming and nitrogen addition that run sufficiently long and allow to understand the effect of global change in these ecosystems at a deeper and more detailed level than in other forest biomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temperate forest microbiomes under climate change</emphasis></p><p>Free-air CO2 enrichment experiments in temperate forests indicate that eCO2 increases the production of fine roots and litter but has a limited effect on carbon storage due to their rapid turnover61,62. Indeed, accelerated microbial turnover of root-derived carbon under elevated CO2 is sufficient in magnitude to offset increased belowground inputs63. Carbon losses are associated with accelerated nitrogen cycling, including nitrification, suggesting that trees exposed to elevated CO2 not only enhance nitrogen availability by stimulating microbial decomposition of soil organic matter via priming but also increase the rate at which nitrogen cycles through microbial pools63,64. Despite accelerated carbon and nitrogen cycling, microbial abundance is not substantially affected by elevated CO2 (ref. 65). CH4 uptake by soil microorganisms is substantially decreased under elevated CO2 (ref. 66). The globally important sink of CH4 in temperate forest soils resulting from the activity of methylotrophic bacteria67 may thus decrease in the future.</p><p>The longest forest warming manipulation has been run in the Harvard Forest for almost 30 years68. The experiment indicated that ecosystem responses changed over time. Rapid carbon loss through respiration was followed by increased degradation of more recalcitrant carbon compounds68. The microbial community underwent reorganization with a shift towards a more diverse, oligotrophic community with decreased abundance of fungi and Actinobacteria, increased abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria69, and potentially higher involvement of bacteria in decomposition70. Long-term warming ultimately results in the depletion of soil organic carbon with corresponding reductions in microbial biomass68. Because temperate forests show weather seasonality, it is expected that warming should increase decomposition in winter months when soils are not drought-limited71.</p><p>This is important as rising global temperatures with limited precipitation increase drought frequency and severity in temperate forests14. Although short droughts have limited effects, persistent water limitation changes the microbial community composition72, increasing the proportion of fungi and filamentous bacteria of the Actinomycetales73 and reducing the abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi74. Furthermore, as many specialized bacteria, including ammonia oxidizers, sulfur oxidizers and CH4 oxidizers, are drought-sensitive75, drought reduces the rates of multiple ecosystem processes. For example, the persistent decline in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as a consequence of drought led to massive reductions in gross nitrification rates and nitrate availability in a mountainous forest, ultimately resulting in reduced nitrogen uptake by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fagus sylvatica</emphasis> seedlings76. Drought can reduce microbial abundance and enzyme activity in litter and soil72,77 and alter fungal community composition in deadwood78, thus decreasing their decomposition. Enhanced carbon storage due to a decrease in decomposition can, however, hardly compensate for the loss of tree net primary production under drought. At a long timescale, sustained pressure of drought and warming promotes the shift of tree species composition, as occurred in the \u2018Mediterranization\u2019 of forests in South Europe79, and may lead to changes in their associated microbiomes.</p><p>As in boreal forests, drought combined with warming will increase the frequency and severity of wildfires in temperate forests50,80. Although decomposition may be slowed down shortly after fire, temperate forests recover to pre-fire states much more rapidly than boreal forests81, reflecting the development of vegetation82,83. Moreover, wildfires leave behind biological legacies, such as fire-adapted fungi, which may promote ecosystem recovery after subsequent fires80,81. Fire frequency increases the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal trees, which are better able to cope with nutrient limitation following fire losses because symbiosis with ectomycorrhizal fungi is more efficient in nitrogen acquisition84. Drought was also a direct or indirect trigger of past outbreaks of insects and pathogens that resulted in millions of hectares of forest defoliation, canopy dieback, declines in forest growth and forest mortality in North America and Europe in recent decades. Not surprisingly, there is positive feedback on fire frequency and severity17,85.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nitrogen deposition effects in temperate forests</emphasis></p><p>Due to the intensity of human activity, nitrogen deposition is particularly pronounced in the temperate zone. In the absence of disturbance, nitrogen deposition enhances the growth of most of the dominant tree species in the United States, potentially leading to increased tree carbon storage86. Across several experiments, simulated nitrogen deposition resulted in soil acidification, accumulation of soil organic matter and changes in its composition, including higher lignin accumulation. Soil carbon accumulation in response to long-term nitrogen enrichment was largely due to the suppression of organic matter decomposition rather than enhanced carbon inputs to soil via litter fall and root production87.</p><p>The response of the bacterial community to simulated nitrogen deposition is moderate compared with that of fungi88. A decrease in the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio was frequently observed87,89,90, but this response was context-dependent. Although fungal biomass and richness increased with simulated nitrogen deposition at sites with low ambient deposition, they were reduced at sites where ambient nitrogen deposition was high91,92. The fungal community undergoes profound restructuring that particularly affects ectomycorrhizal fungi supplying their tree hosts with nitrogen93. A large survey of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with forest trees in Europe shows that, as those ectomycorrhizal fungi that decompose organic matter to obtain nitrogen are associated with low nitrogen deposition, nitrophilic fungi that use inorganic nitrogen are associated with high nitrogen deposition94. Whereas nitrophilic fungi increase under simulated nitrogen deposition92,95, the diversity and mycelial production of ectomycorrhizal fungi both decline as their activity is less important for their tree hosts95,96.</p><p>Decomposition is generally suppressed by nitrogen addition89,97 through the reduction in the activity of extracellular enzymes mediating plant cell wall decay89,98. Not surprisingly, nitrogen addition also shifts the bacterial and archaeal potential for nitrogen fixation, ammonification, denitrification and nitrate reduction as a reflection of increased availability of inorganic nitrogen99. When deposition results in nitrogen saturation of soils, bacterial and archaeal nitrification and denitrification increase and may result in the efflux of nitrogen compounds (nitrate, N2 or nitrous oxide gas) from the ecosystem97,100,101.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Temperate forest adaptation to global change</emphasis></p><p>Climatic factors are already changing the composition of temperate forests. Northwards tree species migration is observed in the United States, although the speed is species-specific102. Because the survival of tree seedlings under modest warming and drought differs widely among tree species103, it is apparent that future forests will be different from the present ones, possibly with higher tree diversity104.</p><p>The present distribution of trees forming arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses is primarily driven by climate and anthropogenic influences, for example nitrogen deposition105. The latter, in concert with warming, have already increased arbuscular mycorrhizal tree dominance during the past three decades in the eastern United States106. Because trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) promote soil microbial communities with higher nitrogen cycling potential and activity relative to those in soils under trees with ectomycorrhizal fungi107, the ongoing shift of ectomycorrhizal to arbuscular mycorrhizal forests will have important functional consequences. The future arbuscular mycorrhiza-dominated forests in the eastern United States will likely show accelerated nutrient turnover with critical consequences for forest productivity, ecosystem carbon and nutrient retention, and feedback to climate change106. Indeed, gene expression studies reveal a 3.5 times greater transcription of nitrogen-cycle genes in arbuscular mycorrhiza-dominated soils than in ectomycorrhiza-dominated soils and a linear increase in volatile reactive nitrogen gases with an increasing share of arbuscular mycorrhizal trees108. Therefore, shifts from ectomycorrhizal to arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species associated with global change have predictable consequences for nitrogen cycling, which include a faster nitrogen turnover in the future and an increase in losses in the volatile form108.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tropical forests</emphasis></p><p>Despite threats of deforestation, degradation and disturbance109 that call for attention, tropical forests are heavily understudied with respect to their response to global change110. The structural complexity, tree species diversity and inaccessibility of tropical forests make experimentation and predictions difficult. Experimental 2-year warming of a soil profile in a Panama rainforest increased CO2 emissions by 55% compared with soil at ambient temperature, which was considerably higher than model predictions. The additional CO2 originated from heterotrophic sources, indicating faster decomposition111. However, considering the complex response of temperate forests to warming, it is unclear what would happen at longer timescales in tropical forests. Because nutrient limitation is widespread in tropical forests112, the potential positive effects of elevated CO2 fertilization are probably limited.</p><p>Drought is probably the major factor affecting tropical forests. Water availability has a strong positive effect on biomass stocks and tree growth, and a predicted increase in drought intensity might, potentially, reduce carbon storage113. The increase in atmospheric water stress driven by climate warming was probably also the main factor responsible for the doubling of tree mortality risk in tropical forests of Australia over the past 35 years114. Prolonged, severe droughts can have profound effects on global carbon storage: it has been speculated that the Amazon drought caused the exceptional increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations in 2005 (ref. 115). The impact of drought on the microbiome of tropical forests is unclear. It was assumed that tropical soils have a low adaptive capacity to perturbations due to lower seasonality, yet the first experiments indicate that the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities in tropical forests are sensitive to small changes in soil water content116. Modest changes in water potential also altered the functional potential and activity of the microbiome. Drought resulted in an increase in hydrolytic enzyme activity and oxidation of complex carbon compounds, such as cellulose, chitin, lignin and pectin116.</p><p>Because of the high tree species diversity, natural tropical forests weakened by drought are likely less vulnerable to insect pests and plant pathogen effects than temperate and boreal forests. Drought waves, however, induce severe fires with multiple consequences30. Current climatic scenarios predict that fire intensity, recurrence and burned area size will all increase in several areas of Brazil. An increase in fire impact is predicted for 97% of the Amazon area117. Moreover, frequent recurrence of fires can create positive feedback as areas that burn repeatedly are more susceptible to new fires. The vegetation in these locations does not recover fully after fires and is not able to restore productivity117, which has consequences for the plant-dependent microbiome.</p><p>The extent of nitrogen deposition is likely of limited importance in most tropical systems56. Although it might locally increase productivity in nitrogen-limited soils, nitrogen deposition would increase phosphorus deficiency in soils where this element is limited, which are more common across the tropics112. Nitrogen additions in the tropics had similar consequences to those in temperate forests, decreasing ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization, changing community composition and reducing the activity of several enzymes118.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microbiome response to global change</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General trends</emphasis></p><p>Although the responses of forests to global change partly reflect specific conditions, some responses of the forest microbiome are general and can act across biomes. One example is the limited effect of eCO2 on microbial communities. Elevated CO2 is likely to have a limited effect because soil CO2 concentrations are normally higher than those in the atmosphere65. Any community changes that occur under elevated CO2, such as the increase in copiotrophic microorganisms and the decrease in oligotrophic microorganisms such as Acidobacteria, reflect elevated rhizodeposition (trafficking of carbon by tree roots into soil)8. Soil respiration generally increases with temperature to a maximum at approximately 25 \u00b0C and decreases at higher temperatures. As no alteration of this pattern due to warming was observed119, ecosystem responses will depend on actual climatic conditions, that is, an increase in cold biomes and a decrease in the tropics.</p><p>The effects of drought are also similar across biomes. Based on a meta-analysis, net primary production, aboveground net primary production, belowground net primary production, total biomass, aboveground biomass, root biomass, gross ecosystem productivity and net ecosystem productivity are all decreased by drought, and the responses are more pronounced with drought intensity and duration. These effects, along with decreased soil moisture and increased soil pH, result in a consistent decrease in soil microbial biomass and an increase in fungal to bacterial biomass ratios24. Fungi are better adapted to drought than bacteria due to their filamentous growth, which gives them the possibility to redistribute water to the actively growing parts of the mycelia75. Additionally, among bacteria, filamentous taxa increase in dry conditions, whereas unicellular, flagellate bacteria are more abundant in wetter conditions and decrease with increasing water deficit73. Drought effects on the bacterial community are consistent: whereas the share of Actinobacteria (including filamentous taxa) and Firmicutes increases, that of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Bacteroidetes decreases8.</p><p>Not surprisingly, global change-driven disturbances of forests tend to reduce microbial abundance in soils due to reduced tree activity, more in the case of abiotic (fire, windthrow) than biotic (insects or pathogenic fungi) disturbances120. Due to the dependence of mycorrhizal fungi on tree roots, disturbances decrease the share of mycorrhizal taxa, overall fungal biomass and the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio in soils121. Although microbial responses to nitrogen deposition reflect soil nitrogen availability, acidification by nitrogen deposition generally increases the share of acidotolerant bacterial phyla such as Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria at the expense of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria8. As in the case of drought, shifts in bacterial community due to nitrogen deposition suggest a change in soil bacterial lifestyle from copiotrophy to oligotrophy, which may affect carbon cycling processes involving bacteria, such as the decomposition of soil organic matter, impacting the forest functioning8.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Species-level responses to global change</emphasis></p><p>Microbial communities are composed of individual taxa, and the ecosystem response can be seen as the sum of species-specific responses. Species are constrained to their realized niches that define the conditions under which they can survive and reproduce in the presence of biotic interactions. The realized niche can be derived from the observed species distribution and abundance across habitat properties, including climatic factors122, offering the possibility to predict the suitability of the present and future conditions for individual microbial taxa.</p><p>According to a global meta-analysis, climate is the main driver of the distribution of individual fungal taxa and the composition of fungal communities123. Climatic niches \u2014 ranges of mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature \u2014 of fungal species differ among fungal guilds. There is considerably less information on the climatic niche space in bacteria, although temperature and moisture content both contribute to shaping bacterial communities124,125. Considering the sensitivity of bacteria to the nitrogen content and pH in soils124, nitrogen deposition is expected to have a profound effect on bacterial community composition. In a laboratory experiment, fungi and bacteria exhibited a wide range of respiration responses to water potential126. Water potential preferences had coarse taxonomic-level signals, suggesting that the moisture niche of soil microorganisms is highly conserved. In particular, strains that were capable of producing biofilms had drier moisture optima and wider niche breadths126.</p><p>As vegetation composition is expected to change in response to global change, its future development will influence microbial communities' composition. The impact is expected to be larger in fungi than in bacteria because of their closer association with plants as hosts or dead plant biomass as a nutrition source127. Although plant host shifts in fungi appear to be a consequence of ongoing global change128, it is unlikely that such shifts will be frequent and rapid.</p><p>If global change factors cause the disappearance of certain microbial taxa, these losses are unlikely to be rapidly compensated by the colonization of adapted microbes60. However, the microbiomes of forest habitats are complex, with a high level of species diversity129 and functional redundancy, where several functions are performed by hundreds of microbial species5. We may speculate that the negative effects of global change on certain taxa may be functionally compensated by the activity of other unaffected community members. Even when global change factors may not cause a clear compositional shift in the active microbial community, they might affect transcription of genes involved in key biochemical processes in these ecosystems130. For example, anthropogenic nitrogen deposition downregulates the expression of fungal genes involved in organic matter decomposition and increases the abundance of bacterial ones, thus altering the interactions between soil and bacteria in charge of degrading organic matter in forest soil131.</p><p>Global change affects not only species distribution and gene expression but also physiology. One example is the increased length of the fruiting season of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in Europe paralleling the extension of the vegetation season, as a consequence of warming. The ectomycorrhizal fruiting season is more constrained, probably due to the necessary cues from the host132. The ecological implications may be diverse, but their effect on ecosystem processes remains yet unclear.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of microbial tree root symbionts and pathogens</emphasis></p><p>Microbial symbionts \u2014 especially tree root-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi and AM \u2014 are essential for forest functioning due to the provision of nutrients to trees as well as the transfer of recently photosynthetically fixed carbon into soil. The global distribution of each of these groups of trees is climatically constrained: ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates in forests where seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition and is predominant at high latitudes and elevations. In contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in unseasonal, warm tropical forests and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm and wet climates enhance decomposition133. As stated above, global warming and nitrogen deposition shift the dominance in favour of arbuscular mycorrhizal trees with consequences for fungal symbioses. Changes in the relative share of ectomycorrhizal fungi and AM then affect bacterial communities. This is because the mycorrhizosphere and mycosphere of ectomycorrhizal fungi have large absorptive areas where fungal hyphae exude labile compounds. This gives these soil compartments distinct features that select for specific bacterial communities134. The lower mycelial stock of AM does not strongly affect bacterial communities8. With the ectomycorrhizal to arbuscular mycorrhizal tree shift, we can thus expect a decrease in the spatial diversity of soil bacterial communities with unclear consequences for ecosystem functioning. From a functional viewpoint, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis will lead to faster nitrogen cycling and potential nitrogen losses108 but may also alleviate phosphorus limitation at higher nitrogen levels due to the specialization of AM in phosphorus acquisition135.</p><p>Global change also affects the species composition within ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal guilds. Importantly, ectomycorrhizal fungal species inhabit narrow ranges of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation with generally lower temperature optima123. With the projection of future warming and reduced precipitation, the ecological constraints of the distribution of these fungi may lead to their relative reduction. Future climate models indeed locally predict a decrease in ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity136. This is in line with the observed decrease in their diversity with increasing mean annual temperature across Japan137. In AM, temperature and pH are the main determinants of niche space122. Acidification, as a result of nitrogen deposition and warming, can thus potentially change arbuscular mycorrhizal communities. Because the carbon to nitrogen ratio and pH are also important drivers of community composition on non-AM123,138, atmospheric nitrogen deposition likely adds further constraints to the stress on fungi under the influence of warming or changed precipitation.</p><p>The realized niche of ectomycorrhizal fungi is significantly narrower than that of fungal plant pathogens, with optima at lower temperatures and intermediate levels of precipitation123. Global warming and droughts may thus disproportionally affect ectomycorrhizal fungi and open a window of opportunity for fungal pathogens. A recent global model of the future distribution of plant pathogens predicts increases in pathogen abundance, with increasing mean annual temperature being its major driver139,140. Forest ecosystem stability might be at risk if trees struggle in recruiting ectomycorrhizal symbionts and are simultaneously challenged by an increase in pathogen abundance. Such an increase in the share of plant pathogens as a response to experimental warming was occasionally observed141, as was the potential effect of climate on fungal pathogen that likely contributed to a decline of a specific tree species142.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions and outlook</emphasis></p><p>Global change will undoubtedly affect the functioning of forest ecosystems, including their microbiomes, in a profound and complex way. Although boreal forests may benefit from higher productivity, they will be threatened by drought, fire and pathogens. Temperate forests are expected to mostly suffer from drought-increased mortality and reflect changes in nitrogen saturation. For tropical forests, the largest challenge will likely be the consequences of droughts (Fig. 4). Forest management will have decisive effects on the health of forest ecosystems and their ability to store carbon. Although natural shifts in tree species composition are a lengthy process, planting tree species suitable for future climate or assisted migration143 may be a rapid alternative applicable in managed forests. As forest trees are long-lived organisms, forest management needs to consider future climatic conditions when establishing future forests. Shifts from monocultures to mixed stands should increase resilience, as observed when comparing monocultures and mixed stands in Central Europe144. The increased resilience may be due to a multitude of factors including the limited response to outbreaks of tree species-specific insects or pathogens, or due to better resource sharing in mixed stands145. There are a wide range of silvicultural measures that come into consideration to mitigate the effects of global change and to promote carbon storage in forest soils (Box 1). The applicability and efficiency of each management type is largely context-dependent, and the evaluation of management outcomes is essential for the development of smart forestry approaches.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effects of global change in boreal, temperate and tropical forest ecosystems.</emphasis></p><p>Climatic factors (reduced precipitation, warming, nitrogen deposition and increase of CO2) have complex direct and indirect effects on environmental conditions, ecosystem processes, vegetation and the microbiome of forests. Whereas certain effects of global change are universal, such as the combination of warming and reduced precipitation inducing drought that itself brings a multitude of consequences. The importance of global change factors varies among forest biomes because climate, tree species diversity (low in boreal forests, high in tropics) and dominant mycorrhizal symbioses differ, the proportion of trees forming arbuscular mycorrhiza increasing from high latitudes to the tropics. Arrows indicate positive effects (red) and negative effects (blue). Although boreal forests may benefit from higher productivity under a warmer climate and higher CO2 concentrations, they will be under danger of drought, fire and pathogens. Temperate forests are expected to mostly suffer from drought-increased mortality and its consequences, and the microbiome will reflect changes in the relative share of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. For tropical forests, the largest challenge will likely be the consequences of droughts. Nitrogen deposition may relieve nitrogen limitation in boreal forests whereas it may induce phosphorus limitation in tropical forests; in the temperate forests, nitrogen deposition may lead to saturation and induce ecosystem-level nutrient losses. AM, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; CH4, methane; eCO2, elevated carbon dioxide concentration.</p><p>The present level of understanding of the future development of forest ecosystems clearly has its limitations. One of the constraints is geographical. There is far less information from tropical ecosystems and their microbiomes. The same is true for forests on permafrost and in other remote areas110,146,147. These gaps in knowledge should be filled by targeted exploration of microbiomes of undersampled locations148.</p><p>Clearly, experimental manipulations such as free-air CO2 enrichment, warming or simulated nitrogen deposition are important sources of information on the potential future trajectories of ecosystem development. Their establishment in underexplored areas is thus an urgent need. Furthermore, the changes in the ecosystem response to manipulation over time make it clear that the running experiments should be maintained across sufficiently long time intervals to cover the whole duration of ecosystem transition. Because global change is an ongoing process, the establishment of a time series of forest microbiome observations is important as trend changes need to be separated from random variation in microbiome composition149.</p><p>Future improvements in understanding tree physiology and in dynamic monitoring are needed to improve the clarity of future predictions of changes in forest composition22. This is tightly linked to the exploration of links between ectomycorrhizal community composition and host tree performance, which allows to assess the effects of reduced diversity or shift to nitrophilic ectomycorrhizal species on forest productivity. Considering ecosystem processes, studies should focus on cycles of nutrients other than carbon \u2014 most obviously nitrogen and phosphorus \u2014 given their potential role as limiting factors of ecosystem productivity. In addition, big data technology will bring new opportunities in analysing the expected increasing volume and complexity of data in climatic research150. The development and application of new technologies such as sensors, satellites and drones and the resolution of remote sensing observation data will allow to detect changes in forest vegetation, to monitor forestry parameters and forest growth, and to improve fire prevention and disease detection151\u2013153.</p><p>Although vegetation and microorganisms make up most of the forest ecosystem biomass, there are other groups of organisms that can significantly affect forest ecosystem functioning, such as invertebrates. The decomposition rates of wood across global forests are significantly affected by insects and their interaction with decomposer fungi154. Interactions with soil animals also affect the performance of fungi155. Research in tropical forests has shown that termites, decomposers that have mutualistic relationships with microbes, can mitigate the effects of drought and accelerate litter decomposition during dry periods156. On the other hand, an experiment in boreal forests found that the activity of invertebrate detritivores decreased when warming and drought were combined, what may also directly affect the decomposition of organic matter by microbial communities due to lower fragmentation of litter157. Incorporation of additional groups of organisms into the models of forest response to global change is thus highly desirable.</p><p>As is apparent throughout this Review, soil is the most critical component of forest ecosystems in terms of microbial processes, and upper layers of soils are the most targeted components of microbiome analyses. Nevertheless, microbiomes of deep soil, which contribute to mineral weathering and carbon immobilization in organo-mineral complexes, as well as microbial communities of other less explored habitats in forest ecosystems should also be assessed. In this sense, as leaf microbiome diversity is positively linked to ecosystem productivity and may mediate drought response in trees, studying how these microbiomes interact with global change will be essential to optimize or maintain primary production in forests8,158,159.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Box 1 Forest management strategies to mitigate the effects of global change</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Promotion of carbon storage through tree species selection</emphasis></p><p>The carbon storage potential of forest soils is tree species-dependent160, and tree species selection is thus one of the possibilities affecting the rate of carbon storage at any certain condition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuous-cover silviculture</emphasis></p><p>The maintenance of forest canopy cover, for example through successive harvesting campaigns as the opposite of clearcutting of whole forest stands, helps conserve carbon stocks and biodiversity and retain the connectivity of ectomycorrhizal networks across the forest life cycle. Because of the latter, seedling establishment is promoted due to availability of root-symbiotic fungi16.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nitrogen fertilization</emphasis></p><p>In nitrogen-limited boreal forests, nitrogen fertilization was demonstrated to increase soil carbon stocks due to increased input of carbon in the form of root-associated mycelium54. The effect of fertilization may, however, be undesirable from a biodiversity perspective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deadwood retention</emphasis></p><p>It is not fully clear how deadwood decomposition contributes to carbon storage161, yet considering the size of the global deadwood pool, this contribution may be significant. Deadwood retention appears to increase both the carbon storage and diversity of the microbiome as well as the diversity of insect communities154.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increase in stress resistance</emphasis></p><p>Controlling stand density at intermediate levels may increase forest resistance to drought by alleviating competition among individuals162. The stress resistance of forest stands may be further increased by selecting tree species tolerant to dieback under stress.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Planting of forests on peatlands</emphasis></p><p>Especially in the boreal zone, peatlands are an important source of methane (CH4) emissions produced by soil anaerobes. CH4 emissions are lowered if forests are planted on peat soils163 as the transpiration of trees lowers the water table level in the peatland and increases the thickness of the soil oxic zone where CH4 is oxidized by methylotrophic microorganisms164.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prescribed burning</emphasis></p><p>To mitigate mega-fires, prescribed burning helps reduce wildfire intensity and, thus, the amount of nutrients that are lost during fires of high intensity, helping conserve the desired functionality of forest ecosystems165.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Restoration of converted lands</emphasis></p><p>Restoration of forests converted to other land use could offset the negative effects of global change. It was recently estimated that restoring 15% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 Gt of carbon dioxide (CO2) (ref. 166).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biodiversity conservation</emphasis></p><p>A recent meta-analysis indicated that biodiversity increased ecosystem functioning in both ambient conditions and under simulated climate change. Positive effects were larger in stressful environments induced by global change drivers, indicating that high-diversity communities were more resistant to environmental change167.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>P.K.

New Covid-19 diagnoses are up in about half of US states over the past week. Hospitalizations are up in 11 states, and deaths have risen in 17 states.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US coronavirus cases have plateaued in recent weeks, holding on to about half of the growth from this summer's latest surge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While new cases have fallen in some states, they're rising in others, particularly some region's cold-weather states.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Southern states that were a large driving force behind this summer's surge now have some of the lowest case rates. Two months ago, Florida and Texas together accounted for nearly a quarter (22%) of all new cases. Now, those two large states account for just 6% of all cases.</p><p>Florida sliced new cases to a 10th of what they were two months ago and Texas to a fifth.</p><p>That should sound like good news. But with less dramatic decreases in other, less populous states -- and slight increases in some others, particularly in the Northeast and Mountain regions -- overall US numbers are holding steady on the whole.</p><p>It's confusing, and the numbers may be sending a mixed message to people. They are not, however, sending a mixed message to epidemiologists, who do not foresee a good winter for the US or for the world.</p><p>Too many people remain unvaccinated, and too many continue to defy and even fight advice to wear masks when indoors with other people. This dangerous combination might mean more surges, even if not as high as in the recent past, and in areas beyond those currently seeing rising cases.</p><p>\"I don't know what's going to happen over the next few weeks. But I have a feeling it's not going to be pretty,\" Michael Osterholm, who heads the center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.</p><p>\"Today is a really sad day,\" epidemiologist Ali Mokdad, who has been tracking the coronavirus pandemic since the beginning at the University of Washington, told CNN. \"Cases are going up. It was coming down. This is at a time when the United States has all the tools we need to prevent a surge, all the tools we need to save lives. We have the best vaccines, and we have plenty of them,\" he said.</p><p>\"And people are not willing to get them.\"</p><p>False sense of security</p><p>Mokdad said states such as Florida have a false sense of security.</p><p>\"Florida has a large population of the elderly, who went and got vaccinated. And the young people simply got infected. So the virus ran out of people to infect,\" he said.</p><p>But he said immunity on both groups is waning.</p><p>\"There will be a lot of winter travel to Florida,\" he said. \"Infections will start all over again,\" he predicted. \"We are so interconnected.\"</p><p>Diagnoses and hospitalizations are both headed upward in Michigan, with hospitalizations up 20% in the past week, according to state data.</p><p>\"Metro Detroit once again is becoming a hotspot,\" Dr. Nick Gilpin, director of infection prevention and epidemiology at Beaumont Health, a health system in southeast Michigan, told a news conference Thursday.</p><p>\"I have a feeling we'll be in this world for the next couple months because I don't see much that can change this unless people start radically changing behavior. This could be a four or five month affair,\" Gilpin added.</p><p>Like Mokdad, Gilpin blames the unvaccinated and a refusal to wear masks. It's hitting hospitals and clinics hard, he said.</p><p>\"I mean, it's brutal. No one wants to see these Covid patients this late. But we're masking up and trying to help people get better,\" Gilpin said.</p><p>\"That said, there's probably no hospital in the state that isn't dealing with staffing shortages. It's difficult, especially as we look to a fourth surge that could last through the winter. This surge is shaping up more to be a marathon than a sprint.\"</p><p>Millions still unvaccinated can fuel new surges</p><p>In Colorado, where cases were up 30% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data, Gov. Jared Polis declared the entire state to be at high risk of Covid-19 transmission or exposure and signed an executive order saying everybody over 18 was eligible for a booster dose of vaccine.</p><p>\"We want to ensure that Coloradans have every tool they need to protect themselves from this deadly virus and to help reduce the stress on our hospitals and health care workers. Every Coloradan is now eligible to get the booster so they can protect themselves and their families,\" Polis said in a statement.</p><p>Mokdad approves. \"Science is telling us we need three doses to be immune,\" he said.  \"We are losing our credibility as scientists unless you say it -- we need three doses to be protected.\"</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have OK'd booster doses for most US adults, and the FDA is considering extending authorization for booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine to all adults.</p><p>Osterholm thinks boosting people will help -- but says it's far more important to get more people vaccinated in the first place.</p><p>\"If we see upticks in L.A. or New York City, we could just as easily find ourselves back to where we were. At this point, there's no evidence of that happening,\" he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/podcasts-webinars/episode-71\">said in his podcast</url> this week.</p><p>\"But I must tell you that given the rates of vaccination ... we surely could see major surges in both of those metropolitan areas where with the population density being what it is, could really, truly raise the number of national cases in short order,\" he added.</p><p>An estimated 60 million Americans remain unvaccinated. That's plenty of people who can help fuel new surges, Osterholm said.</p><p>\"Overall, there's still a lot of human wood left for this coronavirus forest fire to burn,\" he said.</p><p>Even in states, cities and counties with high vaccination rates, enough people remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated to help keep the virus spreading. And if immunity is waning as quickly as some studies indicate it may be, Osterholm fears more breakthrough infections, even among the vaccinated.</p><p>What could be ahead this winter</p><p>Osterholm is pessimistic about the coming weeks. \"That fact, combined with Delta, schools and upcoming holidays, has me skeptical that we won't be seeing new hotspots emerge in this country over the next several weeks and months. So where do I see us going? I think we will continue to see surges. They may not be nearly as high as the ones we've just had, but they will occur.\"</p><p>And they will not be restricted to the current hotspots, Mokdad predicted. The holidays will make sure of that. \"People are moving out and about like there is no Covid-19,\" he said.\"We are going to see Americans traveling -- Thanksgiving and then all the way through New Year. We are going to see a surge, and that surge is going to be very bad.\"</p><p>AAA is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/holiday-travel-2021-forecast-how-to-prepare/index.html\">predicting travel for Thanksgiving</url> will rebound to near pre-pandemic levels, with 53.4 million Americans expected to travel for the holiday -- a 13% increase from last year.</p><p>And plenty of states have such low vaccination levels that they're bonfires waiting to be ignited, Mokdad said.</p><p>\"I mean, West Virginia [is] 41.1% fully vaccinated. So 60% of the population, at least, don't have immunity against infection,\" he said.</p><p>\"So, what do you expect? We're going to have a surge. If you look at Montana, 51%. Wyoming, 44.6%. I mean, you could go on and on. There's so many states right now below 50. Louisiana, 48.1%. Alabama, 45.2%.\"</p><p>These same states, Mokdad and Osterholm both pointed out, have populations largely resistant to mask use, as well.</p><p>\"Nobody is listening,\" Mokdad said morosely. He said he and fellow epidemiologists were discussing how they could bring attention to the dire situation.</p><p>\"Some of us we were talking about going on a hunger strike. We are really frustrated. It's depressing that we know how protect our population and we are not doing it,\" he said.         </p><p>             Alexander Harring and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this story         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He said the situation was stabilising, with 100120 new cases identified every day. The restrictions are minimal, he said. The coronavirus challenge has led to a noticeable build-up of the regional healthcare system. Some 1.3 million people will be vaccinated by the autumn. Over 100 vaccination centres are open in the territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As for the economy, the Governor said that consumer-oriented sectors were hit the hardest. Some experts expected a 25 percent decrease in budget revenue, but the region closed the year with a small surplus, in particular thanks to the assistance of the Finance Ministry, most of which was invested in countering the pandemic, and thanks to a restrained spending policy.</p><p>Alexander Uss noted a major increase in investment last year. A comprehensive investment project, Yenisei Siberia, is gathering momentum, and several more projects have been launched in the region, including gold mill #5 of the Polyus gold producer and the Syradasay coal deposit on Taimyr in the Arctic. The construction of the Vysokogorsky bridge towards rich deposits on the right bank of the Yenisei began a year ahead of schedule. There are grounds to believe that this strategically important bridge will be commissioned in 2023. Rosneft's Vostok Oil project to develop the world's largest oil and gas province will create the basis for the head-on growth of the region's economy, because it will also involve other enterprises in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. The project provides for cooperation in such areas as services, mechanical engineering and education. This can turn Krasnoyarsk into a major investment hub.</p><p>The Governor mentioned three vital sectors for the region.</p><p>The first sector is agriculture. Last year, local farms gathered in the largest ever grain harvest in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. Grain export increased to 178 percent, a new grain processing factory will be built to produce gluten and biodegradable plastic for export.</p><p>The second sector is forestry. The region has set the path towards decriminalisation of the forestry sector, including by increasing the number of inspectors. Despite the pandemic restrictions, nearly all felling sites have been inspected. The area of wild fires has decreased fivefold. Alexander Uss thanked the President for supporting the idea of creating the northern forest fire centre. A total of 5 billion rubles has been allocated for the centre, which has received 120 pieces of equipment and six helicopters. There was a 30 percent increase in forest recreation. The local authorities want to create a reforestation nursery not only for the Krasnoyarsk Territory, but also for entire Siberia. Timber cutting has decreased slightly, by 11.5 percent, which does not exceed the margin of sampling error. But timber production sawn timber, plywood and frame house construction increased by 612 percent during that difficult year.</p><p>Transport is the third sector. In a highly significant event, the two largest passenger liners that can accommodate 240 people each have been laid down for the Yenisei River at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard. They are precisely for passengers, rather than purely for tourists. The Governor expressed hope that the President would be able to sail the Yenisei River aboard such a ship in 2023. Regarding aviation, a new airport taxiway is 90 percent complete, and light/signalling equipment remains to be installed. The new taxiway will boost the number of aircraft that can take off and land by 100 percent. This is essential as Aeroflot, in the context of the Presidential instruction, views Krasnoyarsk as its second hub. Moreover, Volga-Dnepr, the largest cargo airline, also works out of Krasnoyarsk. The company has already expanded freight traffic volumes 2.5-fold and has created a so-called sterile airport as a certain cargo delivery pre-condition. There are plans to complete the creation of a regional airline. Kras Avia has purchased two modern ATR-42 aircraft and is setting up a consortium together with NordStar Co. In all, seven modern aircraft will be available. The metro is a separate subject. The project that has received an additional one billion rubles, with the President's support, is now complete, and experts are analysing its first stage.</p><p>The Governor voiced two requests concerning the airport and the metro. He said that, considering the high status of these projects which exceed the Krasnoyarsk Territory's scale, Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin should assess their prospects in great detail. After that, it will become possible to discuss their funding.</p><p>Vladimir Putin noted that the expansion of the aviation hub was absolutely natural, all the more so since Krasnoyarsk is the central element of intersecting routes. Of course, the subject of the metro also has to be discussed.</p><p>The President also drew attention to the problems with sunken wood that can damage new passenger ships on the Yenisei River between the Krasnoyarsk and Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric power plants. Mr Uss explained that this was a short, 350-kilometre navigation sector, the so-called Krasnoyarsk Sea. Although they are cleaning it up regularly, sunken wood remains a serious problem. Consequently ships with special protective systems sail there. The new motor ships, mentioned by the Governor, will sail downstream from Krasnoyarsk. This year, despite the pandemic, Vodokhod Co. has taken its chances and upgraded MS Maxim Gorky, with the support of the regional administration. The cruise liner has sailed due north towards the Arctic Ocean 13 times for the first time in 20 years. The new ships will sail precisely in this direction.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124449686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62N7-3151-JCBF-S0T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 11, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It was the latest update on U.S. Forest Service's Incident Information website, <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7208\"/>, as of press time Thursday night.</p><p>The update stated, \"Priority action is taking place in Albany, Centennial and Ryan Park subdivision with specifically designated structure protection groups.\"</p><p>A total of 1,079 personnel were working the fire, managed by a Southern Area Type 1 Blue Team. The incident website also started providing a daily fact sheet format Thursday, which provides concise information on firefighting efforts and spread of the Mullen Fire.</p><p>The following are some of those notes that were provided at 11 a.m. Thursday:</p><p>Fire crews assessed need and ordered supplies for structure protection in the Ryan Park and Centennial areas in the event the fire moves closer.</p><p>The fire has worked its way around Albany. Firefighters focused on suppression efforts in the transition between timber and grasslands along the old railroad line between Albany and Centennial. Fixed-wing aircraft helped to fortify that line when clear air allowed.</p><p>Grazing lands between Albany and Sheep Mountain provided a fuel break for firefighters, assisted by aircraft and retardant to limit fire spread to the east.</p><p>A burnout was conducted Wednesday to secure the area about four miles north of A Bar A ranch in the fire's northwest section.</p><p>The north perimeter of the fire is resistant to containment due to heavy concentrations of dead and downed fuels. The fire was held in the Rambler area along Wyoming Highway 338. Structure protection efforts there and around Keystone were successful, with helicopters assisting with water drops.</p><p>Firefighters worked to cool the heat in the finger burning west of Woods Landing.</p><p>Structure protection efforts were successful in the Foxborough, Fox Park and Mountain Home areas, although there was more heat in the area.</p><p>A large portion of the Mullen Fire continues to burn in beetle-killed lodgepole pine trees with heavy dead and downed fuels.</p><p>The update stated the weather conditions will continue to deteriorate with respect to firefighting efforts for the next several days, with continued critically low relative humidity, well above-average temperatures, and winds picking up, with gusts of 25-30 mph.</p><p>Mandatory evacuations are still in place for the communities of Rambler, Albany, Fox Park, Wold, Woods Landing, Graham and adjacent areas, Lower Keystone and Moore's Gulch. Pre-evacuation orders are still in place for Meadow Plains Road south to Yankee Road; areas near Sheep Mountain to Lake Hattie Reservoir and north of Highway 230; and Centennial.</p><p>For current information on the multiple evacuations and pre-evacuations, visit the following websites:</p><p>Albany County Sheriff Office (WY) Facebook page: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/Albany-County-Sheriffs-Office-618424944997540\"/></p><p>Jackson County Sheriff's Office (CO) Facebook page: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/JacksonCountySheriffOffice\"/></p><p>Larimer County (CO) website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.larimer.org/emergency/emergency-information\"/></p><p>Road status can also change quickly change in response to fire conditions.

UdeM researcher Erick Lachapelle investigates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When a forest fire rages or a flood hits, many people these days tend to put the blame squarely on climate change. But many others do not, even when the extreme weather affects them personally. And that's something a Canada-U.S. team of researchers is trying to understand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Led by Universite de Montreal political scientist Erick Lachapelle, with colleagues at Yale University, University of California - Santa Barbara and Utah State University, the team developed an interactive map that charts Canadian public opinion on climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Freely available for download, the modeling resurfaced this month as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland for the United Nations COP26 climate talks, vowing to end deforestation and stop funding fossil-fuel projects.</p><p>We asked Lachapelle to discuss his team's research in light of the conference and recent climate events and in anticipation of the updating in January of the current map, which dates from 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Why do you think a lot of people in places like Canada's \"oil patch\" or the American Midwest, who have experienced terrible natural disasters like fires and floods, are still reluctant to acknowledge climate change?</p><p>Researchers are only beginning to unpack the links between experience with climate-change impacts and climate-change beliefs. The best available evidence suggests that these impacts are short-lived and modest. In a study of the impacts of extreme weather on climate change opinion in the U.S., for instance, researchers found that there is indeed an association between exposure to these events and concerns about climate change, but only with relatively recent experience with extreme weather. Extreme weather occurring more than three months out tends to have little bearing on the evolution of climate-change opinions. Moreover, these effects are modest compared to the effects of other things that mold public-opinion - like values, ideology and political identities - which trump the effects of weather. And they can vary heavily whether a person is more of a political liberal or a political conservative.</p><p>So it's not a question of being ignorant of the facts, or of willfully ignoring them, but rather of the facts getting in the way of a strongly held opinion?</p><p>In fact, much evidence suggests that people interpret their experience with extreme weather in ways that fit their pre-existing beliefs and values, such that people who are predisposed to reject climate change (because it does not fit their values, identity, or ideology) are less likely to perceive or accurately remember extreme weather events in their local area. This phenomena of \"motivated reasoning\" or more specifically \"biased assimilation\" is commonly found in studies of public-opinion formation, and suggests that people selectively interpret new information in ways that fit and do not challenge their pre-existing attitudes, beliefs and world views. In light of all of this, it might not be so surprising to learn that, even in the aftermath of extreme wildfires happening a few years ago, political conservatives living in the oil patch might not be so moved by extreme weather events. Their values motivate them to be skeptical about attempts to attribute the fires to climate change.</p><p>At base, what makes people with more conservative values and identities so skeptical about climate change?</p><p>First, it's because climate change threatens their values of freedom and autonomy, and their preferences for small government. Climate change demands more government regulation and changes to our lifestyles, something political conservatives do not necessarily like. It also provides these groups with a political weapon they can use to demonize their opponents for proposing policies intended to change the status quo. The second reason is that climate change threatens their identity. For years, conservative elites - from politicians to media barons to oil executives- have downplayed the risks of climate change. In some places siuch as the U.S. climate change has joined the ranks of other issues like abortion and gun control as a conservative identity marker. Group membership can affect how people interpret new information, as we tend to adopt a position that is consistent with our perceived \"in-group\" while actively resisting information coming from \"out-group\" sources, who are generally seen as less credible and trustworthy. To the extent that people identify with conservative elites, they are motivated to adopt a similar stance toward climate change, or else risk the in-group status and self-esteem derived from their standing in the group.</p><p>What do you think is lacking currently in terms of the political messaging around climate change?</p><p>Lots. But a key thing is messengers. Right now, most of the people speaking for climate change in the country are ecologists and youth. Their discourse is portrayed as a left-wing narrative. This does not speak to all Canadians. Because of the reasons given above, out-group messages will fall on deaf ears, or worse, polarize the public. What is missing are prominent voices from different segments of society: if working mothers in suburban Canada, farmers and ranchers in rural Canada, and conservative politicians in general, were to acknowledge and communicate the climate-change emergency, we would go a long way in terms of reducing polarization and one of the major barriers to climate action.</p><p>Is the fact of a rural-urban divide behind a lot of the skepticism?</p><p>It's no secret that rural areas are more conservative. So having prominent voices in rural communities - people like themselves - raising awareness and concern about climate change is also missing. Rural areas also have considerable structural barriers preventing them from engaging in the types of behaviours commonly asked of Canadians in the fight against climate change: \"drive less\" and \"take public transit\" are a lot more difficult in rural settings. So these kinds of messages when heard in rural parts of the country don't work. But, rural areas are more pro-environmental in other ways. They are more likely to grow their own food; make, mend, repair or re-use goods rather than buying new; buy local: these are all pro-environmental behaviours you commonly see in rural areas. Speaking to this, reminding rural dwellers that they are already pro-environment before asking them to do something about climate change, would go a long way in activating latent pro-environmental values. It's better than guilt-tripping them for not driving a fancy new electric car - that only serves to polarize them further.</p><p>Did the recent federal election reveal anything that suggest a better way to bring about a consensus on climate change?</p><p>Yes. (Conservative Party leader) Erin O'Toole got the message. He can't win on what's seen as an anti-environmental platform. He went against some grassroots in his party and came out with a message that climate change is real and is caused by humans. He dropped the fight over carbon pricing and came up with his own plan to put a price on carbon. Conservative voices coming around to acknowledge and address the ultimate existential threat facing humans and living things on our planet is the single biggest thing we need to build a consensus on climate change. That's what happened in in Quebec (and to a lesser extent in places like the U.K.). There is an inter-party consensus on the reality of climate change and the urgent need for action. But there are still many conservative politicians across the country and in provincial positions of power who are not singing the same tune as O'Toole. Making climate change a wedge issue, as in the U.S. or as the ex-Tory politician Maxime Bernier and others have tried to do in some provinces like Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta, is definitively not the way forward. Pro-climate action conservatives need to be given more sustained prominence if we are to reduce polarization around climate action and reach a consensus on climate action in this country.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7662919 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7662919</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6429-CC31-DYG2-R2P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1397\"/><timeReceived>7:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 11, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But with more than 850,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., that's not enough. A new software tool called Sara Alert, developed by a federally funded nonprofit, aims to solve that arduous data-management problem.</p><p>\"The concept here is quickly find the brush fire and extinguish the brush fire before you have a forest fire,\" said Paul Jarris, chief medical adviser at Mitre Corp., the research group that developed the software.</p><p>Social distancing is a blunt tool that can suppress transmission, but it comes at great cost. As new cases decline and states attempt to reopen, it will be up to public health departments to identify people infected with the virus, find out whether they've exposed others, and, if so, quarantine and monitor those contacts. If more people get sick, they repeat the process, chasing down the virus case by case to break chains of transmission.</p><p>Officials in a handful of places including Arkansas started using Sara Alert in April. Health workers enroll people exposed to the virus who are asked to quarantine for 14 days. Those who need monitoring choose how they'd like to be contacted: by text message, phone, or email prompts that lead to an online survey.</p><p>Sara Alert asks them to respond to automated queries daily. If people report symptoms, their records are flagged to health workers for follow-up, and they can be referred for testing or medical care. People who don't respond also get flagged.</p><p>People who develop no symptoms in the 14-day incubation window are notified that their quarantine is over, with no need for intervention from a human health worker. Jarris calls it \"a force multiplier for public health.\"</p><p>Jarris, a 62-year-old family physician and former commissioner of Vermont's health department, said the name and design of the user interface are meant to be reassuring. \"We did not want a name that sounded like big government,\" he said.</p><p>The new coronavirus has revealed a glaring weakness in the U.S. health care system. Even with gleaming flagship hospitals and advanced biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, the nation was unprepared for the shoe-leather work of human tracing necessary to contain an outbreak of this magnitude.</p><p>\"The basic infrastructure for our public health system in the U.S. really needs to be built up,\" said Judy Monroe, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who now leads the CDC Foundation. The philanthropic group supported some of the work on Sara Alert.</p><p>The country needs about 100,000 contact tracers to respond to COVID-19, by one estimate from Johns Hopkins University researchers. The total existing workforce in state and local public health departments is roughly 225,000.</p><p>\"Our workforce in public health for contact tracing before COVID-19 was adequate for what we had, but it's not adequate for COVID-19,\" said Jennifer Dillaha, state epidemiologist and medical director for immunizations at the Arkansas Department of Public Health.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-9719578</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS8-KSR1-JCM7-R1X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0001TFD</classCode><className>MITRE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC8748 BUSINESS CONSULTING SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120GC</classCode><className>COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DP79</classCode><className>DISEASE CONTACT TRACING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Although bottom-up inventories provide historical Black Carbon emission estimates that are widely used in Earth System Models, they are poorly constrained by observations prior to the late 20th century. Here we use an objective inversion technique based on detailed atmospheric transport and deposition modeling to reconstruct 1850 to 2000 emissions from thirteen Northern Hemisphere ice-core records. We find substantial discrepancies between reconstructed Black Carbon emissions and existing bottom-up inventories which do not fully capture the complex spatial-temporal emission patterns. Our findings imply changes to existing historical Black Carbon radiative forcing estimates are necessary, with potential implications for observation-constrained climate sensitivity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Black Carbon is an important climate forcer with poorly constraint historic emission fluxes and therefore large emission uncertainty. Here, ice-core data are combined with modelling to reconstruct historical emissions of Black carbon and finding gaps with the existing inventories, which implies potential climate sensitivity biases</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Black carbon (BC) is a fraction of carbonaceous aerosol that has a strong positive radiative forcing and can result in severe health impacts at high concentrations. BC is considered to be among the most important climate forcers at the global scale together with carbon dioxide and methane1,2, with a present warming contribution estimated to be 0.1 degree relative to pre-industrial times, according to the recent Sixth Assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change3. Its climate effect is amplified when BC is deposited in snow- and ice-covered areas resulting in decreased albedo and increased snow melt3\u20136. Because of its relatively short atmospheric lifetime (days to weeks), BC is heterogeneously distributed in the atmosphere so the lack of global observations capable of capturing this heterogeneity means that modelling is crucial to assess atmospheric concentrations. The potential for climate change mitigation through BC emissions reductions has been recognized. For the development of successful mitigation strategies accurate historical BC emissions are crucial. However, many bottom-up emission inventories are poorly constrained by observations1.</p><p>Global BC emissions are highly variable and depend on regional emission sources and policies. South Asia currently suffers the world\u2019s highest BC pollution levels, which not only perturb Earth\u2019s radiative balance, but also threaten human health by causing premature mortality7. Conversely, BC pollution in North America and Europe has been decreasing in the last decades8,9. These emission changes are directly linked via long-range atmospheric transport to BC concentrations and deposition rates in the Arctic. Several Arctic air monitoring stations that have been operating since 198910 show decreasing atmospheric BC trends during recent years11,12.</p><p>Long-term constraints on past BC emissions beyond the atmospheric monitoring era can be reconstructed from natural archives incorporated in lake sediments and glacier ice. While lake sediments are important archives of BC deposition since they are distributed throughout terrestrial regions, interpretation is hampered by low resolution, generally high dating uncertainties, and difficulties in quantitatively relating sediment records to atmospheric concentrations and emissions, in part because BC transport to lake sediment sites can be both aeolian and fluvial13,14. Contrary to sediment records, ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet and smaller mid- and high-latitude mountain glaciers and ice caps provide direct, well-resolved, and well-dated records of solely atmospherically deposited BC. Similar to recent studies quantifying ancient, Medieval, and modern atmospheric lead15 and other pollutant emissions16, ice-core records provide robust constraints on past BC emissions15,17,18.</p><p>The first high-resolution ice-core record of BC concentrations19 was collected from west-central Greenland covering the period 1790\u20132005. It showed a large influence of BC from boreal forest fires before 1890 (hereafter referred to as biomass burning (BB) BC), and that anthropogenic BC contribution peaked in the 1920s before decreasing during the last few decades of the 20th century. Since this record was published, several other ice cores have been developed from Greenland20\u201325, Arctic Canada26, Svalbard27,28, the continental United States29, Russia30, the European Alps31,32 South America33 the Antarctic17,34,35, the Himalayas36 and the Tibetan Plateau37. These records show high interannual variability in large part because of year-to-year variability in transport and seasonal snow deposition at the coring sites, but robust multi-annual trends related to historical changes in regional emissions are clear.</p><p>Interpretation of some of these records has been underpinned by detailed atmospheric transport and deposition modeling17,35. Bauer et al., 201325 reported underestimation of modelled BC deposition for Greenland at the beginning of the 20th century and overestimation toward the end of the century. Comparisons of simulated BC deposition in aerosol transport models38,39 with snow/ice observations revealed biases likely related to deficiencies in the underlying emission inventories. In the Arctic, significant uncertainties in historical emission inventories are related to inaccuracies in the spatial representation and high variability in emission estimates for individual source sectors2. High uncertainties in BC emissions are directly propagated to modelled atmospheric transport and deposition, and consequently to climate impact assessments of BC1. Therefore, more accurate quantification of BC emissions is fundamental for climate modelling. It is crucial to provide independent constraints on BC emissions, especially for historical emissions that are associated with the largest uncertainties because of a lack of observations. Here we use a formal inversion technique to quantitatively constrain the emissions in several broad regions based on a large array of ice-core BC records. While earlier studies have used individual ice cores to discuss implications for historical emissions25, here we make use of an array of thirteen BC ice-core records collected from mid- to high-latitude Northern Hemispheric sites to constrain historical BC emissions since the late 19th century Industrial Revolution. BC deposition records were collected from Greenland, Arctic Canada, Russia, Svalbard, and mid- latitude glaciers in the European Alps and the Caucasus (supplementary Table S1). All the ice cores, except the Holtedahlfonna record, were analyzed using the single-particle soot-photometer method19 so BC concentrations should be closely comparable, although there were differences in sample handling (e.g., continuous versus discrete sample measurements40 that may have affected some of the records. Temporal resolutions vary from sub-annual (Greenland) to sub-decadal (e.g., Canada); hence, we here focus on trends in decadal-scale deposition so the effects of any dating uncertainties, sampling resolutions, or post-depositional processes should be relatively small18. The unprecedented size and geographic breadth of this ice-core array allows for exceptional robustness in the inferred BC emissions since BC deposition trends recorded in multiple ice cores likely reflect changes at regional to continental scales.</p><p>For each ice-core site we calculated monthly footprint emission sensitivities (FES) that allow quantification of the impact of emissions on the BC deposition at the receptor. FES is the probability that emissions occurring at any grid cell lead to deposition at the receptor. Thus, FES can be high even in regions where there are no BC emissions.</p><p>We used meteorological re-analysis data for the 20th century (Methods) for the calculations of the FES and extended our calculations back to 1850 assuming that dynamics of atmospheric transport and deposition in the 19th century were the same as in the 20th. Similar calculations have been performed to investigate historical deposition of lead in Greenland41 and BC in Antarctica17. Finally, the modelled FES together with the thirteen ice core observations of BC were used in an inversion framework to quantitatively constrain emissions in several broad regions (Methods).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source regions for the ice core locations</emphasis></p><p>Results show that the northern Greenland high-altitude ice-core sites (Fig. 1a) have lower FES values overall and particularly in the Arctic, reflecting the fact that air arrives at these high-altitude sites (\u22652000 m a.s.l.) via the free troposphere and has less surface contact than air arriving at lower-altitude sites. Southern Greenland ice core sites (Fig. 1b) are sensitive to BC emissions in North America but also in the UK and Scandinavia. The low-altitude Flade Isblink site in northeastern Greenland (Fig. 1d), Devon ice cap in Canada, and the three sites in the European Arctic (Fig. 1c) are more sensitive to emissions in Eurasia than to North America. In particular, the Akademii Nauk and Svalbard (Fig. 1c) ice core sites are highly sensitive to emissions in Russia and Northern Europe. The Colle Gnifetti (Fig. 1f) and Mt. Elbrus sites (Fig. 1g) are mostly sensitive to emissions in Western and Central Europe, and Eastern Europe and Russia, respectively. These results show that the different ice cores receive BC emitted from different source areas, but also that their FES overlap, implying that no ice core record is uniquely representative of BC emissions from only one region. However, collectively they provide regional emission information that can be extracted from the joint record.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sensitivity of black carbon deposition at Northern Hemisphere ice core sites to source region emissions.</emphasis></p><p>The footprint emission sensitivity (FES) in a grid cell is the simulated black carbon deposition (mg BC m\u22122 month\u22121) at the ice core site that a potential emission source of unit strength (1 kg s\u22121) in that grid cell would produce57. It combines wet and dry black carbon deposition, and accounts for black carbon source emissions below 100 m a.g.l., averaged over 100 years. The ice core sites are marked with white dots. For ice core sites close to each other, FES values are averaged. We combine ice cores in the region of northern Greenland (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> - Summit, Tunu, NEEM, Humboldt), southern Greenland (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> - ACT2, D4), three sites in the Eurasian Arctic (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> - Holtedahlfonna, Lomonosovfonna and Akademii Nauk), and show separately a low-altitude Greenland site (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> - Flade Isblink), one in the Canadian Arctic (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> - Devon), and in the mid-latitudes Colle Gnifetti in the Alps (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) and Mt. Elbrus in the Caucasus (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>). Notice that emission sensitivity maps are combined here for display purposes only but are treated separately in the analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modelled and observed black carbon deposition fluxes</emphasis></p><p>By combining the FES (Fig. 1) with different emission inventories we obtained modeled BC deposition fluxes at the ice core sites. We did this separately for two BC emission inventories used for the 5th and 6th climate model inter comparison projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6; Fig. S1), which can be directly compared to observations. However, to avoid biases (details below) when performing the inversion, we scaled the modelled concentration to the observations; the original/unscaled values can be found in the supplement in Fig. S3. Mean observed BC deposition fluxes (Fig. 2) at the various ice-core sites over the period 1850\u20132000 span an order of magnitude, with the lowest values at high altitude Greenland sites and Devon (0.2\u20130.3 mg m\u22122 year) and the highest values at Mt. Elbrus (4.2 mg m\u22122 year) and Holtedahlfonna, Svalbard (12.3 mg m\u22122 year). However, the higher flux at Holtedahlfonna is most likely due to a different BC quantification method used at this site, which is known to produce higher concentrations (Supplementary Data Table S1), and local contamination from Svalbard coal mines has been ruled out by several previous studies27,42. Generally, these observed differences in BC deposition fluxes between the different ice cores of about one order of magnitude are reflected well in the modeled fluxes which span from 0.9 mg m\u22122 year for Tunu to 7.0 mg m\u22122 year for Mt. Elbrus when using CMIP5 emissions and 0.6 mg m\u22122 year to 4.1 mg m\u22122 year with CMIP6 emissions (Fig. S3), although substantial biases exist at individual sites.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of measured and modeled black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes for the thirteen ice cores.</emphasis></p><p>Observed (decadal) mean annual black carbon deposition fluxes (gray) at all sites except for Holtedahlfonna, for which elemental carbon (EC) deposition is given with a sampling resolution of ca. 2\u20135 years. The a priori modeled values were obtained by using the biomass burning emissions and the black carbon inventories for CMIP5 (light blue) and CMIP6 (dark blue), combined with monthly emission sensitivities and scaled to the measured fluxes of the latest available decade. Modeled BC deposition fluxes using <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> emissions from the inversion are shown with black lines. Notice that the ordinate scales are different in each panel.</p><p>In most Greenland ice-core records observed BC deposition peaks around 1910 and then decreases toward 2000 (Fig. 2). At ACT2, D4 and Summit, post-1950 fluxes are about 25% of early 20th century values, with no prominent later increases. The timing of the early 20th century BC deposition maximum in Greenland ice cores is much better captured by our model when using CMIP5 rather than CMIP6 emissions, suggesting that early 20th century BC emissions from North America are incorrectly represented in the CMIP6 inventory. In contrast to Greenland, the Akademii Nauk and Holtedahlfonna ice cores (Eurasian Arctic) and the Mt Elbrus core show rising BC deposition in the late 20th century, peaking in the 1970s on Mt Elbrus and the 1980s at Akademii Nauk and Holtedahlfonna. This is consistent with continuous increases in continental BC emissions at lower latitudes in Russia and Central, East and South (CES) Asia, documented in both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 inventories, and which only ended in the 1980s (Fig. S1). Increasing BC deposition through the late 20th century is also documented in lake sediments from north-western Arctic Russia. This was attributed in part to growing BC emissions from natural gas flaring in the mainland Russian Arctic14 which is an important source region for Akademii Nauk and Holtedahlfonna (Fig. 1). Greenland ice core records (ACT2, Summit, D4 and Tunu) have comparatively low BC deposition fluxes in the late 20th century, suggesting that the 1980s maximum in the Akademii Nauk and Holtedahlfonna ice cores is mostly due to BC emissions from the former Soviet Union, which dropped in the 1980s because of the economic collapse and political disintegration. The temporal evolution of BC emissions in the former Soviet Union is likely better represented in the CMIP6 than the CMIP5 inventories, since there is a better agreement between the modeled and measured BC deposition fluxes in the second half of the 20th century at Akademii Nauk, Holtedahlfonna and Mt. Elbrus (Fig. 2) when using the CMIP6 data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inversion results</emphasis></p><p>The fact that different ice-core sites are sensitive to BC emissions from different source regions (Fig. 1) provides an opportunity to use inverse modelling for constraining historical emissions with the ice-core records. This approach requires the use of so-called a priori emissions, for which we use the average of CMIP5 and CMIP6 inventories, combined with BC emission data from biomass burning (BB43; for emission variation see supplementary data Fig. S1). We then applied a Bayesian inversion algorithm (Methods) to the decadally-averaged ice-core records of BC deposition from 1850 to 2000 to determine optimized <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> BC emissions in four source regions (North America, Europe, Russia and the CES Asia; Fig. 3d, inset). A potential problem with this approach is that model biases or inaccuracies in the ice-core records (e.g., age model, post-depositional snow scouring by wind or melt water percolation) can be imprinted on the emissions retrieved by the inversion. To bypass this problem, we scaled the modeled BC deposition fluxes for each ice core to the observed values of the last decade (Supplementary Data Fig. S2), on the assumption that the a priori <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">emissions</emphasis> are most reliable during that period, and that model and observational biases and the representativity of the sites did not change with time. This emphasizes temporal variability and removes uncertainties associated with absolute BC concentrations measured using different methods. Sensitivity studies without scaling the model results to observations, show that European emissions are unrealistically low, while the other emissions are unaffected (Supplementary Data Fig. S9).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Black carbon emission history obtained from the inversion.</emphasis></p><p>A priori (thick black line) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> (shaded areas) emissions north of 30 \u00b0N for the different regions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>). CMIP5 and CMIP6 emissions (both including the same biomass burning emissions) are shown with dark and light gray lines, respectively. The regions for which the emissions are optimized are shown as an inset in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) and reflect the colors used in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>).</p><p>The largest change between a priori (inventory-based) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> (updated after the inversion) BC emissions is an increase of the emissions in North America from 1880 to 1920 (Fig. 3a). Inverse modelling suggests that BC emissions there peaked higher and earlier (in the 1900s) than reported in CMIP emission inventories. Following this peak, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> emissions drop rapidly to a minimum during the Great Depression of the 1930s44 when they reach about one third of their 1900s maximum. This rapid drop in emissions is also absent in the CMIP inventories. Modeled emissions in the second half of the 20th century are more consistent with the inventories. Sensitivity tests showed that the results obtained for North America are robust against changes in the inversion setup (Supplementary Data Figs. S9 and S10).</p><p>For Europe, the inversion decreases the a priori emissions over the whole period, with the exception of the late 20th century, when the emissions are nearly unchanged (Fig. 3b). The largest difference is that the a priori emissions start to decrease in the early 1970s, whereas the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> emissions remain stable until the late 1980s, and then decline. For Russia, the modeled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> emissions are substantially lower than those in the CMIP inventories from about 1900 to 1950 (Fig. 3c). The largest difference is in the 1910s, when posterior emissions are up to 65% lower. It seems plausible that Russian BC emissions decreased during this time, a consequence of the turmoils of the October Revolution and World War I, which caused the economy to collapse45,46. The early 20th century drop in a posteriori Russian BC emissions is entirely absent in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 emission inventories, which show a continuous increase of BC emissions in Russia, with little variability. Before 1900 and after 1950, a priori and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> BC emissions are essentially identical, and clearly show the steep decline in Russian BC emissions during the 1980s.</p><p>For CES Asia, a priori and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a posteriori</emphasis> BC emissions are nearly the same (Fig. 3d). This is likely a result of the limited sensitivity of BC deposition at our 13 ice-core sites to emissions from this region. This limitation could be overcome in the future by including ice-core records of BC from central/northern Asia in the inversion.</p><p>Our results, which are based on an exceptionally robust and geographically representative ice core BC deposition dataset, should be implemented to improve used emission inventory data. We were able to define amendments required to emission inventories in specific areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings have implications for estimates of global and regional radiative forcing caused by BC emissions in the last 150 years. Specifically, early 20th century BC emissions in Europe and Russia are overestimated by the existing emission inventories, whereas BC emissions in North America are underestimated. For North America, our modeled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">posterior</emphasis> emissions are about a factor two higher than the CMIP6 emissions for the period 1850\u20131920, and nearly a factor three higher in the 1900s. It is thus likely that climate models using the CMIP inventories strongly underestimate the BC radiative forcing in the western hemisphere but strongly overestimate it in the eastern hemisphere, possibly affecting global circulation. These discrepancies would affect simulated surface temperatures and thus also constraints on simulated climate sensitivity47, with consequent implications for projections of future warming. Thus, future efforts should be directed to further refining existing BC emissions inventories for the early 20th century to increase the reliability of climate models. Increased emissions in the early 20th century might also have impacted melting of Arctic ice due to albedo changes. Since our inversions suggest similar emissions during the Industrial Revolution and in the recent past, a higher melting rate seems possible compared to what climate models currently assume.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>BC is a highly variable mixture of carbonaceous compounds with five underlying physical properties relating to its microstructure, morphology, thermal stability, solubility and light absorption48. Currently, there is no single instrument that can measure all properties simultaneously and no unique, standard method has been developed for BC quantification. All but one of the 13 ice core records used in this study were developed using the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP249), which is sensitive to refractory, sub-micron-diameter BC particles (refractory BC, or rBC). In short, ice meltwater samples are aerosolized using a nebulizer and introduced to the SP2, which measures individual BC particles using laser-induced incandescence to obtain a mass concentration. This approach can be used for both continuous ice core analysis19,17 or for discrete meltwater samples28. The Holtedahlfonna ice core used in this study was analyzed discretely using a thermal-optical method50 which detects a wider range of BC compounds than the SP2 method. Table S1 summarizes the ice core records and respective measurement methods.</p><p>Potential sources of uncertainties in the BC deposition fluxes include instrumental limitations (e.g., under-detection of very large BC particles), dating errors (&lt;\u00b15 years in some cores), post-depositional effects (e.g., wind scouring of snow, melt-refreeze cycles) and spatial noise (variability in deposition across space). For cores collected in the dry firn zone of Greenland, these sources of uncertainties are relatively minor, but some are poorly quantified at other coring sites, and will require further study. However, it is unlikely that such uncertainties would affect BC deposition trends on decadal scales that are the focus of the present study.</p><p>For each ice core, following standard procedures, the annual BC deposition flux (mg m\u22122 yr\u22121) was calculated by multiplying the observed BC concentrations by the estimated annual net water-equivalent accumulation. For Holtedahlfonna, EC deposition was calculated by dividing the total amount of EC on a filter sample by the known cross section of the ice sample and the number of years covered in one filtered ice sample27.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FLEXPART modeling</emphasis></p><p>As in previous studies interpreting ice core data15,17,41, the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART version 10.451,52 was used to obtain FES for the ice cores. The FLEXPART runs ingested meteorological input from the coupled climate reanalysis for the 20th century53,54 (CERA-20C) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) at a resolution of 2\u00b0 x 2\u00b0, every 6 h, and with 91 vertical levels. For the time period of 1900\u20131999 we performed monthly backward simulations from each ice core location, using FLEXPART\u2019s capacity to quantify FES of the deposition in backward mode55. As the height of the ice core locations at some mountain sites (especially Colle Gnifetti and Mt. Elbrus) is severely underestimated in the CERA-20C data (Table S1), the scavenging height considered for wet deposition was corrected to the real height of the topography for all locations. The definition of the BC aerosol is taken from ref. 56. Similar to the widely used backward mode for atmospheric concentrations55, we obtain spatially resolved FES field57 s on a three-dimensional grid. They represent the deposition at the receptor (\u00b5g m\u22122 s) that would result from an unit emission of 1 kg s\u22121 in a respective model grid cell. For the analysis we used monthly resolved footprints of the 100 years averaged over the 100-year CERA-20C period, combined with emissions from 1850\u20132000 to get modelled deposition fluxes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emissions</emphasis></p><p>For biomass burning BC emissions, we used historical emissions (1750\u20132015)58. For anthropogenic BC emissions, we used two different datasets. One is the historical gridded anthropogenic emission inventory59 used for the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project (CMIP) 560, and the other the more recent inventory61 used for CMIP662. Both inventories provide monthly varying emission fields covering the periods from 1850\u20132000 to 1750\u20132014, respectively, on a 0.25 degree resolution. More details on the regional distribution of the two emission datasets can be found in the supplementary material.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inverse modeling</emphasis></p><p>To reconstruct historic emissions in four regions (North America, Europe, Russia and CES Asia), we used an inversion method based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate with Gaussian errors. The transfer matrix was built using modeled decadal average deposition fluxes at each site based on FLEXPART simulations. For each of the fifteen decades (1850\u20132000), the modeled deposition contributed by each emission region was rearranged into a sparse matrix where emissions were considered independent of each other. The fifteen decadal values for each of the thirteen sites resulted in an observation vector <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">y</emphasis> of length 195. The source regions were aggregated into four regions resulting in a control vector <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">x</emphasis> of length 60. The corresponding transfer matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">H</emphasis> has therefore 195 rows and 60 columns. The prior emission factors <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">x</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0</emphasis> (a vector of ones of length 60) multiplied by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">H</emphasis> yield the modeled deposition values. The cost function is1where <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0</emphasis> are the error covariance matrices of the observations and the emission factors, respectively63; with the notation of\u200663,64. In both cases the off-diagonal terms were set to zero. The diagonal terms of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis> contain contributions from the instrumental error of the observations <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">o</emphasis> and transport model uncertainty <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">m</emphasis> (we neglect other terms such as the representation error due to lack of information). The diagonal terms of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">o</emphasis> are set to the mean value of the observations from an assumed instrumental error of a factor two between different instrumental techniques from the literature65. The diagonal terms of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">m</emphasis> are the decadal variances of the observed values (that are affected by variability in transport). The diagonal terms of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">0</emphasis> were chosen based on the magnitude of the relative difference between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 emission and increase backward in time based on the assumption that earlier emissions are more uncertain than more recent ones. Therefore, the relative error is 30% for the most recent decade, linearly increasing to 100% for the first decade (1850\u20131860). The resulting posterior63 emission factors are2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We acknowledge ECMWF for the meteorological data.

RescEU assist member states hit by disasters when national capacities are overstretched.</p><p>Finally, MEPs are also prepared to give the Commission greater flexibility to make any necessary changes over the next seven years.</p><p>Quote</p><p>After the vote the rapporteur, Nikos ANDROULAKIS (SD, Greece) said: \"Today's vote shows Parliament's willingness to ensure that the EU Civil Protection Mechanism will be able to deliver. The cuts to the budget proposed by member states for one of the most successful and cost-efficient EU programmes are unacceptable. RescEU assets and civil protection operations need to be properly supported and defended: they embody EU solidarity at its best.\"</p><p>Next steps</p><p>The plenary will now vote on the report in one of its upcoming sessions, after which Parliament is ready to start negotiations with member states.</p><p>Background</p><p>The EU set up the European Civil Protection Mechanism in 2013 to help member states deal with increasingly frequent natural disasters. Until 2019, it was only based on a voluntary system, through which the EU coordinated the participating states' voluntary contributions to a country that requested assistance. In 2017 alone, the Mechanism was used 18 times for forest fire emergencies in Europe. Portugal, Italy, Montenegro, France, and Albania all received assistance via the Mechanism to respond to forest fires.</p><p>Since 2019, when rescEU was created, the EU can now also directly assist member states hit by disasters when national capacities are overstretched. It establishes a pan-European reserve of fire-fighting aeroplanes and helicopters, specialised medical supplies and equipment and other resources. The Mechanism was recently used to repatriate EU citizens from Wuhan in China, following the outbreak of the Coronavirus COVID-19.</p><p>* * *</p><p>* At least EUR 1.4 billion needed for the 2021-2027 Civil Protection Mechanism</p><p>* Amount allocated for prevention, preparedness and response must be specified</p><p>* Larger part of the funding should go to preparedness</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7043818 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7043818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-9HV1-JC11-10KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><timeReceived>6:53 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

More than 2,000 firefighters are struggling night and day to control it, but they have repeatedly had to retreat to areas of safety and establish backup positions. This is because the Bootleg Fire has picked up speed and repeatedly changed directions, often driven by its own strong but quirky internal winds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This fire is a real challenge,\u00e2\u20ac explained Joe Hessel, the incident commander who is organizing the fight by multiple agencies against the blaze. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.\u00e2\u20ac After two weeks, it is only 30% contained. </p><p>It is still in the early days in 2021 for fires in the drought-stricken West. Bootleg is the type of fire that was once rarely seen, and then only in the hotter, drier days of late summer. But as it grew larger than the footprint of the city of Los Angeles, fire experts recognized it from its unruly behavior and the fat, wing-shaped \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pyro cumulus cloud\u00e2\u20ac that accumulated over it. It is the kind of wild \u00e2\u20ac\u0153megafire\u00e2\u20ac that after 10 years of trying they still haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to fully capture in their models. They see it as a result of the droughts and record-breaking heat caused by climate change. They have learned that fires like Bootleg become hot enough to create their own weather that includes tornado-like winds that can tear trees apart and dismantle power lines. The fires also draw strength and accumulate speed as they move over sloping terrain. They create enormous plumes of toxic smoke that drift for thousands of miles. Scientists have identified over 700 compounds created by such fires. The health effects of many of them are not yet known, but the growing economic impacts of these fires are becoming better understood. They have already caused one large utility to go bankrupt in California and are straining both federal and state fire-fighting budgets. Like many scientists, Janice Coen, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo., uses measurements from satellites, radar and laser systems to track the internal and external features of forest fires. She is still sure that if you track the impacts of heat on the internal winds and gauge the winds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 influence on the movement of the fires, the models will explain why megafires do what they do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very appealing, but getting it together has been more difficult than I thought.\u00e2\u20ac In 2014, she made one of the first breakthroughs in modeling fast-growing fires such as Bootleg. The King Fire in Northern California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sierra Nevada drew her attention. Surrounded by mild winds, the fire suddenly sprinted 15.5 miles up a mountain canyon, blazing through 40,000 acres in 11 hours. Earlier studies had often used the force of external winds to track fires. Coen was able to estimate the much greater power of the fire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own internal winds. She discovered that before the fire, the shape of the canyon and the trees and other vegetation in it had been carefully measured by radar and pulsed laser devices for an unrelated fire experiment by federal agencies. She compared those measurements with similar calculations she made after the fire to show how the heat and winds the fire generated created the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal dynamics\u00e2\u20ac that caused the fire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid movement up the drought-parched canyon. Experts in the past had used wind estimates from stations that were often outside the fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which missed the fire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own weather-creating forces. The discovery also shed light on the risks involved when foresters and others start controlled fires intended to reduce fire damages by thinning some forests. Coen pointed out that three people were killed and 22 homes were damaged or destroyed by a fire set by the Colorado State Forest Service in March 2012. She noted in her study that most firefighters continue to do their jobs effectively, despite the fact that many scientists believe that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire behavior is entering a new regime\u00e2\u20ac where larger fires are behaving differently. According to her study, 80% to 96% of areas burned by fires in the United States are caused by about 1% of the fires reported. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, there are currently 83 large fires burning in 13 Western states. So far this year, fires have scorched 2.58 million acres, damage well beyond the rate set by this time last year. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread smoke\u00e2\u20ac from these fires covers much of the Intermountain West, according to the agency, which said 19,300 firefighters are battling the flames. Unlike the internal winds that make large fires grow and shift directions faster, the smoke issue poses dangers for people thousands of miles away from the fires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a clear indication that extreme wildfire aerosols have impacts on people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health, especially in areas that are in fire regions,\u00e2\u20ac said Frank Flocke, another NCAR researcher. The science of how to protect people from it, he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is still in its infancy.\u00e2\u20ac The most dangerous ingredients are tiny particles that scientists call PM2.5. They are so small they can penetrate tissues in the human heart and lungs. Around fires they can exceed health limits by as much as four to five times and can collect overnight in nearby valleys. The particles from Western fires can rise into the stratosphere and reach the American Midwest, Flocke said. He noted that masks used to protect against COVID-19 can help reduce the risks of PM2.5. A better understood aspect of larger fires is their economic impact, which is studied by a variety of experts, particularly those in California. The University of California, Berkeley, has held a series of seminars on the growth of wildfires and what can be done about them. One attendee was Michael Wara, a lawyer and director of the climate and energy policy program at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. He published a study that looked at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s epic wildfires and found that it is becoming \"increasingly clear\u00e2\u20ac there is no way for California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state, local and federal firefighting agencies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to firefight the state out of the crisis.\u00e2\u20ac Wara proposes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major investment\u00e2\u20ac in California buildings to make them more resistant to embers blown from fires. He also called for a program to help communities protect areas near forests. A third element would be to find safer ways to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-intensity\u00e2\u20ac fires to reduce accumulations of drying timber, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000017ac571d4d6ad7fe77361e70000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D7-9N81-JDGB-00C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX000166</classCode><className>INSOLVENCY &amp; BANKRUPTCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001006</classCode><className>LASERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N221120CC</classCode><className>ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION &amp; DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX002176</classCode><className>RADAR SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001006</classCode><className>LASERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX543</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS153</classCode><className>OREGON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's not the Bay Area out there.\"</p><p>At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.</p><p>Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.</p><p>Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek - both with fewer than 250 people - and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.</p><p>\"The Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,\" Johnston said. \"There are no suburbs in that area.\"</p><p>But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's current size puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.</p><p>These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.</p><p>The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles in 2002 in the Rogue River\u00e2 \"Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.</p><p>By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.</p><p>\"I think it's important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large,\" he said. \"One of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger.\"</p><p>That's little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.</p><p>On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.</p><p>Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.</p><p>Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple \"slop fires\" - patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze - before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers.</p><p>\"We are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,\" said Joe Hessel, incident commander. \"This fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday, affecting a total of 767 square miles, the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center said.</p><p>Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>At the other end of Oregon, a fire in the northeast mountains grew to nearly 26 square miles.</p><p>The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.</p><p>Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.</p><p>A complex of fires where the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho meet also grew, reaching 167 square miles. The Snake River Complex was 44% contained. The complex was made up of three fires started by lightning on July 7. Flames were chewing through a mix of grass and timber in an extremely remote area of steep terrain about 20 miles south of Lewiston, Idaho.</p><p>And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles with no containment.</p><p>Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The monstrous wildfire burning in Oregon has grown to a third the size of Rhode Island and spreads miles each day, but evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted with its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland.</p><p>The 476-square-mile (1,210-square-kilometer) Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles (483 kilometers) southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges.</p><p>If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, \u201cit would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,\u201d said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. \u201cBut it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there.\u201d</p><p>At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died.</p><p>Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote.</p><p>Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek \u2014 both with fewer than 250 people \u2014 and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs.</p><p>\u201cThe Bootleg Fire is threatening ranch houses that are in pretty far-flung areas,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThere are no suburbs in that area.\u201d</p><p>But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's current size puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest.</p><p>These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out.</p><p>The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) in 2002 in the Rogue River\u2013Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The largest fire of any type was the Long Draw Fire in 2012, which incinerated 872 square miles (2,260 square kilometers) of mostly sagebrush and rangeland in the endless expanses of southeastern Oregon, where almost no one lives.</p><p>By the time the Bootleg Fire is extinguished months from now, it will likely be as big or bigger than those fires, but research shows that Oregon once experienced megafires much larger than these fairly often, Johnston said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to take the long view of wildfire. In the context of the last couple hundreds years, the Bootleg Fire is not large,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things my lab group does is reconstruct historical fires, and fires that were burning in that area in the 1600s and 1700s were just as big as the Bootleg Fire or bigger.\u201d</p><p>That's little reassurance for fire crews battling the current blaze, which is 25% contained.</p><p>On Monday, flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat from the flames for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin.</p><p>Fire pushed by winds and fueled by bone-dry conditions jumped fire-retardant containment lines and pushed up to 4 miles into new territory, authorities said.</p><p>Fire crews were also rushing to corral multiple \u201cslop fires\u201d \u2014 patches of flames that escaped fire lines meant to contain the blaze \u2014 before they grew in size. One of those smaller fires was already nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) in size. Thunderstorms with dry lightning were possible Monday as well, heightening the dangers.</p><p>\u201cWe are running firefighting operations through the day and all through the night,\u201d said Joe Hessel, incident commander. \u201cThis fire is a real challenge, and we are looking at sustained battle for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p><p>The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the U.S. West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington state alone on Monday, affecting a total of 767 square miles (1,986 square kilometers), the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center said.</p><p>Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p><p>At the other end of Oregon, a fire in the northeast mountains grew to nearly 26 square miles (49 square kilometers).</p><p>The Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, rural communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.</p><p>Natural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.</p><p>A complex of fires where the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho meet also grew, reaching 167 square miles (433 square kilometers). The Snake River Complex was 44% contained. The complex was made up of three fires started by lightning on July 7. Flames were chewing through a mix of grass and timber in an extremely remote area of steep terrain about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Lewiston, Idaho.</p><p>And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 36 square miles (93 square kilometers) with no containment.</p><p>Thunderstorms expected to roll through Monday night could bring winds to fan the flames and lightning that could spark new ones, the National Weather Service said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-3f102582aa78c2400a95374a2fb0752920210719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:635R-T2J1-DYMD-60YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1082\"/><timeReceived>11:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

RescEU assist member states hit by disasters when national capacities are overstretched.</p><p>Finally, MEPs are also prepared to give the Commission greater flexibility to make any necessary changes over the next seven years.</p><p>Quote</p><p>After the vote the rapporteur, Nikos ANDROULAKIS (SD, Greece) said: \"Today's vote shows Parliament's willingness to ensure that the EU Civil Protection Mechanism will be able to deliver. The cuts to the budget proposed by member states for one of the most successful and cost-efficient EU programmes are unacceptable. RescEU assets and civil protection operations need to be properly supported and defended: they embody EU solidarity at its best.\"</p><p>Next steps</p><p>The plenary will now vote on the report in one of its upcoming sessions, after which Parliament is ready to start negotiations with member states.</p><p>Background</p><p>The EU set up the European Civil Protection Mechanism in 2013 to help member states deal with increasingly frequent natural disasters. Until 2019, it was only based on a voluntary system, through which the EU coordinated the participating states' voluntary contributions to a country that requested assistance. In 2017 alone, the Mechanism was used 18 times for forest fire emergencies in Europe. Portugal, Italy, Montenegro, France, and Albania all received assistance via the Mechanism to respond to forest fires.</p><p>Since 2019, when rescEU was created, the EU can now also directly assist member states hit by disasters when national capacities are overstretched. It establishes a pan-European reserve of fire-fighting aeroplanes and helicopters, specialised medical supplies and equipment and other resources. The Mechanism was recently used to repatriate EU citizens from Wuhan in China, following the outbreak of the Coronavirus COVID-19.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123535166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCH-SJH1-DYTH-G0BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The country is establishing new institutional arrangements for climate change issues, including the recently formed Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change (MoEUCC), and is updating its National Climate Change Action Plan. The intensification of climate-related events in recent years--including floods, forest fires, and sea pollution--and the potential implications of the European Union (EU) Green Deal for Turkiye's economy have contributed to the urgency of the country's climate change agenda. Most recently, the war in Ukraine and attendant energy supply disruptions and price increases highlight risks for countries like Turkiye that rely on fossil fuel imports, underscoring the urgency of climate action in support of energy security and affordability.</p><p>This Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) explores opportunities and trade-offs for aligning Turkiye's development goals with its recent commitments on climate change. It explores how climate action--in line with the country's mitigation goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2053 as well as its adaptation and resilience needs--would affect Turkiye's growth and development. It looks at how climate action can help achieve the country's development objectives, capture opportunities offered by green technologies and sectors, protect the economy against longer-term risks, such as large-scale disasters or carbon lock-in as the world transitions toward reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and support a just and inclusive transition (figure S.1).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.1: Turkiye's development and climate objectives</p><p>* * *</p><p>Turkiye has made considerable development progress since 1990, but macrofinancial volatility jeopardizes future progress. Rapid economic growth tripled income per capita to a peak of $12,000 in 2015, making Turkiye the world's 19th largest economy. However, since 2016, macroeconomic shocks and adverse geopolitical events have slowed the country's development progress. Unemployment has remained high--over 10 percent since 2015--and is compounded by low labor force participation, especially for women and youth. High labor informality persists, and, with a few exceptions, jobs are growing faster in low-productivity sectors. Foreign direct investment is estimated to have dropped from over 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to around 1 percent in 2019, with more than half going to real estate in the last two years. Low capital growth combined with low and declining total factor productivity growth have lowered potential growth to around 4 percent in 2021. In April 2022, consumer and producer price inflation reached a two-decade high of 70 and 122 percent year-over-year, respectively. While gross general government debt to GDP fell to a low of 28 percent in 2016, currency depreciation, COVID-19 outlays, and rising borrowing costs drove it to 42 percent in 2021, narrowing the government's fiscal space.</p><p>Although the increase in Turkiye's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been slower than economic growth and its per capita emissions are lower than in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) or EU countries, there is a strong case for a forceful mitigation agenda in Turkiye. The energy sector--which includes the power, transport, building, and industrial sectors--is the country's single largest contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for three-quarters of total emissions. Turkiye's power, transport, and agriculture sectors are less carbon-intensive than the EU average--partly due to the large penetration of renewable energy (RE) in Turkiye's power system and low motorization rates. However, coal dependency is high and set to increase further under current investment plans. And the building sector (residential and non-residential) is less energy-efficient than the EU average. Manufacturing is more carbon-intensive than the EU average, exposing Turkiye to risks if the EU introduces the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Turkiye's forested landscapes act as carbon sinks, reducing the country's net carbon emissions.</p><p>Turkiye's geographic, climatic, and socioeconomic conditions make it highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other environmental hazards, making adaptation and resilience high priorities. Turkiye has high vulnerability in 9 of 10 climate vulnerability dimensions, compared with a median of 2 of 10 in other OECD countries (figure S.2). Its transport system is more vulnerable than those of comparable countries, and the country is experiencing food security issues, increasing water stress, and unprecedented disaster events, such as the 2021 forest fire season. This vulnerability is due to a combination of climate factors, population exposure (for example, the share of the population exposed to floods and forest fires), and socioeconomic factors (such as the share of agriculture in the economy).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.2: Climate risk and vulnerability in Turkiye and other OECD countries</p><p>* * *</p><p>A resilient and net zero pathway can help Turkiye achieve its development and climate objectives but implies a significant departure from current trends and important policy changes</p><p>There are multiple possible paths for aligning Turkiye's development and climate objectives. To explore feasibility, costs, and benefits, we developed an illustrative resilient and net zero pathway (RNZP) that combines adaptation and resilience actions with the 2053 net zero pledge. The RNZP is based on two main principles:</p><p>* Boosting resilience and adaptation requires a whole-of-economy strategy and a supportive socioeconomic environment. The RNZP prioritizes supporting adaptation in the private sector by ensuring access to information, technology, and finance. It includes actions to enhance the resilience of critical public assets and services, agriculture systems and land use plans, water resource management, and financial resilience (including insurance and adaptive social protection and the integration of climate and disaster risks in macroeconomic and fiscal policies).</p><p>* Turkiye can achieve its 2053 net zero emissions target (figure S.3) but this will require major changes in many economic sectors. The transformation includes deep decarbonization of the power sector; a combination of energy efficiency and electrification in buildings; modal shift, energy efficiency, and electrification in transport; a change in current practices to maximize carbon sequestration from forest landscapes; and emissions reduction efforts in the rest of the economy (including industries, agriculture, waste management, and water management).</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.3: Historical emissions (left) and RNZP emissions (right)</p><p>* * *</p><p>The RNZP emphasizes several priority areas for boosting economy-wide resilience and adaptation. These include the need to facilitate adaptation by firms and people, for example by expanding public provision of climate and disaster risk information; adapting land use plans and protecting critical public assets and services, including strengthening resilience to severe and growing water-related risks; and mainstreaming adaptation, resilience, and disaster risk finance in macrofiscal policies, including by assessing the economic costs of climate change and disasters, and reflecting contingent liabilities in fiscal policies, budget allocation, and public investment.</p><p>In the RNZP, emissions from the power sector are significantly reduced by 2040, despite an increase in demand from electrification of end-use sectors (figure S.4). Even without a carbon constraint, new coal power plants are neither needed nor the least-cost option to meet growing electricity demand. Instead, Turkiye can achieve energy security through an accelerated pace of leastcost investments in domestic solar and wind--building on its track record of tripling renewable energy capacity in the last decade--and investing in energy efficiency, battery and pumped storage, geothermal, and gas generation with carbon capture and storage (as well as completion of the nuclear plant under construction). This would enable the country to meet a doubling of energy demand by 2053 to fuel its growth ambitions, with the added benefit of lowering emissions and improving energy security by reducing reliance on imported coal, gas, and oil.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.4: Turkiye's power system capacity (left) and electricity generation mix (right) in 2022 and 2040</p><p>* * *</p><p>By enabling Turkiye to achieve net zero emissions with significant residual emissions in hard-to-abate sectors, negative emissions from forest landscapes play a key role in the RNZP, but they also create risks. Forest carbon storage is vulnerable to economic and climatic factors, such as forest fires. A robust strategy toward net zero must therefore consider how to do more in emitting sectors if negative emissions from forests prove impossible--for example, due to increasingly frequent forest fires.</p><p>Achieving Turkiye's climate commitments would yield net economic gains, but require large public and private investments</p><p>The RNZP illustrates the feasibility and overall benefits of aligning development with climate-related goals. As Turkiye imports 99 percent of its gas and 93 percent of its oil, energy efficiency and renewable energy could generate major benefits by reducing air pollution, energy imports and expenditure, and vulnerability to disruptions in global energy markets. When all costs and co-benefits are accounted for, the net economic impact of the RNZP is positive over 2022-30, and it increases when considering longer-term horizons: the RNZP leads to a net $15 billion gain over 2022-30 and a $146 billion gain over 2022-40, largely due to reduced fuel imports and health benefits from decreasing air pollution (table S.1).</p><p>Large investments would be required, but remain manageable, when compared with the size of the Turkish economy. Compared with the baseline scenario that does not include climate objectives, Turkiye would need to invest an additional $68 billion over 2022-30 (in present value terms) in the RNZP; that is 1.0 percent of discounted cumulative GDP over the period. Over 2022-40, this number grows to $165 billion, or 1.2 percent of discounted cumulative GDP. These investments add 21 percent to the existing $319 billion needed over 2022-30 in key sectors: power ($52 billion), residential ($243 billion), and transport ($24 billion), and 34 percent to the $482 billion needed over 2022-40.</p><p>We can expect about half of these investments to come from the private sector. The ability to mobilize private capital depends on the macroeconomic context, sectoral regulations, financial sector deepening, and access to long-term capital. While the World Bank Group's forthcoming Country Private Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) will investigate these opportunities in more detail, this CCDR uses assumptions based on current shares of private investments, the need for publicly funded incentives to redirect and trigger private investments (for example, the public sector would provide half of the financing needed for residential buildings to attract the rest from private sources), and the needs for compensation and social expenditures, especially to manage the consequences of early closing of coal power plants and mines. With these assumptions--equivalent to a broadly 50-50 public-private investment split on average--the analysis finds that additional annual (undiscounted) public investment needs for the RNZP could be around $5 billion until 2025, and $6 billion by 2030 (figure S.5). These estimates can be compared with the 2020 public investment budget, which covers all sectors and totals 2.6 percent of GDP, or around $18 billion per year.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Table S.1: Investment needs and economic costs in the RNZP (additional compared with baseline)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.5: Additional annual investment needs for the RNZP</p><p>* * *</p><p>Integrating development and climate objectives would lead to higher growth and employment, but could create significant transition challenges for exposed sectors and their workers</p><p>Even without considering benefits from avoided climate change impacts, we expect the RNZP to increase GDP growth and employment, thanks to large investments, energy efficiency, technological upgrading, and reduced fuel costs (figure S.6). Turkiye's GDP grows faster in the RNZP, in which sectoral roadmaps are combined with economy-wide interventions, including carbon taxes with appropriate recycling. However, this growth benefit would be lower if carbon tax revenues are not recycled in a way that supports private sector investment and if additional investments in the RNZP crowd out other investments. Growth benefits are also markedly lower after 2035, as decarbonization of the power system gradually leads to higher electricity prices. The net impact on jobs is small, with 230,000 more jobs in 2030 in the RNZP, but with the growth slowdown after 2035 erasing these gains.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.6: Impact of the RNZP transition on GDP (right axis) and cumulative jobs (left axis), 2022-40</p><p>* * *</p><p>While the additional investments needed are significant, their overall impacts on the fiscal and external balances are relatively small. The analysis shows that additional investments raise capital and related imports, but savings in oil and gas imports offset these in the current account balance. Public debt levels in the RNZP rise by 1 to 3 percentage points of GDP compared with a baseline scenario, as government revenues from a carbon tax help offset borrowing for investment needs. This provides an indication of the fiscal space the government has should it choose to save less and instead take on a larger share of the total investment needed in capital and innovation to support the transition. Macroeconomic stability is essential to preserving this fiscal space and fostering private sector investments.</p><p>The impacts of decarbonization on consumption are positive. Policy makers need to pay careful attention to housing affordability, food security, electricity prices, mobility, and access to jobs and services. We expect the impact on inflation to be limited, with the effect on food and manufacturing prices under 1 percent in 2030 and below 2.5 percent in 2040. Additional carbon tax revenues can be used to compensate low-income households for adverse impacts, such as a rise in energy prices. With 13 percent of the carbon tax revenues recycled as cash transfers, all household income classes would benefit.</p><p>Decoupling emissions from growth involves economic restructuring and changes in labor demand, which poses challenges to a just and inclusive transition. Although Turkiye's green transition likely will create new jobs in environmentally friendly production, it will also place other jobs at risk, particularly in sectors with fewer options for transitioning to more sustainable ways of production (figure S.7). And this transition will affect a country with already significant social challenges, including those linked to the recent rise in poverty (with over 10 million people now below the poverty line), the world's largest refugee population, and low female labor force participation (the lowest among OECD countries). Turkiye's lower share of green jobs and its higher share of jobs that require upskilling compared with its peers also make it a challenge to upgrade the skills of its workforce. Ensuring a just and inclusive transition will require careful management of economic and labor market adjustments, investments in human capital and education, strong and adaptive social protection systems, and targeted interventions for retraining and reskilling.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure S.7: Impact of the RNZP on labor demand by sector, 2022-30</p><p>* * *</p><p>The advantages of pursuing the RNZP are greater if we account for global decarbonization trends and the benefits of retaining access to global markets and participating in global value chains. Climate action in other countries will affect Turkiye through changes in global demand, technologies in global value chains, and trade rules. The impacts of the EU's CBAM will be significant on a few emission-intensive industries that have high trade exposure to the EU market. Some of these industries will face lower output and employment, requiring action to facilitate structural adjustments both within and between sectors. But the aggregate macroeconomic impacts of an EU CBAM will be limited.</p><p>Turkiye's firms have a relatively high degree of sophistication, as reflected in their integration in global value chains and growing value-added from exports, and the country has large potential in green global value chains. The CBAM creates an opportunity for Turkiye to benefit in markets where competitors are more carbon-intensive, especially if the country makes increasing efforts on energy efficiency in industries and on the performance of the logistics system. Turkiye is already well integrated in electric mobility value chains and has significant opportunities to participate in the global solar and wind energy value chains, a topic that will be explored in the forthcoming CPSD.</p><p>This CCDR also looks at how natural risks may affect the economy, though it does not account for all threats. Analysis of floods and earthquakes/1 shows that, while there are large short-term welfare costs after big events, they are manageable in the long run, with total GDP losses in 2100 below 1.6 percent of GDP in 95 percent of the simulated scenarios. However, impacts on poor and vulnerable populations can be substantial, with the risk of a significant increase in transient poverty after large shocks. While floods and earthquake risks are widely distributed across the country's population, wildfire and food security risks mostly affect the poorest.</p><p>Climate change threatens agricultural productivity, rural incomes and employment, and food security, especially through its impact on water scarcity. The Global Food Security Index ranks Turkiye 47th for overall food security. Climate change patterns are expected to significantly impact yields, especially through increased water scarcity, and to pose challenges to the sustainability of Turkiye's fisheries and aquaculture. A 10 percent reduction in water supply could cost Turkiye 6 percent of GDP, about $50 billion. This would exacerbate food price pressures and overall food security concerns. Lower-income populations would be most affected, since the share of income they spend on food is three times larger than the richest households. Impacts on the tourism industry are also likely to affect incomes and growth. Assessment of these impacts, as well as adaptation priorities, is a priority for future work.</p><p>Short-term priorities include \"no regret\" options that contribute to growth and climate objectives, but also difficult changes in a few key sectors</p><p>Delaying some interventions could reduce short-term transition costs, allowing Turkiye to benefit from the decline in green technology costs and adjust its strategy as more information becomes available (table S.2). For example, while electrifying residential heat and other energy use is needed to achieve net zero emissions, doing so immediately magnifies the challenge of decarbonizing the power system. In contrast, the cost of electrifying existing buildings is manageable, so delaying this action until 2030 would allow Turkiye to benefit from cheaper technologies (heat pumps, induction cooking) and less carbon-intensive electricity. Similarly, completely decarbonizing Turkiye's carbon-intensive industry will require new technologies, such as hydrogen-based steel making and carbon capture and storage, but widespread implementation of these technologies is more realistic after 2030.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Table S.2: Illustrative list of policies, classified according to urgency and synergies with short-term growth</p><p>* * *</p><p>1 While earthquakes are not a climate hazard, most policies and measures to manage risks--from construction standards to disaster risk finance instruments--have to consider the full range of threats in their design, especially in a country that is as exposed to earthquake risks as Turkiye.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Some changes are urgent, because current trends are creating lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns that will increase costs and create financial risks, such as stranded assets. Particularly urgent is the need to realign current energy policies. This includes ending the costly support to domestic production and consumption of indigenous coal and stopping the construction of new coal power plants, which would be at high risk of becoming stranded assets before the end of their lifetimes./2</p><p>It would also require significant upscaling of renewable energy with a diversified power mix--including wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, gas generation with carbon capture and storage, and nuclear--as well as investments in energy storage, particularly battery energy storage, which the country has yet to start investing in. This clean energy transition is necessary to achieve the government's net zero target, and it would contribute to reducing dependency on imported energy without compromising energy security. It would also reduce exposure to geopolitical risks and energy price volatility on global and regional markets.</p><p>Other changes are urgent in sectors with long-lifetime assets, technological inertia, or declining natural capital. This includes action to improve energy efficiency in new residential buildings, which would reduce energy costs and retrofitting needs, be synergetic with increasing resilience to earthquakes and high temperatures, and facilitate the decarbonization of the power system. Similar interventions to support energy efficiency in carbon- or energy-intensive sectors would improve external competitiveness and productivity and help Turkiye's economy prepare for future climate-related trade policies implemented by its main trade partners. For technologies to decarbonize heavy industries to be available and cost-competitive by 2030, investments in research and development and in pilot projects--including identifying sequestration opportunities--should start immediately. Supporting a modal shift toward rail, public transit, and soft modes (such as cycling and walking) requires early action on transport infrastructure and supportive, risk-informed urban planning with transit-oriented development. Finally, growing climate and disaster risks make adaptation and resilience interventions equally urgent, such as improved water management and agriculture practices to preserve water resources and productive soils.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Table S.3. Summary of sample 2030 sectoral milestones for the illustrative RNZP</p><p>* * *</p><p>2 Turkiye's planned investments in new coal-fired power generation are the world's 5th largest and Turkiye alone accounts for 73 percent of the OECD and EU pre-construction pipeline.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Turkiye can use the RNZP and its priorities to define intermediate milestones, which it can use more directly to design policies, identify investments, and inform its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC). Table S.3 presents the 2030 milestones for the RNZP, which the government can use as medium-term targets for its next NDC, as a basis for sectoral ministry and agency proposals and investment plans, or to allocate budgets, track progress, and report to Parliament and the population.</p><p>Six short-term priorities to trigger the transition</p><p>Some interventions that tackle underlying structural obstacles to Turkiye's growth and development can also help achieve the country's climate objectives. Those include measures to promote:</p><p>* Macroeconomic stability: Reducing macroeconomic volatility, stabilizing inflation, building external reserves, and maintaining a prudent level of public debt, all of which are essential to enable the required public and private investments.</p><p>* Human capital and social protection: Investing in people through health and education, ensuring higher labor force participation (especially for women), and building stronger and more comprehensive safety nets to reduce macroeconomic transition costs and minimize social costs.</p><p>* Institutional strengthening: Better integrated policy documents, improved economic decision-making and budgetary processes, and more efficient public spending through procurement and public investment management.</p><p>Making improvements in these three domains creates clear synergies: in addition to accelerating growth, they would make the economy better able to manage the transition toward climate resilience and net zero emissions. But these interventions also need to be complemented with a set of targeted sectoral approaches.</p><p>Priority 1. Realign energy policies to exit from coal and decarbonize the power sector: Make parallel efforts, through a new energy security compact, to commit a just and inclusive transition from coal, by (i) not building new coal plants; (ii) retiring most existing coal power plants and mines by 2040 and compensating for lost future revenues; (iii) supporting laid-off workers and affected communities; (iv) facilitating environmental remediation; (v) scaling up renewable energy; (vi) deploying grid integration measures, particularly battery and pumped storage, remunerating storage services, and expanding and digitalizing transmission networks; and (vii) ensuring well-designed power markets, with careful consideration of implications for reliability and electricity prices.</p><p>Priority 2. Maximize the economic benefits of the transition with a supportive macroeconomic and financial environment: Implement macro-stabilizing and structural interventions to raise economic productivity by (i) alleviating factor market rigidities; (ii) removing or repurposing fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies, and deploying de-risking instruments; (iii) enabling public investments and mobilizing private investments through a tax reform that combines subsidy reform with a carbon tax (or an equivalent emissions trading system) in all sectors except agriculture and landfills; (iv) mainstreaming climate objectives in macro-fiscal and monetary policy; and (v) reforming the financial sector to extend tenor and taxonomy, developing green and blue bonds, and improving transparency and disclosure of climate-related risks in the financial system. The latter will be further explored in the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program.</p><p>Priority 3. Make the economy more energy efficient: Establish a more ambitious National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2030 for transport, buildings, urban industry, and waste sectors, with (i) more stringent and well-enforced building standards and codes; (ii) strategies and investments to support modal shifts in transport and transit-oriented urban development; (iii) a national program for building renovations; (iv) national schemes to support energy efficiency in factories, including energy audits and efficiency reporting, and improved recycling programs for metals, e-waste, and other waste; and (v) a progressive and coordinated shift toward electrification in industries, as well as space and water heating, coupled with rooftop solar schemes to offset impacts on the grid.</p><p>Priority 4. Maximize negative emissions from forests and landscapes: Mainstream sustainable forest management to enhance carbon sinks and manage climate risks (especially wildfires), with investment in landscape restoration through reforestation, forest and grassland rehabilitation, cropland management, and wetland conservation.</p><p>Priority 5. Make growth more resilient and sustainable: Adopt an economy-wide approach that mainstreams (i) resilience and future climate change impacts in public and private sector decisions, by including climate risks in budgeting procedures; (ii) infrastructure and building construction standards; (iii) procurement and public investment management; (iv) urban and infrastructure planning; (v) water management plans and regulations, complemented by modernized irrigation and drainage and diversified freshwater resources; (vi) agriculture policies and support, including subsidy repurposing; and (vii) social protection systems.</p><p>Priority 6. Minimize social disruptions and ensure a just and inclusive transition: Build a strategy that (i) identifies at-risk sectors and workers; (ii) anticipates and prepares for retraining and reskilling needs; and (iii) strengthens social protection systems to make them more reactive, flexible, and better able to absorb expected and unexpected shocks. Repurposing retired coal power plants and closed coal mines can not only lead to economic and energy transition, but also mitigate the social impacts and disruption of these closures.</p><p>The way ahead</p><p>This CCDR explores important issues and opportunities created by climate change for Turkiye but does not provide definitive answers. There are two priorities for future analytical work:</p><p>* First, the government needs to design a long-term strategy that is integrated into its development and economic plans and policies and prepare a revision of its NDC that is consistent with Turkiye's long-term commitments and objectives.</p><p>* Second, broad policy recommendations need to be translated into much more detailed policy advice and investment plans. For example, detailed policy recommendations on the design of a just and inclusive transition from coal will be the focus of follow-up analytical products.</p><p>Turkiye's development and climate objectives are ambitious, and the policies and interventions that are needed to achieve them involve risks and uncertainty, making it important to follow an iterative approach. Careful monitoring and evaluation are needed to detect and manage expected and unexpected negative effects and to adjust policies over time. Turkiye does not need to set its strategy in stone for the next 30 years. Climate policy takes place in a context of incomplete knowledge and large uncertainties, which will only be resolved as countries implement climate policies, carefully monitor their impacts and results, and learn from their successes and failures. Contexts of deep uncertainty require flexible and regularly adjusted policies. This CCDR identifies a short-term strategy for 2022-30 that minimizes short-term trade-offs and maximizes synergies. It is important to consider the longer-term pathway over 2022-40 or even to 2053, keeping in mind that the strategy can and will be adjusted between now and 2030, based on what is learned in the meantime.</p><p>* * *</p><p>5. Conclusions and 2022-30 policy recommendations</p><p>The CCDR brings together Turkiye's development goals with its climate commitments--in the form of its 2053 net zero pledge--its adaptation and resilience needs, and its aims to prioritize synergies and manage trade-offs across these parallel objectives. It explores how climate action and policies can generate short-term benefits, raise potential growth and the quality of economic growth, and protect the economy against longer-term risks, such as large-scale disasters or fallout of the global transition toward reduced greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>5.1. A no-regret path to 2030</p><p>The RNZP can be used to define intermediate milestones that can be used more directly to design policies, identify investments, and inform the next NDC. Table 5.1 presents the 2030 milestones for our RNZP, which the government can use as medium-term targets--including for medium-term plans such as NDCs--sectoral ministries and agencies can use for proposals and investment plans, and the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, the Presidency of Strategy and Budget, the MoEUCC, and the CCACB can use to allocate budgets, track progress over time, and report to Parliament and the population.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Table 5.1: Summary of sample 2030 sectoral milestones for the illustrative RNZP</p><p>* * *</p><p>The CCDR distinguishes actions that are urgent from interventions that can be delayed to reduce short-term costs, benefit from the expected decline in the cost of green technologies, and allow strategy adjustments as more information becomes available. Some policy changes or investments can be delayed without increasing the cost of the entire transition, making it possible to prevent early trade-offs with other development objectives. This is the case for the electrification of buildings, for instance. While electrifying heat and other residential energy use is needed to achieve net zero emissions in 2053, doing it immediately has a strong impact on electricity demand, magnifying the challenge of decarbonizing the power system and reducing the share of coal. In contrast, the cost of electrifying existing buildings is manageable, so delaying this action to 2030 brings the benefits of cheaper technologies (heat pumps, induction cooking) and electricity with a lower carbon intensity. Similarly, decarbonizing Turkiye's carbon-intensive industrial sector will require new technologies, such as hydrogen-based steel making and CCUS, and it is more realistic to implement these technologies after 2030. However, delayed implementation does not mean delayed action: for technologies to be available and cost-competitive in 2030, investments in R&amp;D and pilot projects-- including to identify carbon sequestration opportunities--should start immediately.</p><p>The short-term interventions of the RNZP (over 2022-30) are largely \"no regret\" ones: taken together they lead to aggregate economic gains. To keep short-term costs as low as possible, and maximize development benefits, short-term interventions are focused on subsidy reform and tax reform, energy efficiency (in residential buildings and transport), renewable energy (the cheapest energy source), and interventions with large co-benefits in the form of reduced air pollution, urban congestion, or exposure to geopolitical risks and energy price volatility on global and regional markets. The most expensive transformations--such as the last 10 percent of decarbonizing the power sector or the electrification of residential heating--are postponed to after 2030 or 2040.</p><p>Not everything can be postponed: some changes are urgent, because inaction is locking Turkiye into carbon-intensive patterns that will increase costs and create financial risks, such as stranded assets. Particularly urgent are the changes that affect long-lived infrastructure assets: decarbonizing the power system, modal shift in transportation with supportive risk-informed urban planning, and energy efficiency and resilience in buildings. Among the most urgent measures, some create challenges in terms of financing (for example, energy efficiency of buildings, and pilot projects for new technologies), social impacts (for example, the exit from coal), or implementation and enforcement (for example, forestry). As such, they require specific attention and support. And even delayed implementation does not mean delayed action: for technologies to be available and cost-competitive to decarbonize heavy industries in 2030, investing in R&amp;D and pilot projects--including to identify sequestration opportunities--should start immediately.</p><p>5.2. From medium-term milestones to short-term policy recommendations</p><p>Due to its multisectoral nature, this CCDR cannot describe in detail the policy changes and investments needed to make these transitions happen. However, it can highlight the most important policy priorities. Some of these are already well covered in other reports or policy documents; others are priorities for future analytical and policy work.</p><p>Some interventions that tackle underlying structural obstacles to Turkiye's growth and development can also promote the achievement of climate objectives. Recommendations in these domains are available in other World Bank documents,/77 and include:</p><p>* Macroeconomic stability: Reducing macroeconomic volatility and boosting investor confidence by stabilizing inflation and exchange rates and maintaining a predictable and transparent regulatory framework; building external reserves, resolving corporate distress, cleaning bank balance sheets; maintaining a prudent level of public debt; and accounting for contingent liabilities, including those arising from public private partnerships or private finance initiatives.</p><p>* Human capital, labor markets, and social protection: Investing in people, through health, education, and upskilling investment, to support the transition to greener occupations; facilitating workers' transition from declining to growing sectors with appropriate labor market regulations; boosting social support to mitigate the transition's impact on poverty and employment and increase the population's resilience to climate and environmental shocks;...</p><p>77 These include: Turkey Economic Monitors, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/publication/economic-monitor;\">https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/publication/economic-monitor;</url> Turkiye Public finance Review (forthcoming); Firm Productivity and Economic Growth in Turkey (2018), <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31931;\">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31931;</url> Leveraging Global Value Chains for growth in Turkey (2022), <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37095\">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37095</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>...expanding coverage and implementing regional and/or community-based targeting approaches, using community-driven development platforms.</p><p>- Institutional strengthening: Ensuring robust and efficient national and subnational processes for economic decision making, aligning policy documents, budgeting, tax collection, access to finance, public spending and procurement, and public investment management. Embracing digitalization, which offers opportunities to boost resilience and efficiency in public services and infrastructure system through smart meters, smart irrigation, smart manufacturing, smart waste management, e-mobility, and so on.</p><p>Improvements in these three domains create obvious synergies between development and climate objectives, and would immediately accelerate growth and improve population well-being, while improving the economy's ability to manage the transition at a lower cost.</p><p>Priority 1. Realign energy policies to exit from coal and decarbonize the power sector: Make parallel efforts, through a new energy security compact, to commit a just and inclusive transition from coal, by (i) not building new coal plants; (ii) retiring most existing coal power plants and mines by 2040 and compensating for lost future revenues; (iii) supporting laid-off workers and affected communities; (iv) facilitating environmental remediation; (v) scaling up renewable energy; (vi) deploying grid integration measures, particularly battery and pumped storage, remunerating storage services, and expanding and digitalizing transmission networks; and (vii) ensuring well-designed power markets, with careful consideration of implications for reliability and electricity prices.</p><p>Priority 2. Maximize the economic benefits of the transition with a supportive macroeconomic and financial environment: Implement macro-stabilizing and structural interventions to raise economic productivity by (i) alleviating factor market rigidities; (ii) removing or repurposing fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies, and deploying de-risking instruments; (iii) enabling public investments and mobilizing private investments through a tax reform that combines subsidy reform with a carbon tax (or an equivalent ETS) in all sectors except agriculture and landfills; (iv) mainstreaming climate objectives in macro-fiscal and monetary policy; and (v) reforming the financial sector to extend tenor and taxonomy, developing green and blue bonds, and improving transparency and disclosure of climate-related risks in the financial system. The latter will be further explored in the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program.</p><p>Priority 3. Make the economy more energy efficient: Establish a more ambitious National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2030 for transport, buildings, urban industry, and waste sectors, with (i) more stringent and well-enforced building standards and codes; (ii) strategies and investments to support modal shifts in transport and transit-oriented urban development; (iii) a national program for building renovations; (iv) national schemes to support energy efficiency in factories, including energy audits and efficiency reporting, and improved recycling programs for metals, e-waste, and other waste; and (v) a progressive and coordinated shift toward electrification in industries, as well as space and water heating, coupled with rooftop solar schemes to offset impacts on the grid.</p><p>Priority 4. Maximize negative emissions from forests and landscapes: Mainstream sustainable forest management to enhance carbon sinks and manage climate risks (especially wildfires), with investment in landscape restoration through reforestation, forest and grassland rehabilitation, cropland management, and wetland conservation.</p><p>Priority 5. Make growth more resilient and sustainable: Adopt an economy-wide approach that mainstreams (i) resilience and future climate change impacts in public and private sector decisions, by including climate risks in budgeting procedures; (ii) infrastructure and building construction standards; (iii) procurement and public investment management; (iv) urban and infrastructure planning; (v) water management plans and regulations, complemented by modernized irrigation and drainage and diversified freshwater resources; (vi) agriculture policies and support, including subsidy repurposing; and (vii) social protection systems.</p><p>Priority 6. Minimize social disruptions and ensure a just and inclusive transition: Build a strategy that (i) identifies at-risk sectors and workers; (ii) anticipates and prepares for retraining and reskilling needs; and (iii) strengthens social protection systems to make them more reactive, flexible, and better able to absorb expected and unexpected shocks. Repurposing retired coal power plants and closed coal mines can not only lead to economic and energy transition, but also mitigate the social impacts and disruption of these closures.</p><p>5.3. The way ahead</p><p>This CCDR explores some of the most important issues and opportunities created by climate change for Turkiye. But more work is needed to provide specific policy recommendations and sectoral roadmaps. There are two priorities for future analytical work.</p><p>First, Turkiye needs to design a long-term strategy that is integrated into development and economic plans and policies. The RNZP we propose in this CCDR is an illustrative pathway to demonstrate feasibility and explore costs and benefits. A necessary next step is a long-term strategy, developed and owned by the government, which it can then use as the basis for its NDC and policy design. Two current World Bank engagements--on the energy transition and low-carbon long-term development-- aim to support this process.</p><p>Second, we need to translate the broad recommendations of this CCDR into more detailed policy advice. It is not possible to explore the full complexity of each recommendation in an economy-wide report like the CCDR. In some cases, extensive explorations already exist--see, for example, the latest Turkiye Economic Monitor/78 or recent analytical work on water or agriculture. Further sector-specific work is still needed, with more engagement from government and stakeholders. Detailed policy recommendations regarding the design of a just exit from coal, for example, were out of the scope of this CCDR, but are the topic of follow-up engagements.</p><p>One important conclusion of this CCDR is the need for immediate actions to boost resilience and reduce carbon emissions, and these actions should not be delayed by further analytical work. Like economic and development policy, climate policy takes place in a context of incomplete knowledge and large irreducible uncertainties. Analytical work can help, but many uncertainties will only be resolved as the country implements its climate policies, carefully monitors their impacts and results, and learns from its successes and failures.</p><p>A long-term strategy for climate change adaptation and mitigation is necessarily an adaptive strategy that will be regularly evaluated and revised to account for both new knowledge and technologies, and actions in the rest of the world. Contexts of deep uncertainty require flexible and regularly adjusted policies. While it is important to consider the longer-term pathway over 2022-40 or even to 2053, this strategy can and will be adjusted between now and 2030, based on new learnings and knowledge. For the next eight years, this CCDR identifies a short-term strategy that minimizes short-term trade-offs and maximizes synergies and can contribute to successfully achieving Turkiye's development objectives and accelerating its progress toward high-income status.</p><p>78 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/publication/economic-monitor\">https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/publication/economic-monitor</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>(Continues with Part 2 of 2)</p><p>The report is posted at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/37521/T%c3%bcrkiye%20CCDR%20Full%20Report.pdf\">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/37521/T%c3%bcrkiye%20CCDR%20Full%20Report.pdf</url></p><p>TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Around 2,300 firefighters in New South Wales state were making the most of relatively benign conditions by frantically consolidating containment lines around more than 110 blazes and patrolling for lightning strikes, state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. \"Unfortunately with lightning strikes, it's not always the next day they pop up,\" Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.</p><p>\"They can smolder around in trees and in root systems for a couple of days and pop up under drier, hotter conditions, so we are very mindful of that as we head into Friday,\" he added. The containment work comes as the death toll since the fires flared in September rose by one to 26. Matt Kavanagh, a 43-year-old Victoria state firefighter, was killed in a vehicle crash Friday, officials said. Kavanagh was on the road working to extinguish unattended campfires when the crash happened, said Chris Hardman, Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer. It took police a few days to investigate his death before they confirmed it was linked to his work on the wildfires and therefore part of the disaster's official death toll. \"He's such a well-loved guy,\" Hardman told reporters. \"For those people who knew Matt, it's going to take a long time. I can't imagine what that family is going through and what Matt's colleagues are going through. It's just such a very sad day.\" The unprecedented fire crisis in southeast Australia that has destroyed 2,000 homes and shrouded major cities in smoke has focused many Australians on how the nation adapts to climate change. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced fierce criticism both domestically and internationally for downplaying the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes. Several firefighters unions urged the federal government today to order a royal commission -- the nation's highest form of investigation -- into the wildfires. Environmental group Greenpeace Australia said any such investigation must analyze the role of climate change. \"This unprecedented and catastrophic fire season still has months to go and the next one will not be far behind. We need to start planning now so the chaotic scenes witnessed this summer do not become an annual occurrence,\" Greenpeace Australia Pacific's head of campaigns, Jamie Hanson, said in a statement. \"But this inquiry needs to go beyond the symptoms of the bushfire crisis and look at the largest underlying cause of the conditions that have exacerbated these fires, which is burning coal.\" -- Rod McGuirk, Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4T-TFW1-DY7N-F18F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In a new interview, the Till Death actor admitted that she instantly connected with the musician when they first met. However, she felt that their chemistry was too good to be true and even went as far as to make a pros and cons list before letting her heart win in the end. </p><p><br/><br/> Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly | Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for iHeartMedia <br/><br/>Megan Fox was initially hesitant to get close to Machine Gun Kelly, despite their instant connection <br/><br/> While recently speaking with Who What Wear[4], Fox got candid about her romance with rapper Colson Baker aka Machine Gun Kelly. <br/><br/>The two first met[5] on the set of the thriller Midnight in the Switchgrass, where they instantly connected. <br/><br/>'When I met [Colson Baker], I knew instantly that this is a soul I've traveled with before, that this was a soul-mate connection, and that there was a purpose here,' she explained. <br/><br/>Though their chemistry was off the charts, Fox admits that there was some hesitation on her part. <br/><br/>'There was my logical brain chiming and being like, 'This will never work for 101 reasons,'' the actor confessed. <br/><br/>Fox had even made a pros and cons list before acting on her feelings for the musician. In the end, she noticed that Kelly's pros outweighed his cons. <br/><br/> Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly | Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) <br/><br/> RELATED: Megan Fox Says She Went To 'Hell For Eternity' During an Ayahuasca Ceremony With Machine Gun Kelly[6] <br/><br/>'I knew right away that he was what I call a twin flame,' the Jennifer's Body star said of Kelly during their first joint interview for the podcast Give them Lala With Randall[7] in July 2020. 'Instead of a soul mate, a twin flame is actually where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time.' <br/><br/>Fox continued, 'So we're actually two halves of the same soul, I think. And I said that to him almost immediately, because I felt it right away.' <br/><br/> Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly started dating in June 2020 <br/><br/> Fox and Kelly officially began dating in June 2020, a month after it was announced that she and her husband Brian Austin Green had split[8] after nearly 10 years of marriage. <br/><br/>The couple confirmed their romance in the most millennial way possible \u2014 on Instagram. 'Waited for eternity to find you again,' Kelly wrote[9] under a black-and-white photo of him and Fox. A few days later, she posted a similar image[10], captioning it, 'Achingly Beautiful Boy My heart is yours.' <br/><br/>Since going public with their relationship, Fox and Kelly haven't been afraid to showcase their love for each other. Not only have they packed on the PDA on social media, red carpets, and the streets of Los Angeles, the pair have also gushed about each other during interviews. <br/><br/>In September 2020, Kelly revealed on The Howard Stern Show[11] that he fell for Fox right away. <br/><br/>'I didn't know what [love] was until me and her made eye contact,' he said. 'That's when I was like, 'Whoa.'' <br/><br/>Kelly added, 'After I made the big chunk of the album, I did fall in love for the first time. That was my first experience with being open to love and stuff like that. I definitely wasn't set up to believe that that's something that could ever exist.' <br/><br/> Megan Fox compared her and Machine Gun Kelly's love to a tsunami <br/><br/> Though they haven't been dating for long, Fox and Kelly have something special, which she realized early into their relationship. <br/><br/>In a November 2020 interview with Nylon[12], Fox described her romance with the rapper as a 'once in a lifetime thing,' sharing that their connection is of 'mythic proportions.' <br/><br/> Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly | Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for iHeartMedia <br/><br/> RELATED: Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly Mimic Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton With A 'Bloody' Valentine's Day Necklace[13] <br/><br/>Fox went on to compare their relationship to a natural disaster, noting that what she and Kelly have is 'intense.' <br/><br/>'Loving him is like being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire,' she said. 'The intensity of merging with him is just overwhelming, and the threat it poses is so powerful but so beautiful that you have no choice to surrender with reverence and with gratitude.' <br/><br/>There's no question that Fox and Kelly are head over heels for one another. And to think their romance started with a simple pros and cons list. <br/> Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[14] <br/> [ 1]: <url

But she said the Republicans have \u201ca ways more to go\u201d to find common ground. Biden dropped $500 billion from his initial $2.3 trillion offer, and Psaki said the Republicans raised their $568 billion offer by about $50 billion. Republicans have rejected Biden's plan to pay for the road and broadband spending with a corporate tax increase.</p><p>\u201cThe ball is in the Republicans' court,\u201d Psaki said at the White House briefing.</p><p>On Monday, the president will be hosting Alaska\u2019s Republican congressional delegation to the White House for a bill signing ceremony on an unrelated cruise ship tourism measure. That's meant as a signal of potential areas of bipartisanship. The invited lawmakers could be key players in any infrastructure deal.</p><p>With a deadline a week away, the White House and Senate Republicans remain far apart after nearly two weeks of closed-door talks between Biden's team and senators. The lack of progress on Biden's effort to strike a bipartisan agreement has Democrats considering whether they should leave Republicans behind and try to pass his top priority on their own.</p><p>___</p><p>A little US city, battered by the virus, tells its stories</p><p>CENTRAL FALLS, R.I. (AP) \u2014 The beleaguered people of Central Falls moved quickly through the high school gym\u2019s injection stations and then to rest on dozens of metal folding chairs, borrowed from the Knights of Columbus.</p><p>Immunity was at hand, but no one was celebrating.</p><p>Central Falls \u2014 the poorest and smallest city in the nation\u2019s smallest state \u2014 is also among the hardest hit by COVID-19. Sorrow reaches across the city: The dead husband. The mother who came from Guatemala in search of a better life, only to die in a new land. The Polish priest who buried parishioner after parishioner.</p><p>The city has endured repeated waves of illness, with rates of confirmed cases that often dwarfed cities across New England.</p><p>___</p><p>___</p><p>UK Black activist critical in hospital after shooting</p><p>LONDON (AP) \u2014 An activist who has played a leading role in anti-racism demonstrations in Britain was in critical condition in a London hospital on Monday after being shot.</p><p>The Taking the Initiative Party said Sasha Johnson, who played a leading role in Black Lives Matter protests last year, was shot in the head on Sunday. Police and a friend said it did not appear to be a targeted attack, though the party said Johnson had received \u201cnumerous death threats\u201d related to her activism.</p><p>The party said Johnson was \u201ca strong, powerful voice for our people and our community.\u201d</p><p>The Metropolitan Police force said officers were called to reports of gunshots in the Peckham area of the city just before 3 a.m. on Sunday. Police said the shooting took place near a house where a party was taking place.</p><p>The police statement said a 27-year-old woman was in a hospital in critical condition after being shot. It did not identify her, but said \u201cthere is nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Gaza-based journalists in Hamas chat blocked from WhatsApp</p><p>GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 A few hours after the latest cease-fire took effect in the Gaza Strip, a number of Palestinian journalists in the coastal enclave found they were blocked from accessing WhatsApp messenger \u2014 a crucial tool used to communicate with sources, editors and the world beyond the blockaded strip.</p><p>The Associated Press reached out to 17 journalists in Gaza who confirmed their Whatsapp accounts had been blocked since Friday. By midday Monday, only four journalists \u2014 working for Al Jazeera \u2014 confirmed their accounts had been restored.</p><p>The incident marks the latest puzzling move concerning WhatsApp's owner Facebook Inc. that\u2019s left Palestinian users or their allies bewildered as to why they\u2019ve been targeted by the company, or if indeed they\u2019d been singled out for censorship at all.</p><p>Twelve of the 17 journalists contacted by the AP said they had been part of a WhatsApp group that disseminates information related to Hamas military operations. Hamas, which rules over the Gaza Strip, is viewed as a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States, where WhatsApp owner Facebook is headquartered.</p><p>It's unclear if the journalists were targeted because they\u2019d been following that group's announcements on WhatsApp.</p><p>___</p><p>AP: Top cop in Black man's deadly arrest withheld cam video</p><p>NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 In perhaps the strongest evidence yet of an attempted cover-up in the deadly 2019 arrest of Ronald Greene, the ranking Louisiana State Police officer at the scene falsely told internal investigators that the Black man was still a threat to flee after he was shackled, and he denied the existence of his own body camera video for nearly two years until it emerged just last month.</p><p>New state police documents obtained by The Associated Press show numerous inconsistencies between Lt. John Clary\u2019s statements to detectives and the body camera footage he denied having. They add to growing evidence of obfuscation in Greene\u2019s death, which the white troopers initially blamed on a car crash at the end of a high-speed chase and is now the subject of a federal civil rights investigation.</p><p>The highly secretive case has drawn national attention since last week, when the AP began publishing graphic body camera videos that showed troopers repeatedly jolting Greene with stun guns, putting him in a chokehold, punching him and dragging him by his ankle shackles. And like George Floyd's death a year ago, it once again highlighted the importance of video as key evidence in police misconduct cases.</p><p>\u201cVideo doesn't lie, and the best way to protect the integrity of law enforcement agencies is with body camera footage,\u201d said Rafael Goyeneche, a former prosecutor who is president of the Metropolitan Crime Commission, a New Orleans-based watchdog group.</p><p>But Clary, the highest-ranking officer among at least six state troopers at the scene of Greene's May 10, 2019, arrest, told investigators later that day that he had no body camera footage of the incident \u2014 a statement proven to be untrue when his 30-minute body camera video of the arrest emerged last month.</p><p>___</p><p>Grim western fire season starts much drier than record 2020</p><p>As bad as last year\u2019s record-shattering fire season was, the western U.S. starts this year\u2019s in even worse shape.</p><p>The soil in the West is record dry for this time of year. In much of the region, plants that fuel fires are also the driest scientists have seen. The vegetation is primed to ignite, especially in the Southwest where dead juniper trees are full of flammable needles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like having gasoline out there,\u201d said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona.</p><p>A climate change-fueled megadrought of more than 20 years is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists said. Rainfall in the Rockies and farther west was the second lowest on record in April, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>\u201cIt means that the dice are loaded toward a lot of forest fire this year,\u201d said Park Williams, a UCLA climate and fire scientist, who calculated that soil in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. \u201cThis summer we\u2019re going into fire season with drier fuels than we were at this time last year.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Malian soldiers take president, PM to military headquarters</p><p>BAMAKO, Mali (AP) \u2014 Malian soldiers rounded up the president and prime minister Monday, hours after a government reshuffle left out two members of the junta that seized power in a coup nine months earlier in the West African nation, witnesses reported.</p><p>There was no immediate confirmation as to why a meeting was abruptly called at the military headquarters in Kati, but it came just hours after the new Cabinet positions were announced, said to several witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of recrimination by the military.</p><p>The new Cabinet announced Monday afternoon did not include Interior Security Minister Modibo Kone or Defense Minister Sadio Camara. No reason was given for their exclusion, but the move suggested mounting divisions within the transitional government that is responsible for organizing new elections by next February.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy in Bamako, meanwhile, said it had received \u201creports of increased military activity in Bamako.\u201d It urged Americans in Bamako to limit their movements.</p><p>As the meeting at Kati carried on into the night, there was no immediate comment from transitional President Bah N\u2019Daw, a retired colonel major, nor from transitional Prime Minister Moctar Ouane.</p><p>___</p><p>Cosmic 2-for-1: Total lunar eclipse combines with supermoon</p><p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The first total lunar eclipse in more than two years coincides with a supermoon this week for quite a cosmic show.</p><p>This super \u201cblood\u201d moon will be visible Wednesday across the Pacific \u2014 offering the best viewing \u2014 as well as the western half of North America, bottom of South America and eastern Asia.</p><p>Better look quick: The total eclipse will last about 15 minutes as Earth passes directly between the moon and the sun. But the entire show will last five hours, as Earth's shadow gradually covers the moon, then starts to ebb. The reddish-orange color is the result of all the sunrises and sunsets in Earth\u2019s atmosphere projected onto the surface of the eclipsed moon.</p><p>\u201cHawaii has the best seat in the house and then short of that will be California and the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said NASA\u2019s Noah Petro, project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. New Zealand and Australia also will have prime viewing.</p><p>Circling the moon for 12 years, the orbiter will measure temperatures changes on the lunar surface during the eclipse. Telescopes atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Kea also will monitor the moon, Petro said.</p><p>___</p><p>Stephen Colbert says he's going back before live audiences</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In one more step toward a reopened entertainment world, CBS said Monday that Stephen Colbert's late-night show will return on June 14 to episodes with a full studio audience.</p><p>Audience members will have to provide proof that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19 before attending shows at New York's Ed Sullivan Theater. Face masks will be optional.</p><p>Since the COVID shutdown in March 2020, Colbert has produced 205 episodes without a live audience, taping his first monologue from the bathtub of his South Carolina home. In August, he moved to a small studio at the Sullivan Theater offices, usually only with the show's executive producer, stage manager and occasionally Colbert's wife watching.</p><p>Watching NBA playoff games and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d before audiences this past weekend was a reminder that those in attendance aren't just watching, they are participants in events that make a big difference for performers, said Bill Carter, executive producer of CNN's current documentary series, \u201cThe Story of Late Night.\u201d</p><p>Telling jokes into a void has been especially hard for late-night performers, who depend upon the rhythm of the audience's response to their material, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-7f3ff4ed3b248f636b32b46e9c76199c20210524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62RS-Y031-DYMD-63G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2175\"/><timeReceived>10:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 24, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The first five years of funding will come from the already-passed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but the full amount will need further appropriations from Congress. If you're in the mood for reading a government report, here's the 25-page plan,[2] with the lighthearted title \"Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A New Strategy for Protecting Communities and Improving Resilience in America's Forests.\" (PDF document.)  </p><p><br/>We'll let the New York Times do the summarizing:[3] The federal Agriculture Department said in a statement[4] that it would take measures to reduce the danger of catastrophic fires in dozens of spots in 11 Western states by thinning overgrown trees and using controlled burns to get rid of dead vegetation. The plan [...] would quadruple the government's land treatment efforts. 'It's the time to act,' Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said at a news briefing[5] on Tuesday, adding that the government needed to 'change the trajectory of our wildfires.' <br/>The plan would be carries out by the US Forest Service, which we always have to remind ourselves is part of the Agriculture Department, no matter how much our brain keeps insisting it should be part of the Interior (which does have the National Park Service). The goal is to help make forests more resilient and \"fire-adaptive\" in the face of climate change, which has led not only to droughts, but also to warmer air that dries out brush and makes it easier for fires to burn out of control. <br/>As the Times points out, the number of fires every year in the western US has remained fairly constant over the last decade, but the size and intensity of fires have become much worse. In addition to climate change, past forest management practices have also contributed to the increased danger of huge wildfire. For over a century, the goal was to extinguish every forest fire, which allowed dead vegetation to accumulate. All that stuff that would in the past have been burned in small fires has instead just sat and dried out, making fires more likely to become massive.  <br/>In a very stupid way, Donald Trump was partially close to right about the role of built-up vegetation, except he completely ignored the role of climate change in making the situation worse, and thought the solution was as simple as raking[6] the forests. As the Times 'splains, the Biden administration has decided[7] to use thinning and intentional burning to restore forests to conditions closer to those that existed in the past, when fire was a regular part of the forest life cycle and naturally removed some trees and dead underbrush. The plan is aimed at reducing the risk of catastrophic fires in 11 states: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, and South Dakota. <br/> The plan so far is only partly funded, to the tune of $3 billion,[8] through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed last fall. The Times reports that beyond that, A spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department said the department would spend $655 million every year on forest management for the first five years of the plan. That money would be added to $262 million that the U.S. Forest Service had already allocated to the task for this year. [...] To carry out the plan on 50 million acres of land would cost around $50 billion, the spokeswoman said. The government spent about $1.9 billion per year on wildfire suppression from 2016 to 2020. <br/>If the Forest Service can actually get the appropriations to pull off the ambitious program of thinning and controlled burns \u2014 which is far from certain \u2014 that could make fire seasons far more manageable. Seems like a good idea, since wildfires are now a threat not just for the summer and fall months, but year-round, as the record December 30 fires that wiped out suburbs[9] in Colorado demonstrated. The forest management efforts would be supplemented, the Agriculture Department says,[10] with \"investments in fire-adapted communities and work to address post-fire risks, recovery and reforestation.\"  <br/>And while $50 billion over 10 years sounds like a lot, it's probably worth noting that the costs of wildfires keep getting higher and higher. Western wildfires in 2020 alone led to insurers paying out between $7 billion and $13 billion in damages,[11] and that's just on homes, land, and other stuff that was actually insured. When you factor in all the indirect costs of wildfires, like people being dislocated and the long-term costs of health problems caused by the air pollution from massive fires, estimates start running into the hundreds of billions[12] of dollars.  <br/>In the Agriculture Department's press release on the plan, Vilsack emphasized the need for action to cut the risks of extreme wildfires, and to start doing it as soon as possible, since the damage from the largest wildfires has outpaced \"the scale of efforts to protect homes, communities and natural resources,\" and that's only going to keep getting worse with climate change. He emphasized the need for cooperation on the prevention effort between federal agencies, other jurisdictions, and private landowners.  <br/>Forest Service Chief Randy Moore (yes, \"chief\" is his actual title) added that the job is doable, but that we gotta actually do it: 'We already have the tools, the knowledge and the partnerships in place to begin this work in many of our national forests and grasslands, and now we have funding that will allow us to build on the research and the lessons learned to address this wildfire crisis facing many of our communities,' said Moore. Vilsack also said at Tuesday's press conference[13] that the goal here isn't to eliminate wildfires, but to prevent them from being as catastrophic as the fires of the last decade.  <br/>Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona), who also spoke at the presser, said the emphasis on prevention and risk reduction is especially needed because of climate change, because \"We can't keep doing the same thing under worse conditions and expect a better result.\" <br/>And somewhere in Florida, Donald Trump mused about having an underling bring him a rake so he could go on TV and say 'Even Wonkette says I was right!\" But then he wanted a Big Mac and a Diet Coke and forgot all about it.  <br/>[NYT[14] / USDA [15]/ US Forest Service[16] / Photo: Brody Hessin[17] on Twitter,[18] Creative Commons License 4.0[19]] <br/>Yr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

The Shawnee Fire Management Team, the Archaeological Investigations Team and River to River Trail Team all are being honored. The Regional Forester will recognize the honorees at a virtual presentation on Feb. </p><p>5, 2020. \"These accomplishments show the dedication, innovation, and commitment of our employees and partners and are proof of the valuable work being done across the forest and in southern Illinois,\" said acting Forest Supervisor Ann Niesen. * The Shawnee Fire Management Team award is for strengthening the stewardship of private lands through technology and research. Recognizing the importance of returning fire to a fire-adapted landscape, the fire management team proactively developed a strategy to plan and implement prescribed fires that involved neighbors and partners. The Shawnee Resource Conservancy and Development, Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Southern Illinois Prescribed Burn Association, The Nature Conservancy and the Shawnee National Forest Service have worked across boundaries to form strong relationships and efficiently and effectively returned fire to the southern Illinois landscape. In FY 2019, the Shawnee National Forest fire management program and its partners successfully completed a record 14,000 acres of prescribed fire on National Forest System and nonfederal lands in southern Illinois. * Shawnee National Forest archaeologists and collaborators from Southern Illinois University won their award for facilitating rural prosperity and economic development. Local high school students worked alongside Forest Service employees, college students and instructors during a two-week field school at Miller Grove, a pre-Civil war community founded by freed African Americans. The end project for the students was the development of a story map incorporating film footage, primary source materials and artifacts into a detailed diary of their learning journey at Miller Grove. * The River to River Trail Society, Shawnee Trail Conservancy, Friends of the Shawnee National Forest and the Shawnee National Forest earned an award for fostering productive and sustainable use of National Forest System lands. The team significantly contributed to successful management of the River to River Trail through innovative, collaborative partnerships. The hard work of River to River Trail Society, Shawnee Trail Conservancy, Friends of the Shawnee National Forest and the Shawnee National Forest and partners resulted in maintenance and improvements that protect nearby water sources and improve visitor experience on the trail.

Brazil has been criticized over large-scale deforestation and fires that ravage the world's largest rainforest during the dry season Photo: AFP / CARL DE SOUZA Despite the military presence, however, INPE data shows an increase in deforestation for each month since January, compared to the same period last year.Last month, investment funds from Europe, Asia and South America that collectively manage nearly $4 billion demanded in an open letter that Bolsonaro stop projects that threaten to accelerate the destruction of the planet's largest rainforest.Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who heads Brazil's National Council for the Amazon, said international investors want Brazil to show \"results\" in fighting deforestation before they will consider participating in environmental protection projects in the country.\"It's not true that we're destroying the jungle to produce food,\" he said, also denying that Brazil was dismantling the state's environmental protection structure.Mourao spoke on Thursday with representatives of nine of the investment funds and will meet on Friday with businessmen who equally expressed concern about a policy that is damaging Brazil's international image.Sending the army to the region in May \"was exactly a sign that Brazil cares about the Amazon,\" Defense Ministry spokesman Vice Admiral Carlos Chagas said.Bolsonaro has shown little concern for the environment and repeatedly indicated his intention to open up indigenous territories and nature reserves to mining and agriculture.Non-governmental organizations point out that the right-wing government's discourse in favor of the Amazon's commercial exploitation contradicts the military mission of inspection and prevention.\"The outlook cannot be to control deforestation with a huge military operation. What we are seeing is pressure from the private sector for a different plan for the Amazon,\" said Napolitano. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159439954523225876100230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B2-X2X1-JCMN-Y4GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><timeReceived>4:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

But while some fires in some places might be beneficial, the wholesale torching of the forests of the American West right now is far from beneficial overall\u2014not to mention a sure sign that our profligate ways with carbon emissions are coming back to haunt us.On the plus side, forest fire does clear away the tinder-like overgrown understory that has resulted from years of forest management that avoided fire at all cost. </p><p>Hundreds of years ago, many of the forests now on fire in California, Oregon and Washington had fewer yet larger and healthier trees. But these days, partly thanks to fire suppression regimes as well as other factors, forests are more crowded today with smaller, less healthy trees. It's also harder for those remaining mature, established trees to compete for nutrients and space with all the undergrowth that's built up in recent decades. In these situations, small manageable fires (or even better, prescribed burns) cannot only be beneficial, but can help prevent larger fires down the road by clearing the weaker, smaller trees. Please get our new book \"It's Worth It: How to Talk To Your Right-Wing Relatives, Friends, and Neighbors[1]\" today knowing you (1) Get communication techniques &amp;#38; (2) Support Progressive message delivery. Another benefit of wildfire is the clearing of overgrown underbrush to make room for new grasses, herbs and regenerated shrubs that provide food and habitat for many wildlife species. Also, the removal of thick stands of shrubs increases the water supply for the remaining larger plants and trees\u2014and also allows streams and rivers to swell, further benefiting ever-thirsty native flora and fauna.Yet another benefit of fire is that it kills off fungi, bacteria, viruses and insects that can decimate tree and plant communities and entire forest ecosystems. According to CalFire, California's statewide wildfire management agency, more trees die from insect infestation and disease than from wildfire; some fire actually helps keep forests devoid of such pests and healthier overall than without fire. CalFire points out that vegetation burned by wildfire provides a rich source of nutrients that nourish surviving trees and soil.And periodic fire can be an important way to keep certain ecosystems in balance. Many trees have evolved with fire and some even require it for seed germination; a few species even sport leaves covered with flammable resins (manzanita, scrub oak, chamise) to encourage fires that help seed the next generation.National Geographic reports that, surprisingly, wildlife casualties tend to be low during wildfire events, as animals\u2014especially those native to the areas on-fire and evolved to respond to the threat\u2014either burrow in the ground or flee to safer areas instinctively. But invasive plants and animals may not fare as well given lack of genetic imprinting to be on alert for the threat.Once the smoke clears on 2020's horrific fire season, mass human and wildlife casualties could be the new normal.

With a collective $70 billion in FRF remaining,/1 states can use these funds to build healthier, more equitable, climate-resilient communities. Sixteen states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have allocated a combined $2.1 billion of their FRF toward environmental initiatives,/2 including cleanups of industrial pollution and preservation of natural habitats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change and other environmental challenges pose a serious risk to people's health and well-being, especially those with low incomes and communities of color. Some state and local governments are confronting these challenges head-on, using Fiscal Recovery Funds to invest in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency, stem pollution, clean up environmental hazards, and mitigate or reduce harm to habitats from a variety of sources. States are actively monitoring environmental needs and changes to preemptively mitigate the consequences of climate change, which can result in costly remediation and long-term health effects./3 States also can protect and restore the natural environment by mitigating and reversing harm to habitats through solar or wind energy projects.</p><p>Additional environmental spending should be targeted to those who routinely experience disproportionate harm from environmental challenges and other crises, such as recessions and public health emergencies. Individuals and households with low incomes and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) -- who have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic -- also have been the most impacted by climate change and industrial pollution./4 Thus, targeting FRF to environmental investments can be part of an equitable, antiracist pandemic recovery.</p><p>State Investments Can Advance Environmental Justice</p><p>Environmental justice policies and practices aim to reduce or eliminate environmental harm under the guidance of communities that experience climate change's consequences firsthand. Communities with low incomes and Black and brown communities disproportionately face many of these impacts, such as community displacement, geographic deterioration, and agricultural disruption./5 For example, individuals with low incomes are likelier to live in homes that are more vulnerable to natural disasters and experience property damage, homelessness, and physical and financial impacts./6 States, localities, and families are often left to cover these aftermath expenses./7</p><p>Targeting environmental investments to people with low incomes and communities of color is critical to redressing past injustices and advancing racial equity. Harmful environmental policies and regulations are often rooted in systemic racism and other forms of oppression./8 For example, policymakers and private industrial interests in Louisiana have since the mid-1800s concentrated petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River in predominantly Black communities, which increases the rate of cancer and respiratory illnesses, and high pollution levels prevent residents from selling their homes./9 State investments in policies to improve environmental conditions can help build more equitable communities, advancing environmental justice nationwide.</p><p>Fiscal Recovery Funds Support Range of Environmental Initiatives</p><p>The Fiscal Recovery Funds present a historic opportunity for states and localities to fund transformative, long-term investments in the environment, with a focus on communities that have been most severely impacted by pollution, climate change, and natural disasters. The following are examples of climate-related investments states and localities are making.</p><p>Energy Efficiency</p><p>Energy efficiency investments are a cost-effective approach to fighting climate change and to helping households with low incomes afford energy bills. Households with low incomes typically pay about 13.9 percent of their income in energy costs, compared to 3 percent for other households, a 2020 study found./10 Weatherization, electrification, and solar initiatives can reduce energy costs and pollution's harmful effects. For instance, electrification replaces fossil fuels such as propane, heating oil, and gasoline to provide cleaner air while helping homes to reduce their overall emissions and energy bills.</p><p>* D.C. invested $8.2 million in grant funding for senior care facilities, hospitals, K-12 schools, universities, and hospitals to conduct energy audits, and $11 million toward the D.C. Green Bank's/11 clean energy projects -- such as stormwater infrastructure, low-cost solar energy, and LED lighting for efficient energy use -- to help D.C. reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption./12 The District also allocated $17 million for community solar projects, which allow people who live in apartments or have roofs that cannot support solar to invest in off-site solar panels and receive a credit on their monthly electricity bill for the energy they generate.</p><p>* Maine appropriated $50 million in funding to award grants to accelerate weatherization and home efficiency upgrades, particularly for residents with low incomes. Schools, municipalities, and community organizations can also secure these grants by providing matching funds to support energy efficiency measures.</p><p>* Maryland used $30 million for its Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which provides funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation projects. In 2019, the program/13 funded residential and commercial projects such as solar canopies (elevated structures that host solar panels and provide shade) and geothermal heating and cooling systems, using an underground system to convert and transfer heat between buildings and the ground.</p><p>* Massachusetts appropriated $3.3 million to pilot a geothermal technology program./14 It also allocated over $16 million for the Greening Cities Program/15 to reduce households' heating and cooling energy use by increasing tree canopies.</p><p>Industrial Pollution and Fossil Fuels</p><p>Industrial operations degrade the environment -- including polluting the air, drinking water, and soil -- and emissions from burning fossil fuels are a persistent concern. A few states are addressing the harmful consequences of industrial waste and fossil fuels in their communities.</p><p>* Florida appropriated $50 million to clean up petroleum tanks./16 At the beginning of 2018, there were an estimated 19,000 underground petroleum storage tanks that served no use and were potentially leaking into the state's drinking water./17</p><p>* New Mexico used $3.5 million to implement a program to identify oil and natural gas wells that energy extraction companies have abandoned and failed to plug. The state has 708 such wells, with an estimated $24 million cleanup cost, which, left unaddressed, would lead to contaminated water and methane air pollution./18</p><p>* Vermont invested $11 million in the Brownfields Program/19 to identify former industrial properties, manufacturing facilities, vacant land, office spaces, and gas stations that may be contaminated or have harmful pollutants. Brownfields' redevelopment reduces health and safety hazards while creating opportunities for quality housing, recreation space, and economic development./20</p><p>Preservation of Local Habitats</p><p>To develop resilient, healthy communities and help maintain local ecosystems and protect threatened native habits, some states and territories are increasing FRF spending to actively monitor environmental changes and create effective mitigation plans.</p><p>* Florida allocated $100 million to strengthen coastal mapping efforts in collaboration with coastal communities to develop resiliency against flooding, erosion, and habitat changes. Coastal mapping includes gathering seafloor data for mapping habitats, restoration projects, resource management, emergency response, and hazard studies.</p><p>* Hawai'i appropriated $2.5 million to the agency charged with enforcing protections for historic sites, state parks, forest reserves, wildlife, marine life, and other natural resources./21</p><p>* Puerto Rico invested $10 million in environmental conservation initiatives, including protecting endangered species and ecosystems.</p><p>Research Studies to Assess Environmental Needs</p><p>A few states are using modest amounts of FRF to explore research for environmental needs. This can allow communities to assess environmental needs prior to undertaking larger environmental programs and policies. For example, some states are exploring and investing in offshore wind projects,/22 which have the potential to deliver large amounts of clean, renewable energy but also require strategic planning prior to developing the infrastructure./23</p><p>* Connecticut used $20,000 to study air quality in the town of Sherman, citing the impact of social, environmental, and economic conditions on health outcomes.</p><p>* New Hampshire appropriated $250,000 for a study to assess the potential impacts of developing/24 offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine.</p><p>* Texas allocated $300,000 to analyze the Coastal Texas Study/25 and assess the feasibility of constructing a coastal storm risk management and ecosystem restoration.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1/ This report reflects data collected by CBPP on state uses of Fiscal Recovery Funds. It relies in part on extensive Fiscal Recovery Fund tracking conducted by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p><p>2/ This total includes FRF weatherization investments, which CBPP also categorized under housing repairs, but excludes $9.8 billion in water and sewer infrastructure spending for all states, D.C., and the U.S. Territories.</p><p>3/ Hurricanes Ida and Sandy represent two examples of the danger and fiscal costs that severe storms, which are expected to become more common due to climate change, pose to communities.

Martha McSally, R-Arizona, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Martha McSally (R-AZ) this week introduced a bill to restore Arizona's forests by incentivizing the removal of dangerous overgrowth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Forest Health and Biomass Energy Act would advance forest restoration by incentivizing biomass energy development as a method to reduce hazardous fuel build-up in fire-prone forests.</p><p>During a U.S. SenateSubcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining yesterday, McSally discussed her new bill and the catastrophic wildfires raging across the West.</p><p>\"One of the biggest challenges we've had in forest restoration in Arizona is the crushing expense of removing low-value biomass like branches, slash, and undergrowth from the forest,\" McSally said. \"That's why this week I'm introducing my bill, the Forest Health and Biomass Energy Act. My bill will accelerate forest restoration by reducing the cost and regulatory barriers to clearing out dangerous overgrowth and utilizing that material for carbon neutral biomass electricity. My bill complements the forest management policies included in the Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act, which I've cosponsored with Senator Daines and we're considering in the hearing today. Together, our bills offer practical, cost-effective solutions to target the real root causes of these catastrophic wildfires while also supporting low carbon energy.\"</p><p>During the hearing, McSally called out the U.S. Forest Service for delaying Arizona's single most important forest fire prevention project--the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI).</p><p>\"While I am glad to see the Forest Service adopted many of the proposals in my [2019] bill, more work needs to be done to make 4FRI a success and reduce wildfire risk. Unfortunately, 4FRI has encountered delay after delay. And even though this is the single most important project underway to reduce the risk of wildfire in Arizona, the Forest Service recently pushed back Phase 2 even further.
