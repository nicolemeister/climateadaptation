But in a split second Friday, the festive gathering in northern Israel turned into one of the country's worst-ever tragedies, with at least 45 people crushed to death and dozens injured in a stampede.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The disaster prompted a national outpouring of grief as devastated families rushed to identify their dead relatives and bury them ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. There was also anger toward authorities over an accident that experts had long feared, further clouding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hopes of remaining in office.</p><p>Netanyahu, who briefly visited Mount Meron at midday, offered his condolences. \"In these moments our people unite and that is what we are doing at this moment as well,\" he said.</p><p>He announced Sunday would be a day of national mourning and said he had joined the masses of people who donated blood for the victims. Israel's President Reuven Rivlin lit 45 candles in honor of the dead. Messages of condolences poured in from around the world.</p><p>The stampede erupted around 1a.m. as people began to leave and thronged a narrow, tunnel-like passage. According to witnesses, people began to fall on a slippery ramp, causing others to trip and sparking panic.</p><p>Video footage from the scene of the disaster showed large numbers of people, most of them black-clad ultra-Orthodox men, squeezed in the tunnel. Witnesses complained that police barricades had prevented people from exiting properly.</p><p>At least 45 people were killed, according to the Israeli Health Ministry, with four people remaining in critical condition and dozens more hospitalized.</p><p>Bodies were later taken to Israel's central forensic institute for identification, where distraught families waited to identify their loved ones. Israel's Army Radio said some 40 people remained unaccounted for.</p><p>In a race against time, a number of funerals were held before sundown Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath when burials do not take place.</p><p>The death toll at Mount Meron exceeded the 44 people killed in a 2010 forest fire, previously believed to be Israel's deadliest civilian tragedy.</p><p>The Justice Ministry said the police were launching a probe into possible criminal misconduct by officers.</p><p>Experts have long warned that the Mount Meron celebrations were ripe for disaster due to the crowded conditions, large fires and hot weather. In a 2008 report, the state comptroller, a watchdog government office, warned conditions at the site, including escape routes, \"endanger the public.\"</p><p>Last year, the celebrations were greatly scaled back due to coronavirus restrictions. But this year's event marked the first religious gathering to be held legally since Israel lifted most restrictions in the wake of its successful vaccination program.</p><p>According to Health Ministry guidelines, public gatherings continue to be limited to no more than 500 people. But Israeli media said that Netanyahu assured ultra-Orthodox leaders that the celebrations would take place, despite objections from public health officials. Netanyahu's office did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The deadly stampede was bound to have political reverberations at a time of great uncertainty following an inconclusive March election, the fourth in two years.</p><p>Netanyahu has so far been unsuccessful in forming a governing coalition. His time to do so runs out on Tuesday. If he fails, his political rivals will get a chance to try to cobble together an alliance.</p><p>Netanyahu has long relied on powerful ultra-Orthodox parties as allies and will need their support if he wants to keep faint hopes alive of staying in power.</p><p>During Friday's visit to Mount Meron, Netanyahu was jeered by dozens of religious protesters. If such sentiments spread, it could further hurt Netanyahu's prospects.</p><p>The stampede also threatened to deepen a broad public backlash against the ultra-Orthodox.</p><p>Netanyahu came under heavy criticism over the past year for allowing ultra-Orthodox communities to flout safety guidelines by opening schools and synagogues and holding mass funerals. The ultra-Orthodox communities were among the country's hardest hit by COVID-19.</p><p>Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University and fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, said the coming days would see a battle over \"framing\" of the event. Netanyahu will call for national healing and unity, while his opponents will say he is unfit to remain in office and its time for change.</p><p>\"There is a battle on the framing, who is to blame, not to blame,\" he said. \"Already we see the signs of it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4611225</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KH-84X1-DYWP-80SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

For starters, a sky brilliantly colored by the sun with oranges and reds, mountains deep in blue and purple shadows with water reflecting the majestic beauty. Then, add the black silhouette of a power pole and electrical lines inserting horizontal and vertical lines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or maybe a teakettle atop a wood-burning stove. Heat-generated flames can be seen through the stove's glass door as steam pours from the kettle's spout, suggesting, perhaps, a cup of tea to be brewed. As the stove's chimney rises, it transforms into the trunk of a paper-barked, leafless birch tree.</p><p>It is in that tug of man and nature, pushing and pulling, where Homer artist Jenna Gerrety finds her inspiration \"and how it affects our cycles of regeneration,\" she writes in the artist statement accompanying her paintings being shown being at Grace Ridge Brewing Company through the month of June, as well as at Sustainable Wares.</p><p>At the age of 5, Gerrety and her family relocated from Homer to Anchorage after her father found work with an airplane mechanic company and the family tired of the 250-plus mile commute. They returned often, however, deepening Gerrety's love of the area and a yearning to return to the southern Kenai Peninsula for good.</p><p>After high school, she enrolled at the University of Alaska Anchorage with her mind set on becoming a virologist, a career that undoubtedly would have had her busy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"It occurred to me what fun I would be having right now,\" she said, laughing at the path her life might have taken had she not enrolled in a painting class.</p><p>Her first class wasn't a positive experience. Disliking the instructor's teaching style and approach to art didn't sit well with Gerrety. Rather than be discouraged, however, Gerrety's anger with how and what she was being taught had the opposite effect.</p><p>\"I said, 'I will do better than you,'\" recalled Gerrety of the instructor and resulting decision to pursue painting.</p><p>She enrolled in a class with Alutiiq painter Alvin Eli Amason and found the inspiration she was looking for. Amason's work has been in shows across the world, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Heart Museum, and his paintings can be seen by anyone passing through the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport or in the U.S. Federal Courthouse Building in Anchorage.</p><p>Gerrety enjoys drawing, but it is in painting where she expresses her love of color, playing with it, deciding which colors look good together and discovering new and better materials. For instance, one paint she uses often is \"Easy Klein Blue,\" a close approximation of \"International Klein Blue\" created by the French artist Yves Klein. With Parisian art paint supplier Edouard Adam, Klein used synthetic resin to produce an intense blue that, because Klein registered the method, could not be used by other artists. Another example is the lock artist Anish Kapoor had on Vantablack, the world's blackest black material. British artist Stuart Semple has opened the door to those and other \"banned\" colors, by creating methods for producing close similarities.</p><p>In terms of subject, Gerrety said, \"One of the things I have been fascinated about the Kenai Peninsula is that you can go pretty much anywhere into the woods, and you'll find old cars, car parts, random stuff.\"</p><p>That was the theme of her thesis, \"Presence of Dystopia,\" in which she took \"things that are clearly signs that something is not well in society and highlighted them in a beautiful way. \u2026 How cool is the orange band of light seen through (forest fire) smoke? It's very pretty, but the road is closed because you can't drive through when there's a fire,\" said Gerrety. \"It's a duality, reminding people that there is some beauty in destruction, but it exists and is right in front of you.\"</p><p>Depicting the duality in a delicate and beautiful way \"can inspire more dialogue and less blaming or recriminations for things that aren't really under the average person's control, but need to be discussed or thought about,\" Gerrety said. Leaving Anchorage and returning to Homer was something that didn't take much discussion or thinking.</p><p>\"I've always loved the drive coming into town, seeing the mountains open up in front of you,\" said Gerrety, who, in 2019, settled on family property on Diamond Ridge, near her grandparents. \"You just see the sunrises and sunsets, and it's the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen.\"</p><p>She is currently working at the Spotted Fox Tattoo Company, tracing stencils. When an opportunity opened up to exhibit her art at Grace Ridge, Gerrety jumped at the chance. Her paintings, as well as stickers, magnets and origami she's created are also available at Sustainable Wares.</p><p>Where does she see her art going?</p><p>\"Into people's homes,\" she is quick to reply with a laugh. \"I would love to make a living painting, but if not, maybe I'll go back to school and become a virologist.\"</p><p>One thing is certain, however. \"I'm not leaving Homer,\" Gerrety said.</p><p>On Instagram, Gerrety can be contacted @djamor.art.</p><p>McKibben Jackinsky is a freelance writer living in Homer.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Peninsula Clarion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PENCLA-news20210616PYN4172666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PENCLA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y1-CWG1-F0HF-82DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

In the United States, New Orleans and many tourism cities along the Gulf Coast were devastated by one of the world's worse hurricanes.</p><p>In the west, forest fires closed down parts of world-famous Lake Tahoe.</p><p>Other parts of the world also suffered In Europe Greece saw its worst forest fire season, and many European nations suffered from severe flooding.</p><p>These climatic events ought to be a wake-up call to everyone in the tourism industry. Mother nature has made it abundantly clear that travel &amp; tourism is a very fragile industry. It is an industry that is often weather dependent.</p><p>Often, tourism economies and profits are at the mercy of natural events. For example, Central America and the Caribbean are often at the mercy of the hurricane season. In the Pacific region, these vast ocean induced storms, often called typhoons, are equally as deadly. In other parts of the word, there are draughts and floods, earthquakes and tsunamis and these so-called natural disasters can do untold damage to a tourism industry. After a natural disaster for many in the tourism industry, recovery is painfully slow and with businesses facing bankruptcies and people losing jobs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic many businesses are less able than before to recover easily from a natural disaster. Unfortunately, we cannot control the weather or climatic conditions, but it is a good idea to prepare for earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes/typhoons or forest fires before they happen.</p><p>To help you prepare I offer the following suggestions.</p><p>-Develop plans before the disasters occur. Waiting until a hurricane strikes is too late to begin to act. Develop a pre-emergency plan. This plan should be multi-faceted and should include caring for those who may be hurt or sick during the calamity, finding shelters for visitors, determining who is and is not staying at hotels, creating communication centers.</p><p>-Think about a recovery business plan and marketing plan before disaster strikes. Once you are in the midst of a natural disaster you will be too busy to develop a well throughout recovery plan. Take the time to plan when things are less chaotic and you have the patience and time to interact with others such as fire departments, police departments, health officials, and experts in emergency management. Get to know these people by name and make sure that they know who you are.</p><p>-Create good working relationships between private businesses and government agencies. Before a disaster strikes, make sure to know the names government officials to whom you may need to turn to. Go over your plans with these people and get their input prior to the crisis.</p><p>-Do not forget that disasters are often opportunities for crime. Make sure that the police department is part of the disaster plan, not only from the perspective of law enforcement but also from the perspective of public relations and economic recovery. What your police department says and how it acts toward visitors may impact your recovery and local tourism industry for years to come.</p><p>-Develop good communication between first responder agencies. Many tourism professionals simply assume that there are good working relationships between various federal, state, provincial or local disaster management agencies. Often this is not the case. Interagency noncooperation reflects poorly on your tourism business or community. For example, Furthermore, most police agencies are not trained in tourism-oriented policing and have no idea as to how to handle the special needs of the tourism industry during times of crisis.</p><p>-Develop a protocol for addressing classified information. For example, in case of emergency, will hotels cooperate on allowing the names of guests to be released? If so, under what circumstances? When should health records be released and what is the responsibility of the local tourism industry regarding privacy versus public health issues?</p><p>-Develop security clearance protocols. During times of the disasters, all sorts of legal clearances may be needed. Once the disaster has occurred, it is too late to begin to sort out legal issues. Develop a list now and obtain the necessary clearances during periods of calm. In a like manner, go over with your public health people what policies will be in place if a policy of triage should have to be implemented.</p><p>-In this ongoing pandemic world, it is essential that local tourism agencies develop visitor public health policies and publicize them. In case of flooding, earthquakes or other natural disasters all sorts of new problems may arise. Visitors may have lost medication and not be able to obtain replacements, some people may not want particular medical problems to become part of the public record. Visitors will have higher levels of anxiety than if they had been at home and we may expect to see greater levels of stress-induced medical problems.</p><p>-Know or have a plan if your tourism industry covers a regional or multi-jurisdictional area. Whenever possible, develop a code of conduct and a working relationship between agencies, hotels, restaurants, emergency shelters, and other relief agencies that cross city, county, provincial or state boundaries.</p><p>-Make sure that you have good toll-free telephone or Internet service and publicize where visitors can go to use these services in case of blackouts. Visitors will want to call out and their loved ones will want to call them. As soon as possible, establish some form of free communication. Visitors will never forget this act of hospitality.</p><p>-Begin long-term tourism recovery programs immediately. These long-term programs should go far beyond simply marketing the area or providing lower prices. The program should also include such things as working with mental health professionals and establishing support facilities for visitors who happen to be survivors. When the visitor leaves the impacted area, he/she will continue to suffer from the natural disaster.

For starters, a sky brilliantly colored by the sun with oranges and reds, mountains deep in blue and purple shadows with water reflecting the majestic beauty. Then, add the black silhouette of a power pole and electrical lines inserting horizontal and vertical lines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or maybe a teakettle atop a wood-burning stove. Heat-generated flames can be seen through the stove's glass door as steam pours from the kettle's spout, suggesting, perhaps, a cup of tea to be brewed. As the stove's chimney rises, it transforms into the trunk of a paper-barked, leafless birch tree.</p><p>It is in that tug of man and nature, pushing and pulling, where Homer artist Jenna Gerrety finds her inspiration \"and how it affects our cycles of regeneration,\" she writes in the artist statement accompanying her paintings being shown being at Grace Ridge Brewing Company through the month of June, as well as at Sustainable Wares.</p><p>At the age of 5, Gerrety and her family relocated from Homer to Anchorage after her father found work with an airplane mechanic company and the family tired of the 250-plus mile commute. They returned often, however, deepening Gerrety's love of the area and a yearning to return to the southern Kenai Peninsula for good.</p><p>After high school, she enrolled at the University of Alaska Anchorage with her mind set on becoming a virologist, a career that undoubtedly would have had her busy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"It occurred to me what fun I would be having right now,\" she said, laughing at the path her life might have taken had she not enrolled in a painting class.</p><p>Her first class wasn't a positive experience. Disliking the instructor's teaching style and approach to art didn't sit well with Gerrety. Rather than be discouraged, however, Gerrety's anger with how and what she was being taught had the opposite effect.</p><p>\"I said, 'I will do better than you,'\" recalled Gerrety of the instructor and resulting decision to pursue painting.</p><p>She enrolled in a class with Alutiiq painter Alvin Eli Amason and found the inspiration she was looking for. Amason's work has been in shows across the world, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Heart Museum, and his paintings can be seen by anyone passing through the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport or in the U.S. Federal Courthouse Building in Anchorage.</p><p>Gerrety enjoys drawing, but it is in painting where she expresses her love of color, playing with it, deciding which colors look good together and discovering new and better materials. For instance, one paint she uses often is \"Easy Klein Blue,\" a close approximation of \"International Klein Blue\" created by the French artist Yves Klein. With Parisian art paint supplier Edouard Adam, Klein used synthetic resin to produce an intense blue that, because Klein registered the method, could not be used by other artists. Another example is the lock artist Anish Kapoor had on Vantablack, the world's blackest black material. British artist Stuart Semple has opened the door to those and other \"banned\" colors, by creating methods for producing close similarities.</p><p>In terms of subject, Gerrety said, \"One of the things I have been fascinated about the Kenai Peninsula is that you can go pretty much anywhere into the woods, and you'll find old cars, car parts, random stuff.\"</p><p>That was the theme of her thesis, \"Presence of Dystopia,\" in which she took \"things that are clearly signs that something is not well in society and highlighted them in a beautiful way. \u2026 How cool is the orange band of light seen through (forest fire) smoke? It's very pretty, but the road is closed because you can't drive through when there's a fire,\" said Gerrety. \"It's a duality, reminding people that there is some beauty in destruction, but it exists and is right in front of you.\"</p><p>Depicting the duality in a delicate and beautiful way \"can inspire more dialogue and less blaming or recriminations for things that aren't really under the average person's control, but need to be discussed or thought about,\" Gerrety said. Leaving Anchorage and returning to Homer was something that didn't take much discussion or thinking.</p><p>\"I've always loved the drive coming into town, seeing the mountains open up in front of you,\" said Gerrety, who, in 2019, settled on family property on Diamond Ridge, near her grandparents. \"You just see the sunrises and sunsets, and it's the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen.\"</p><p>She is currently working at the Spotted Fox Tattoo Company, tracing stencils. When an opportunity opened up to exhibit her art at Grace Ridge, Gerrety jumped at the chance. Her paintings, as well as stickers, magnets and origami she's created are also available at Sustainable Wares.</p><p>Where does she see her art going?</p><p>\"Into people's homes,\" she is quick to reply with a laugh. \"I would love to make a living painting, but if not, maybe I'll go back to school and become a virologist.\"</p><p>One thing is certain, however. \"I'm not leaving Homer,\" Gerrety said.</p><p>On Instagram, Gerrety can be contacted @djamor.art.</p><p>McKibben Jackinsky is a freelance writer living in Homer.</p><p>Copyright 2021 Homer News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOMNWS-news20210616PYL4172995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOMNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62Y1-CWG1-F0HF-82CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The musicians of the Maxwell Street Klezmer Band, complete with full drum set and brass section, were starting to play atop a flatbed trailer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then came the sound that Shapiro knew did not fit: pop pop pop pop pop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before he knew what was happening, parade-goers from farther down the route began running toward the 47-year-old and his family, screaming about someone with a gun.</p><p>\u201cIt was chaos,\u201d Shapiro recalled. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t know right away where the gunfire was coming from, whether the gunman was in front or behind you chasing you.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>In major blow, 2 key ministers quit Boris Johnson government</p><p>LONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was clinging to power Tuesday after two of his most senior Cabinet ministers quit, saying they had lost confidence in Johnson\u2019s leadership amid shifting explanations about his handling of a sexual misconduct scandal.</p><p>Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid resigned within minutes of each other, costing Johnson the support of the men responsible for tackling two of the biggest issues facing Britain \u2014 the cost-of-living crisis and surging COVID-19 infections.</p><p>Both cited Johnson\u2019s credibility after a day in which the prime minister was forced to backtrack on earlier statements about the scandal that has rattled his government for the past six days.</p><p>The debacle is only the latest to hit Johnson, who last month narrowly survived a vote of no confidence triggered by similarly shifting stories about lockdown-breaking parties in government offices.</p><p>In his letter of resignation, Javid said the confidence vote showed a large number of Conservative Party lawmakers had lost trust in Johnson.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge won\u2019t block law banning most Mississippi abortions</p><p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 As attorneys argued about abortion laws across the South on Tuesday, a Mississippi judge rejected a request by the state\u2019s only abortion clinic to temporarily block a law that would ban most abortions.</p><p>Without other developments in the Mississippi lawsuit, the clinic will close at the end of business Wednesday and the state law will take effect Thursday.</p><p>One of the clinic's attorneys, Hillary Schneller of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the judge should have blocked the law.</p><p>\u201cPeople in Mississippi who need abortions right now are in a state of panic, trying to get into the clinic before it\u2019s too late,\" Schneller said. \"No one should be forced to live in fear like that.\u201d</p><p>Mississippi legislators passed the \u201ctrigger\u201d law before the U.S. Supreme Court recently overturned the 1973 Roe v.

The clinic, JacksonWomen's Health Organization, sought a temporary restraining order that would have allowed it to remain open while the lawsuit played out in court.</p><p>___</p><p>Parade shooting suspect bought 5 weapons despite threats</p><p>HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) \u2014 A man charged Tuesday with seven counts of murder after firing off more than 70 rounds at an Independence Day parade in suburban Chicago legally bought five weapons, including the high-powered rifle used in the shooting, despite authorities being called to his home twice in 2019 for threats of violence and suicide, police said.</p><p>Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Eric Rinehart said the suspect, if convicted of the first-degree murder charges, would receive a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. He promised that dozens more charges would be sought.</p><p>A spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force said the suspected shooter, who was arrested late Monday, used a rifle \u201csimilar to an AR-15\" to spray more than 70 rounds from atop a commercial building into a crowd that had gathered for the parade in Highland Park, an affluent community of about 30,000 on the Lake Michigan shore.</p><p>A seventh victim died of their injuries Tuesday. More than three dozen other people were wounded in the attack, which Task force spokesman Christopher Covelli said the suspect had planned for several weeks.</p><p>The assault happened less than three years after police went to the suspect's home following a call from a family member who said he was threatening \u201cto kill everyone\u201d there. Covelli said police confiscated 16 knives, a dagger and a sword, but said there was no sign he had any guns at the time, in September 2019.</p><p>___</p><p>Ukrainian governor urges evacuation of 350,000 residents</p><p>KRAMATORSK, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 The governor of the last remaining eastern province partly under Ukraine's control urged his more than 350,000 residents to flee as Russia escalated its offensive and air alerts were issued across nearly the entire country.</p><p>Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that getting people out of Donetsk province is necessary to save lives and enable the Ukrainian army better to defend towns from the Russian advance.</p><p>\u201cThe destiny of the whole country will be decided by the Donetsk region,\u201d Kyrylenko told reporters in Kramatrosk, the province's administrative center and home to the Ukrainian military's regional headquarters.</p><p>\u201cOnce there are less people, we will be able to concentrate more on our enemy and perform our main tasks,\u201d Kyrylenko said.</p><p>The governor\u2019s call for residents to leave appeared to represent one of the biggest suggested evacuations of the war, although it's unclear whether people will be willing and safely able to flee. According to the U.N. refugee agency, more than 7.1 million Ukrainians are estimated to be displaced within Ukraine, and more than 4.8 million refugees left the country since Russia's invasion started Feb. 24.</p><p>___</p><p>A survivor of the migrant trailer: 'They couldn't breathe'</p><p>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) \u2014 Simple advice from a friend to stay near the door may have saved Yenifer Yulisa Cardona Tom\u00e1s from the deadly fate that befell 53 other migrants when they were abandoned trapped in a sweltering semi-trailer last week on the edge of San Antonio.</p><p>Speaking by phone from her hospital bed Monday, the 20-year-old from Guatemala\u2019s capital said it was already hot on June 27 when she stepped out of the warehouse on the Texas side of the Mexico border where she had been waiting and climbed into the back of the trailer.</p><p>She said the smugglers confiscated their cellphones and covered the trailer\u2019s floor with what she believes was powdered chicken bouillon, apparently to throw off any dogs at checkpoints. As she sat stuffed inside the stifling trailer with dozens of others, the powder stung her skin.</p><p>Remembering her friend's caution to stay near the door where it would be cooler, Cardona Tom\u00e1s shared the advice with another friend she had made during the journey.</p><p>\u201cI told a friend that we shouldn\u2019t go to the back and should stay near (the entrance), in the same place without moving,\u201d said Cardona Tom\u00e1s, who is being treated at Methodist Hospital Metropolitan in San Antonio. That friend survived, too.</p><p>___</p><p>Georgia subpoenaing Giuliani, Graham in Trump election probe</p><p>ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Georgia prosecutor investigating the conduct of former President Donald Trump and his allies after the 2020 election is subpoenaing U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and other members of Trump's campaign legal team to testify before a special grand jury.</p><p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on Tuesday filed petitions with the judge overseeing the special grand jury as part of her investigation into what she alleges was \"a multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>The move marks a major escalation in a case that could pose a serious legal challenge to the former president as he weighs another White House run. While the special grand jury has already heard from top state officials, Tuesday's filings directly target several of Trump's closest allies and advisers, including Giuliani, who led his campaign's legal efforts to overturn the election results.</p><p>\u201cIt means the investigation is obviously becoming more intense because those are trusted advisers, those are inner circle people,\u201d said Robert James, former district attorney in DeKalb County, which neighbors Fulton.</p><p>The special grand jury has been investigating whether Trump and others illegally tried to meddle in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia as he desperately tried to cling to power after Democrat Joe Biden's victory. Trump continues to insist that the election was stolen, despite the fact that numerous federal and local officials, a long list of courts, top former campaign staff and even Trump's own attorney general have all said there is no evidence of the fraud he alleges.</p><p>___</p><p>Parents of boy, 2, found alone at parade shooting among dead</p><p>Aiden McCarthy's photo was shared across Chicago-area social media groups in the hours after the July 4 parade shooting in Highland Park, accompanied by pleas to help identify the 2-year-old who had been found at the scene bloodied and alone and to reunite him with his family.</p><p>On Tuesday, friends and authorities confirmed that the boy's parents, Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35, were among seven people killed in the tragedy.</p><p>\u201cAt two years old, Aiden is left in the unthinkable position; to grow up without his parents,\u201d wrote Irina Colon on a GoFundMe account she created for the family and Aiden, who was reunited with his grandparents Monday evening.</p><p>Friends of the McCarthys said Irina\u2019s parents would care for the boy going forward.</p><p>Four of other others who were killed were identified Tuesday as Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; and Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78. Every victim was from Highland Park except for Toledo-Zaragoza, who was visiting family in the city from Morelos, Mexico.</p><p>___</p><p>New evacuations for communities near California forest fire</p><p>JACKSON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday for remote California communities near a wildfire that may have been sparked by fireworks or a barbecue on the Fourth of July in a mountainous region that's a top tourism destination.</p><p>The Electra Fire in Sierra Nevada Gold Country broke out Monday afternoon and tripled in size to more than 4.7 square miles (12.2 square kilometers) by Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cThe rate of spread isn\u2019t what it was like yesterday, but it is still spreading,\u201d said Amador County Sheriff Gary Redman. He said firefighters were working to keep flames confined to unpopulated canyon areas.</p><p>Mandatory evacuation orders and warnings combined affected up to 700 residents in Amador County and 300 to 400 people in Calaveras County, Redman said. Evacuation centers were set up for people and animals.</p><p>The fire started at a recreation area that was packed with people, forcing 85 to 100 celebrating the holiday at a river to take shelter at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. facility, Redman said. All were later safely evacuated.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge throws out Trump-era rollbacks on endangered species</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday threw out a host of actions by the Trump administration to roll back protections for endangered or threatened species, a year after the Biden administration said it was moving to strengthen such species protections.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in Northern California eliminated the Trump-era rules even as two wildlife agencies under President Joe Biden are reviewing or rescinding the regulations. The decision restores a range of protections under the Endangered Species Act \u2014 including some that date to the 1970s \u2014 while the reviews are completed. Environmental groups hailed the decision, which they said sped up needed protections and critical habitat designations for threatened species, including salmon in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Tigar's ruling \u201cspoke for species desperately in need of comprehensive federal protections without compromise,\u201d said Kristen Boyles, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice. \u201cThreatened and endangered species do not have the luxury of waiting under rules that do not protect them.\u201d</p><p>The court ruling comes as two federal agencies \u2014 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service \u2014 review five Endangered Species Act regulations finalized by President Donald Trump's administration, including critical habitat designations and rules requiring federal agencies to consult with the wildlife or fisheries services before taking actions that could affect threatened or endangered species.</p><p>Fish and Wildlife also said it will reinstate the decades-old \u201cblanket rule,\u201d which mandates additional protections for species that are newly classified as threatened. Those protections were removed under Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-07c55b81b295cba1ef2f52779afd9bb020220706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65VS-J6V1-JC5B-G453-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2151\"/><timeReceived>3:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 6, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

For any of the relatives of the 655,388 people who died from COVID, that legacy is already set in stone. His grotesquely self-centered mishandling of the pandemic is what lost him the election. He deserves worse than that. And the Trump wannabes like Ron DeSantis (R-FL), Greg Abbott[1] (R-TX) and Kristi Noem (R-SD) are in some ways as culpable as he is, especially now, when their policies are needlessly infecting and killing large numbers of people. </p><p><br/>As widely predicted-- and ignored by Noem-- the motorcycle rally in Sturgis is once again causing serious surges[2], and, unfortunately, not just in South Dakota. L.A. Times writer Stephen Groves reported this morning that at least 178 rallygoers in 5 status are down for the count with COVID infections already. <br/>Groves wrote that \"In the three weeks since the annual rally kicked off[3], coronavirus cases in South Dakota have shot up at a startling pace-- six-fold from the early days of August. While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the coronavirus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event. The nucleus of the rally, Meade County, is brimming with new cases, reaching a per-capita rate similar to that of the hardest-hit Southern states now dealing with a COVID-19 surge[4]. The county reported the highest rate of cases in South Dakota over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.\" The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the coronavirus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed.However, Meade County could be a harbinger for the upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.'This coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,' he said. 'It will find you, and it's so infectious.'Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations. Some health officials noted that people could have caught the virus elsewhere.A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that last year's rally looked like a superspreader event[5]. The team said the event offered a lesson: Such large gatherings can result in 'widespread transmission' of infections, and attendees should follow precautions such as getting vaccinated, wearing masks and social distancing.The aftermath of this year's rally looks eerily similar to last year-- when the event heralded a wave that did not subside until the winter. But the full fallout from the rally won't be seen for weeks, and an exact case count will likely remain unknown, Osterholm said.Daniel Bucheli, a spokesman for the South Dakota Department of Health, said the coronavirus spike was following 'a national trend being experienced in every state, not just South Dakota.'...Despite the more contagious Delta variant, this year's motorcycle rally was even bigger than last year[6]. More than 500,000 people showed up during the 10-day rally.The streets of Sturgis filled with rallygoers drawn to South Dakota's more libertarian attitude-- motorcycle helmets weren't required, minimal attire and bodypainting were welcome, and masks were often nowhere in sight. Bikers bellied up to bars and packed into rock shows.Two bands that performed at the rally have canceled shows after musicians came down with the coronavirus. Corey Taylor, the lead singer of Slipknot, who had embarked on a solo tour, told fans he was 'very, very sick' from COVID-19, though he did not say where he contracted it.'This is the worst I've ever been sick in my life,' Taylor said in a Facebook video this week. 'Had I not been vaccinated, I shudder to think how bad it would have been.' 49% of South Dakotans are fully vaccinated. But not all counties are equally. In Meade County (Sturgis), only 39% have been vaccinated. These are the 10 counties that voted most heavily for Trump-- along with their vaccination rates: <br/>Harding Co.- 92.0% Trump (14% fully vaccinated) <br/>Haakon Co.- 90.2% Trump (26% fully vaccinated) <br/>Douglas Co.- 86.0% Trump (32% fully vaccinated) <br/>Campbell Co.- 85.6% Trump (26% fully vaccinated) <br/>Perkins Co.- 83.9% Trump (22% fully vaccinated) <br/>Jones Co.- 83.1% Trump (48% fully vaccinated) <br/>Potter Co.- 82.5% Trump (42% fully vaccinated) <br/>Faulk Co.- 81.6% Trump (42% fully vaccinated) <br/>McPherson Co.- 81.2% Trump (10% fully vaccinated) <br/>Tripp Co.- 80.2% Trump (28% fully vaccinated) <br/>Still... as Chip Proser reminded me today, there is always this: <br/>\ufeff <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/abbott-s-texas-covid-strategy-isn-t-just-post-conservative-n1277825\">https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/abbott-s-texas-covid-strategy-isn-t-just-post-conservative-n1277825</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-30/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-coronavirus-infections-rising\">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-30/sturgis-motorcycle-rally-coronavirus-infections-rising</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-05/superspreader-sturgis-bike-rally-back-coronavirus-delta-variant\">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-05/superspreader-sturgis-bike-rally-back-coronavirus-delta-variant</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-20/bracing-for-worst-florida-covid-red-zone\">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-20/bracing-for-worst-florida-covid-red-zone</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-08-25/sturgis-rally-coronavirus-dozens-infections\">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-08-25/sturgis-rally-coronavirus-dozens-infections</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-06/sturgis-rally-roars-back-delta-cases-south-dakota\">https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-08-06/sturgis-rally-roars-back-delta-cases-south-dakota</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DOWT109308163038637440725979100046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOWT-7597</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63GY-89Y1-JCMN-Y2JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484238</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><timeReceived>5:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>DownWithTyranny</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 31, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Public Health &amp;

It is the world's first portfolio-scale TCFD reporting tool covering counterparty company assets.</p><p>XDI analyzed 1.8 millions assets associated with 1,800 listed companies in the US, Canada, Europe, Africa, the UK and Australia against climate risk hazards including flooding, coastal inundation, heat, drought and forest fire. XDI's data and analysis are the basis for the physical risk quantification in the new framework launched in London today.</p><p>\"XDI now offers the finance sector the most comprehensive climate risk assessment available in line with TCFD physical risk reporting,\" said XDI CEO Rohan Hamden. \"The new tool allows investors and potential buyers to carry out detailed analysis on companies and their assets independently.\"</p><p>\"The ability to assess a company's climate risk independently is a game-changer. A company can no longer hide risk and potential costs of impacts from extreme weather,\" Hamden said. \"Our new framework means that those who haven't assessed and reported climate risk are vulnerable in a market where detailed, counterparty assessment is now being carried out.\"</p><p>\"We at XDI hope the new framework will provide a more objective understanding of business climate risk and show that independent climate analysis -- not just self disclosure -- is now possible,\" Hamden said. \"Investors like L&amp;G can now undertake climate change risk analysis across a target company's assets anywhere globally.\"</p><p>Background:<br/>XDI:<url normalizedValue=\"http://xdi.systems\">http://xdi.systems</url>/\u00a0<br/>Legal &amp;

As Lytton, BC, broke Canada's all-time temperature record three days in a row and was then wiped off the map by a forest fire, Canada's public broadcaster promoted resource intensive, space consuming and carbon spewing trucks. </p><p><br/> Decades ago when it became clear humanity was hurtling towards a climate crisis, car ads should have been banned. Stopping auto companies' unrelenting ideological assault on the population is an important, probably necessary, step in moving away from a transport/living system structured around the environmentally destructive private automobile. <br/> CBC's promotion of gas guzzlers during its most widely viewed programing is a reminder that we aren't serious about mitigating the climate crisis. That no major group is challenging Canada's public broadcaster on the issue reflects the ecocidal nature of our political culture. <br/> It's not just the CBC. Public transit agencies[1] and environmental magazines[2] run car ads[3]. Even lefty university student papers[4] with well-defined ethical advertising guidelines put themselves at the service of the auto industry, which is the largest advertiser. <br/> Few within green groups challenge auto companies' ideological assault on the population. Even fewer discuss eliminating the private automobile, which devastates health and livability while greatly exacerbating climate and other ecological crises. Civilization could well collapse if we don't reshape our transport/living system away from the private automobile. <br/> Even if leftists agreed on the need to move beyond the private automobile, accomplishing the task would be a monumental achievement. But, the left is far from clear eyed on the matter, as highlighted indirectly in a recent Z Comm article titled 'Degrowth Policies[5] Cannot Avert Climate Crisis. We Need a Green New Deal'. In it Robert Pollin argues that degrowth theoreticians haven't properly fleshed out their ideas, are not offering a program that would decarbonize quickly enough and that it's possible to decouple economic growth from GHG emissions. <br/> This may all be true. But the idea of degrowth doesn't deter other decarbonization efforts and radicals shouldn't fear the label amidst the ecological calamity. In fact, we'd be better placed today if progressives had begun promoting degrowth a half century ago when it became clear humanity was surpassing earth's carrying capacity and that civilization was likely[6] to collapse this century. While Pollin hints at it, the most significant issue is decoupling our understanding of growth/GDP from wellness/social utility. <br/> In transport/living systems, degrowth usually makes cities more sustainable, healthy and pleasant. The more transport is structured to utilize shoes, bikes and rail, the fewer the resources expended getting around. At a national level the hyper auto centric US spends about twice[7] the share of its GDP on transport as Japan. Inter-city comparisons are also helpful. People in car-oriented Houston, Dallas and Tampa spend far more[8] than those in New York, Boston or Portland on transport. In more walking and bike-oriented cities such as Copenhagen, Fez or Amsterdam transport expenditures are a fraction of even the least car dependent North American cities. <br/> Looking at the issue on an individual level is also illuminating. I spend a few hundred dollars a year on transport and have easy access to shops, schools, day care, parks, community centres, libraries, etc. while many suburban Montralers expend 100 times more getting around. They generally spend far more time commuting as well. <br/> Auto centric transport/living systems can be massively degrowthed and decarbonized while improving livability and public health. <br/> (Degrowing the US health system would generate massive social gains as well. Just by adopting Canada's publicly funded, universal healthcare model the US could shave five points from its GDP and increase life expectancy. Similarly, cutting the US military down to Canada's per capita size could cut a couple more points off GDP with major social and ecological benefits.) <br/> Progressives need to state clearly that we seek to slash the resources devoted to transport. The private automobile is a mode of transport/living that must be overcome if we are concerned about species survival. Ending our addiction to the private automobile requires radical changes to urban planning, the entire built landscape, laws, transport options, etc. But another obstacle is ideological, the incessant promotion of the idea that a truck or car will make someone 'manly', 'high status', 'hip', etc. A good place to begin resistance to the planet destroying auto companies' insidious assault on our psyches is by pressuring Canada's public broadcaster to stop promoting fuel, resource and space intensive trucks. <br/> At least while the Montral Canadiens are playing.

General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies. \"Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn't quite make it before it's time for the event to start,\" Thunberg recalls. Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that's at the heart of Thunberg's work. </p><p>The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. Thunberg's blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasional pushback and even death threats. To Thunberg's disappointment, her message doesn't seem to be getting through. The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next seven-and-a-half years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord's ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 2.7 Fahrenheit this century. Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed \"carbon budget\" left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years. \"Do you remember the London Olympics? \u2018Gangnam Style' or the first \u2018Hunger Games' movie?\" Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. \"Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That's the amount of time we're talking about.\" Her monthslong journey from Sweden to America's West Coast and back \u2014 by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said. It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate. \"The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,\" Thunberg says. \"The ones who'll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. \" Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls \"creative accounting\" to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word \"green\" to industries that are not. \"The emperors are naked. Every single one,\" she says. \"It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Greta Thunberg</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001185949</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6066-MSP1-JBRC-V04S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 21, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DHPL</classCode><className>GERMAN CHANCELLORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp;

It burned for 79 days, destroyed more than 512,000 hectares, damaged vast biodiverse ecosystems, and threatened the health of millions of Australians.</p><p>It is recognised that the ongoing failure to address climate change helped to fuel this bushfire.</p><p>The AMA and DEA are calling on the Australian Government to:</p><p>Develop a national climate change and health strategy to facilitate planning for future climate health impacts;</p><p>Undertake an ambitious reduction in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions aligned to science-based targets;</p><p>Establish an Australian Sustainable Development Unit to support environmentally sustainable practice in healthcare and reduce the sector's own significant emissions; and</p><p>Support policies that acknowledge the health benefits of a transition to renewable energy.</p><p>\"As Australia recovers from the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjusts to ongoing restrictions and economic changes, it's important that we also prioritise the health impacts of climate change,\" AMA President, Dr Omar Khorshid, said.</p><p>\"The 2019-20 bushfire season in Australia was catastrophic, and had severe health consequences.</p><p>\"Along with more than 30 tragic deaths directly attributable to the fires, exposure to bushfire smoke caused an estimated 417 excess deaths, 1124 hospitalisations for cardiovascular problems, and 2027 hospitalisations for respiratory problems.</p><p>\"The mental health impacts of the fires and months of smoke haze are still being felt around the country and are likely to be significant and protracted.</p><p>\"The AMA Federal Council's declaration last year that Climate Change is a Health Emergency was an ominous prediction of the terrible effects of the bushfires just weeks afterwards.</p><p>\"Just as the Australian Government has been at its best in responding to COVD-19 when basing its strategy on science and evidence, we ask for a similar response to the real threats to the health of Australians due to climate change. The AMA and DEA are making a clear commitment to work together to address the health impacts of climate change.\"</p><p>\"The recovery from one health emergency, COVID-19, cannot be allowed to further contribute to climate change, which is the other very real and significant health emergency,\" DEA Co-Chair, Dr Eugenie Kayak, said.</p><p>\"In committing to work together, our two associations are recognising that the health impacts of climate change have fallen off the political and social agenda in Australia, and it is time for a renewed focus to protect the health of present and future generations.</p><p>\"Climate change is a devastating health emergency that needs to be urgently addressed.</p><p>\"It is beholden on doctors and the health sector more broadly to work towards deep cuts to carbon emissions and limit global warming to manageable temperatures. We have an obligation to 'First, do no harm' - public health and wellbeing depend on it.\"</p><p>In order to achieve progress on climate change and health, we need our Federal parliamentarians to show leadership.</p><p>The AMA and DEA are pleased to see current efforts by independent parliamentarians, including an upcoming Climate Bill being introduced by Zali Steggall in November, to advance legislation on climate change which is above politics and based on science, and which includes acknowledgement of its health effects.</p><p>We encourage all parliamentarians to advocate for practical, meaningful policies to mitigate the health impacts of climate change.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7277607 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7277607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6152-GG71-JC11-1552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 26, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The agency said Brazil led the way with 54,771 cases tallied and the U.S. second at 36,617.</p><p>With the United States now reporting a quarter of the world's total coronavirus cases, eight states - California among them - last week hit single-day new-case highs, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>In California, much of the increase in the total number of cases does appear to be a result of more testing, health officials say.</p><p>Places such as San Diego County have seen a steady uptick in testing, but officials Sunday reported 310 new cases for a positive test rate of 7.2 percent - much higher than the 14-day moving average positive rate of 2.8 percent. No additional deaths were reported.</p><p>In some of the most affected states, such as Florida and Arizona, not only are larger proportions of tests coming back positive, but more of the afflicted are becoming sicker, Thomas Inglesby of Johns Hopkins' School of Public Health said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"</p><p>\"What we are seeing is increased positivity in testing, and in many cases increased hospitalization,\" Inglesby said. \"That's not just because we're doing more testing in a state; that's because there is more serious disease in a state.\"</p><p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, conceded that point at a news conference on Saturday, saying that even with test rates flat or increasing, \"the number of people testing positive is accelerating faster than that.\"</p><p>Although death rates in the U.S. from COVID-19 have continued to decline after the peak hit in New York in April, the number of people hospitalized has climbed sharply in several states, and health officials fear that deaths could start rising again soon.</p><p>\"This is going to be hard to get under control,\" said Scott Gottlieb, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration earlier in Trump's tenure. \"These are big states that have a lot of cases; they've been building.\"</p><p>In addition to California, other states that recently have reported highs in single-day new infections include Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah, according to Johns Hopkins' coronavirus tracker. Several of those states were among the earliest to allow businesses to fully reopen.</p><p>Interviewed on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Gottlieb said that while \"we're not going to want to shut down business again,\" there were \"not a lot of tools we can reach for\" as the spread of the virus continues.</p><p>Trump has focused on pushing states to reopen. At his rally Saturday in Tulsa, held amid a spike of coronavirus cases in Oklahoma, he called testing for the virus \"a double-edged sword,\" adding: \"When you do testing to that extent, you're gonna find more people; you're gonna find more cases.\"</p><p>Trump has often suggested that more testing fuels an inflated sense of the seriousness of the crisis.</p><p>But addressing the relatively thin rally crowd - the Tulsa Fire Department on Sunday put attendance at 6,200 in a 19,200-capacity arena - he went further, saying: \"So I said to my people, 'Slow down the testing, please.'\"</p><p>The president's aides quickly declared he was making a humorous aside, a line they stuck with in television interviews Sunday.</p><p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, appearing on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" called Trump's testing remark \"tongue-in-cheek\" and \"a light moment.\"</p><p>Pressed as to why Trump would make a jocular reference to a pandemic that has cost at least 120,000 American lives, he responded testily: \"Asked and answered.\"</p><p>Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said on ABC's \"This Week\" that while many of Trump's remarks on a variety of subjects stem from \"a humor standpoint,\" the rally comment also reflected \"frustration\" over media coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>\"All they want to focus on is an increasing test count - we know that's going to occur when you're testing more,\" he said.</p><p>Critics of the president, who in recent weeks have primarily focused on his seeming indifference to the nationwide upheaval over racial injustice, found the remark unfunny. Black people and Latinos are disproportionately sickened and killed by the virus, and in his rally speech, Trump referred to COVID-19 using an anti-Asian slur.</p><p>\"This is no time to joke,\" said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, asked on CNN about the president's slow-the-testing comment. \"Even if it were a joke, which it was not, it was an inappropriate joke. Do you think the people, the 120,000 families out there who are missing their loved ones, thought it was funny?\"</p><p>Public health experts stressed they were not urging a return to the lockdowns that began in mid-March and continued for weeks, sending unemployment soaring.</p><p>But too many parts of the United States are acting as if the pandemic is over, said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>Speaking on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Osterholm said he saw less likelihood now of a lull between the initial outbreak and a possible second wave later this year.</p><p>\"I'm actually of the mind right now - I think this is more like a forest fire,\" he said. \"I don't think that this is going to slow down.\"</p><p>Without referring specifically to the Trump administration, he said the lack of a coordinated overall policy was worsening the crisis.</p><p>\"We're at 70 percent of the number of cases today that we were at the very height of the pandemic cases in early April, and yet I don't see any kind of a 'This is where we need to go, this is what we need to do to get there' kind of effort,\" Osterholm said. \"And that's one of our challenges.\"</p><p>Most experts are counseling greater adherence to health guidelines including use of face coverings, physical distancing and caution when in indoor spaces.</p><p>At Trump's rally, most participants were without masks, and many clustered close together. Participants had to sign a waiver saying they would not seek legal redress if they contracted the virus.</p><p>Wolf, asked on NBC whether the rally set a bad example and endangered attendees, said \"activities like this are allowed\" and pointed out that masks and hand sanitizer were available and temperature checks conducted.</p><p>\"I think it's important. It's also a personal choice that people are making,\" he said.</p><p>King writes for the Los Angeles Times.

Timothy Strong, a UAS maintenance team leader in the company. \"We have simulators, but nothing beats doing the real thing.\"</p><p>Once airborne, the Shadow is capable of up to six hours of flight time providing live imagery directly to the 27th brigade Tactical Operations Center.</p><p>The arrival of COVID-19 earlier this year threw a wrench in the unit's training plans, Strong said.</p><p>Normally, the Soldiers are able to fly multiple times per year. But Delta Company's Shadows have been grounded for months as the unit conducted virtual drills in accordance with the pandemic's social distancing mandates.</p><p>\"It's been really difficult because people haven't been able to get hands-on much this year,\" said Strong. \"Normally, we'll come up to Fort Drum in April, May, June, July and August, for a week or two so people can stay current and maintain their flight proficiency.\"</p><p>In addition to the unforeseen challenges that COVID-19 presented to mission readiness, other variables have prevented the UAS operators from pursuing their required flight time.</p><p>The Shadow is launched from a vehicle-towed pneumatic catapult. As a fair-weather aircraft, it is only able to fly in specific conditions. For much of the unit's annual training, strong winds and rainstorms kept the Shadows grounded.</p><p>Maintaining operator proficiency is critical for the rapid deployment of the UAS platoon. Though the Shadow was designed with the battlefield as its main focus, there are many domestic situations that benefit from the intelligence and imagery provided by the Shadow, Strong said.</p><p>\"I participated in California where we assisted in forest fire reconnaissance,\" he said.</p><p>\"Hopefully, in the future we can help with flood damage assessments and stuff like that throughout New York State. So it's important for us to maintain our currency so we can actually do things like that,\" Strong said.</p><p>\"It takes a lot a lot of skill and determination to be able to do this job,\" said Pvt. Colin Pare, an unmanned aerial systems operator. \"You need to focus on a lot of small things. You need to just be meticulous and knowledgeable.\"</p><p>Pare, 18, and right out of training, is the unit's newest Soldier.</p><p>\"My training was about four months long, but I got the ropes fairly quickly and realized what I could do,\" Pare said.</p><p>New York National Guard</p><p>27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team</p><p>unmanned aerial system</p><p>eye in the sky</p><p>152nd Brigade Engineer

impromptu press conference or a pleasant daydream Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / MARK WILSON  <br/>The track stretches 3,100 feet -- a shade under a kilometer -- with the 90-second hop between stations just enough for serious political debate, idle gossip, an impromptu press conference or a moment of quiet reverie. <br/>\"Think about getting on the train to ride to work in other contexts, where you have that moment where you can just sit for a minute and think -- or sit and have casual conversation,\" Holt said. <br/>\"The train in the Capitol has served that purpose as well over time.\" <br/> The track stretches 3,100 feet -- a shade under a kilometer -- with a 90-second hop between stations Photo: AFP / Olivier DOULIERY  <br/>It has also provided useful photo opportunities for presidential hopefuls looking to show the common touch, such as Ronald Reagan, although a boyish JFK -- then just plain old Senator Jack Kennedy -- was once refused entry and scolded to \"stand aside for the senators, son.\" <br/> This 1934 image courtesy of the Library of Congress, shows people riding the US Capitol's subway system Photo: Library of Congress / Handout  <br/>Today, the bustling main station is abuzz whenever the Senate is in session, with journalists waiting patiently to swarm legislators as they disembark to vote in the upper chamber. <br/>But the cut-and-thrust of political discourse isn't always as convivial below ground as it is on the Senate floor. <br/> Barack Obama may be one of the world's most famous faces but to his fellow subway passengers in 2007, he was just another senator Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / MARK WILSON  <br/>In 1950, Maine senator Margaret Chase Smith was preparing to deliver a rebuke to fellow Republican Joe McCarthy when the intimidating anti-communist crusader and smear-artist saw her in a subway car. <br/>\"Margaret, you look very serious,\" Smith later recalled McCarthy saying, according to Holt. \"Are you going to make a speech?\" <br/>\"Yes,\" she responded, \"and you're not going to like it very much.\" <br/> Actor Denzel Washington, pictured in 2018 after riding the Capitol Subway, is a among a long list of celebrity patrons that also includes Richard Gere, Chuck Norris, Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / MARK WILSON  <br/>Three years earlier the subway had seen its only recorded assassination attempt, when disgruntled ex-Capitol Police officer William Kaiser opened fire from a .22-caliber pistol on presidential hopeful John Bricker. <br/>The Ohio senator dived for cover into the waiting subway car, yelling at the driver to whisk him away, as a second bullet whistled over his head. <br/>\"Only good fortune and the bad marksmanship of his assailant saved the senator,\" The New York Times reported after the gunman fled the scene, only to be arrested later. <br/>In less querulous times, political leaders have seen the subway as something of a refuge from the frenetic pace of Washington politics. <br/>William Howard Taft, the 27th president, alarmed aides one Saturday in January 1911 when he went missing for around an hour to go see the trains. <br/>\"A keen thrill of fear swept over the city when anxious inquiries at the White House brought forth the reply that the president could not be found. The alarm spread like a forest fire,\" the Washington Times reported at the time. <br/>The first subway was opened on March 7 1909 for senators hoping to avoid the punishing Washington heat as they went between their offices and the upper chamber. <br/>Electric Studebaker automobiles were replaced by a monorail with its own track three years later and, in 1960, officials added four $75,000 electric subway cars -- dubbed \"swift chariots of democracy\" by the Senate chaplain. <br/>A House line connected the Rayburn House Office Building to the Capitol five years after that and, in 1993, an $18 million Disneyland-style driverless train was introduced to great fanfare. <br/>Not everyone supported these improvements. Some senators grumbled about bumpy rides while others complained that their delicately coiffured hair was being ruined by gusts of wind. Ohio's Mike DeWine banned his staff from riding in protest against government waste. <br/>Future presidents aside, the system's famous patrons have included actors Richard Gere, Chuck Norris and Denzel Washington, satirist Jon Stewart and the rock star Bono. <br/>Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award-winning creator of hit musical \"Hamilton,\" decided to take a midnight ride and belt out show tunes for his Twitter following when he was in the building to receive an award in 2017. <br/>Some Capitol Hill staff see the gentility of subway interactions becoming rarer as health-conscious politicians with step-counting devices increasingly take to walking between buildings. <br/>But the clientele will never truly disappear as long as the urgent task of running the country requires busy people to be in 10 places at once. <br/>\"If you're in a rush, it's great,\" Holt told AFP. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671632711022437259793000204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PN-3GB1-JCMN-Y1WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><timeReceived>2:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 27, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>LIBRARY OF CONGRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

When they hear its jihad, I'm sure they'll apologize - to Muslims. Jan 7, 20204:00 pm By Robert Spencer[1]Australia has just arrested a number of arsonists who are accused of setting the wildfires that are ravaging the country. Could they have anything to do with the fact that jihadis have identified setting fires as a tool of jihad? This has been a threat for years.

Police allege Fadi and Abraham Zreika, both 18, set off fireworks that sparked a grass fire at Bright Park, Guildford, on December 22. Police were called to the park about 2.40pm after reports of several loud explosions and saw fireworks exploding and several small grassfires that spread rapidly in sudden winds. Zraika, of Villawood, and Zreika, of Merrylands, were arrested at a fast food restaurant in Merrylands.Jim Hoft points out: For many years, both al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) have offered instructions to its operatives and followers in the West about how to start large wildfires.Because of the great difficulty in identifying the perpetrators of the kinds of wildfires, only a few Muslims have been caught and arrested. But considering how many wildfires take place every year, it is not out of line to presume that some of the fires have been Al-Qaeda-inspired.

Crews had only managed to contain around 5% of the fire as it continued pushing into residential areas and began threatening the San Bernardino National Forest.The fire started Friday in Cherry Valley around 5 p.m.[2], reportedly as three different brush fires. The blaze rapidly grew and engulfed nearly 2,000 acres and forced authorities to issue evacuation orders around 10 p.m. Friday to Cherry Valley residents. </p><p>It grew over the weekend, aided by terrain state officials said made it more difficult to contain the fire.'We've got extremely steep, rugged terrain. We have many different drainages that are all kind of intersecting together and that creates these funneling effects of different wind patterns and creates more erratic fire behavior,' San Bernardino National Forest fire information officer Lisa Cox[3] told reporters.'And with that, we have very thick brush including this really flammable ecosystem called chaparral that likes to burn and it hasn't burned here in a long time.'The fire grew to such a degree the National Weather Service said smoke from the fire was visible over parts of western Arizona. Fire crews not directly combating the fire have been stationed in various neighborhoods in the fire's projected path should they need to be evacuated, which some residents said has loomed over their area for the whole weekend.'The fire burned north of us for quite some time and eventually it worked its way over here,' Riverside County resident Doug Hammer told Los Angeles CBS-affiliate KCBS[4]. He said there is growing fear in his neighborhood as the fire continued to spread, pointing to fire trucks stationed by a local ranch.'There's a fire truck sitting among the trees over there next to the home,' Hammer said. The California wildfires were the costliest tragedy in 2019 at $25 billion in damages, according to the British charity Christian Aid Photo: AFP / Josh Edelson [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-fire-california-spread-20000-acres-evactuations/\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-fire-california-spread-20000-acres-evactuations/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/31/evacuations-ordered-as-apple-fire-burns-60-acres-in-cherry-valley-threatens-homes/\">https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/07/31/evacuations-ordered-as-apple-fire-burns-60-acres-in-cherry-valley-threatens-homes/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/03/us/california-apple-fire-monday/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/03/us/california-apple-fire-monday/index.html</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/08/02/apple-fire-in-riverside-county-intensifies-to-20000-acres-5-percent-containment/\">https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/08/02/apple-fire-in-riverside-county-intensifies-to-20000-acres-5-percent-containment/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159646954968175776100089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H6-4D91-JCMN-Y105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

So, at a moment when the dollar doesn't go as far as it once did, should Americans worry that injecting another $1.85 trillion into the economy might increase inflation?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No, Jen Psaki told Peter Alexander this week. And why not? Well, the White House press secretary <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/11/15/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-november-15-2021/\">explained</url> to the NBC News correspondent, \"because no economist out there is projecting that this will have a negative impact on inflation.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, that isn't true. There are many economists out there and some of them <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do </emphasis>warn that the Build Back Better plan will further increase the prices that dog consumers and can doom the careers of politicians. But the existence of economists with views contrary to those held by the president's National Economic Council isn't entirely the point. At issue more broadly is the fulfillment of something Joe Biden said back in April 2020. </p><p>\"Milton Friedman,\" he said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/25/joe-biden-green-stimulus-207848\">as a candidate,</url> \"isn't running the show anymore.\" And nothing could be truer now that Biden is the president.</p><p>As the first year of his administration nears completion, inflation has emerged as an unwelcome accompaniment. It has not hit the double-digit levels that propelled Friedman, the late Nobel Prize laureate who warned about the dangers of an unchecked money supply, to prominence in the late 1970s. But consumer prices jumped 6.2%, years over year, in October, the biggest such increase in three decades.</p><p>\"There's no doubt inflation is high right now. It's affecting Americans' pocketbooks. It's affecting their outlook,\" Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, told Chuck Todd on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday. \"But it's important that we put this in context. When the president took office, we were facing an all-out economic crisis.\"</p><p>The White House argues that those inflation numbers are transitory and will eventually come down. The temporary pain that consumers feel, they contend, is the result of pent-up demand and kinks in the supply chain, not because of excesses in government spending. Two of the president's other economic advisers, Jared Bernstein and Ernie Tedeschi, dismissed early inflation warnings and predicted that price increases \"should fade over time as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/blog/2021/04/12/pandemic-prices-assessing-inflation-in-the-months-and-years-ahead/\">That was in April.</url></p><p>But lingering inflation hasn't lessened the administration's appetite for spending\u2014 witness the $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan signed into law this week or the $1.85 Build Back Better plan that's still pending in Congress. The White House has shooed away concerns in recent weeks by pointing to a letter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/\">from 17 Nobel laureates</url> who predict that the spending \"will ease longer-term inflationary pressures\" and to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-rating-agencies-say-bidens-spending-plans-will-not-add-inflationary-2021-11-17/\">analysis by Moody's Investor Services</url> that reached the same conclusion.</p><p>\"They're all wrong,\" said Steven Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. He doesn't deny that supply chains are backed up or that there may be pent-up demand. But Hanke told RealClearPolitics that those are \"ad hoc excuses.\" Inflation is being driven by \"the money supply which has increased by over 35% since COVID, an unprecedented explosion since World War II.\"</p><p>Along with John Greenwood, chief economist at the investment management company Invesco in London, Hanke likens the situation to a bathtub with three drains. The first two drains are economic growth and savings. In the absence of inflation, money that flows into the tub easily flows out of the tub through those two drains. \"But if more money is flowing in than out,\" the two reasoned in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/monetary-bathtub-overflowing-inflation-drain-transitory-11634847429\">a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed</url>, \"the level of money rises. It will eventually reach the overflow, which is the inflation drain.\"</p><p>An alumnus of the Reagan administration and a fervent supply-sider, Hanke notes that between December 2019 and August 2021, the supply of dollars in circulation grew by $5.5 trillion, \"a stunning 35.7% increase in only a year-and-a-half, driven primarily by the Federal Reserve's purchase of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\"</p><p>Enter Biden and his human-infrastructure package. In Detroit on Wednesday, the president argued that his plan \"is fully paid for\" and does not increase the deficit \"one single cent.\" The spending plan would be paid for by new taxes on top earners who make more than $400,000, the administration insists. That might be true, if the bill that reaches Biden's desk includes those tax increases, an unpopular possibility currently being debated in Congress. But that's a big if: Sen. Joe Manchin, a linchpin for passage in the upper chamber, has repeatedly expressed his concerns.</p><p>There are other snags. As the New York Times reports, the head of the Congressional Budget Office<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/politics/biden-social-policy-bill-irs.html\">warned Monday</url> that cracking down on tax evaders would produce about $120 billion, not the $400 billion Biden is relying on to cover some of the spending. While a full formal analysis is still expected, Hanke and others argue that deficit spending \"makes the Fed's job a lot more difficult\" because when the Treasury Department issues new bonds to cover that debt, \"what are they going to do? Say, \u2018Oh, no \u2014 we're not going to buy anymore.' They are buying those bonds. That's why the balance sheet of the Fed gets bigger and bigger. And that's why the money supply gets bigger and bigger.\"</p><p>The notion that increased government spending doesn't carry the risk of inflation, said Michael Jay Boskin, an economics professor at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, \"is economically illiterate.\" Increased government spending adds to the total demand for goods and services, he added, \"such that we are risking inflation, and the Biden administration seems to be trying divert attention. There is a risk that inflation may become entrenched. It's hard to imagine a worse outcome than an inflation spiral.\"</p><p>Chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 1993, Boskin notes that \"a very large fraction\" of the relief payments the federal government sent out in 2020 and 2021 was either saved or has yet to be spent. \"That is a lot of government spending floating around the system now in the pockets of consumers and the budgets of state and local governments,\" waiting to further flood the economy.</p><p>On the question of inflation, illustrations of the concept abound. A flood of dollars chasing too few goods. The monetary supply as an overflowing bathtub. But anti-tax conservative Stephen Moore prefers a more colorful one: \"dumping gasoline on a forest fire.\" A member of former President Trump's economic task force, Moore questions the Biden administration's explanation for inflation, specifically the idea that the problem is pent up demand post-pandemic. \"Because if that's the case, why did we spend $2 trillion earlier this year,\" he said of the American Rescue Plan. \"It doesn't make any sense.\"</p><p>The White House likely won't heed his warnings or those of any naysayers. Analysis from Reagan and Bush alumni \u2014 let alone Trump advisers \u2014 certainly isn't in fashion in this administration, especially since, as Biden noted more than a year ago, Milton Friedman \"isn't running the show anymore.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REALCP-httpswwwrealclearpoliticscomarticles20211119psakisnoeconomistassertiondrawssomeinflationdissenters146760html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REALCP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64C8-9RB1-F03F-K54B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">478254</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><timeReceived>11:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Real Clear Holdings, LLC  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RealClearPolitics</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13216\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 19, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom &amp;

While not quite as strong as the event in late June and early July, it has still led to record-shattering temperatures. 107.7F: Warmest daily low temperature[2] on record for the U.S., set Sunday at Stovepipe Wells, California.117F: All-time high temperature record at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, which was tied on Saturday, per a National Weather Service[3] statement.107F: All-time high temperature record set July 9 at Grand Junction, Colorado, where records date back to 1893[4]. 143,607 acres: Size of the Bootleg Fire in Oregon as of Sunday, after the fire doubled in size on three consecutive days. The fire was forecast to see \"extreme\" rates of growth as temperatures climbed on Sunday afternoon.4,000 acres: Size of the fast-growing River Fire in Mariposa and Madera Counties in California, forcing evacuations late Sunday. Threat level: On Sunday, Canada's Interagency Forest Fire Center elevated its readiness level[5] to 5 \u2014 the top of the scale, noting \"active agencies may take emergency measures to sustain incident operations.\" Dozens of wildfires are burning in diverse ecosystems[6] ranging from temperate rainforests to the boreal region that rings the Arctic.The fires in Canada erupted when a massive, slow-moving heat dome stalled over southwestern British Columbia in late June into early July, shattering all-time heat records[7] and killing hundreds[8]. Firefighting agencies in the U.S. are at a high state of readiness due to large wildfires burning in multiple states. On Saturday, two firefighters working with the Bureau of Land Management to conduct aerial reconnaissance of the Cedar Basin Fire in northwest Arizona died when their plane crashed[9]. The Bootleg Fire continues to threaten a key conduit of power between the Pacific Northwest and California. Known as Path 66, the high voltage power lines supply a total of 4,800 megawatts of electricity to the heat-stressed California grid.The fire reduced that flow[10] of electricity on Friday and Saturday and could do so again. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order[11] to relieve some of the grid stress, and a \"Flex Alert[12]\" to conserve power is in effect for Monday. Context: Drought conditions have created tinderbox dry conditions throughout the West, including high elevation forests, extending the length of the peak wildfire season. In California, twice as many acres have burned so far this year[13] than had burned by this point last year \u2014 and 2020 was California's worst wildfire year on record. Between the lines: Human-caused global warming is a major factor[14] behind the severity, longevity and frequency of the heat waves in the American West and other parts of the world. In addition, studies show that the West is seeing[15] more frequent and larger wildfires as climate change alters precipitation patterns and the timing of the wet and dry seasons. Climate change is also leading to more days with extreme fire weather conditions that feature unusually high temperatures, strong winds, and extremely low humidity values. What's next: Heat advisories and warnings in effect for the Central Valley of California, where farm workers have been laboring[16] in lethal temperatures, continue on Monday \u2014 but temperatures are forecast to be a few degrees lower than they were over the weekend. Other parts of the West are under heat warnings as well.Records that fall are likely to be daily records, rather than all-time milestones. No end to the hot and dry weather pattern across the West, however, is in sight. <br/> [ 1]: <url

The project is accessible year-round via a 15 minute drive on a paved highway which runs the length of the northern claim boundary and a network of well-maintained logging roads.</p><p>The Dixie Project hosts two principal styles of gold mineralization:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">High-grade gold in quartz veins and silica-sulphide replacement zones (Dixie Limb, Hinge and Arrow zones). Hosted by mafic volcanic rocks and localized near regional-scale D2 fold axes. These mineralization styles are also typical of the significant mined deposits of the Red Lake district. High-grade disseminated gold with broad moderate to lower grade envelopes (LP Fault). The LP Fault is a significant gold-hosting structure which has been seismically imaged to extend to 14 kilometres depth (Zeng and Calvert, 2006), and has been interpreted by Great Bear to have up to 18 kilometres of strike length on the Dixie property. High-grade gold mineralization is controlled by structural and geological contacts, and moderate to lower-grade disseminated gold surrounds and flanks the high-grade intervals. The dominant gold-hosting stratigraphy consists of felsic sediments and volcanic units.</emphasis></p><p>About Great Bear</p><p>Great Bear Resources Ltd.\u00a0is a well-financed gold exploration company managed by a team with a track record of success in mineral exploration.\u00a0 Great Bear is focused in the prolific Red Lake gold district in northwest Ontario, where the company controls over 200 km2 of highly prospective tenure across 4 projects, all 100% owned: The flagship Dixie Project, the Pakwash Property, the Sobel Property, and the Red Lake North Property, all of which are accessible year-round through existing roads.</p><p>Qualified Person and NI 43-101 Disclosure</p><p>Mr. R.

Body cameras became popular, if not necessary, to document the actions of both police officers and the public. Cameras have limitations as to how they record a scene regarding their clarity, angle of view and sound qualities. But to use them as a behavior therapy tool, as suggested by the League of Minnesota Cities, is faulty logic. First, who appointed the league to be some recognized authority for police policies? Departments must create their own policies based on many aspects of their unique size, demographics, resources and history. Departments being pigeonholed by some national guidelines is also erroneous thinking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turning on cameras only for emergency calls ignores those calls that started out as nonconfrontational but turned into something much more. This is the same faulty logic as the so-called \"routine traffic stop.\" Any contact with the public should be documented.</p><p>The notion that \"bad cops\" should wear cameras as a behavior modification tool becomes a quagmire for policy benchmarks. If you have cops with a history of lying both on and off the stand plus other violations, why are they working for your agency? Cameras shouldn't be used as a stigma to keep officers in line. Shall police departments become judged by how many officers are required to wear body cameras? No. It has to be a department-wide approach - all or nothing.</p><p>A responsible department must always be mindful as to how its policies are working. To \"reform\" doesn't mean something is wrong. It means you are constantly raising your standards to optimize your public safety mission. This includes body cameras.</p><p>Joe Polunc, Waconia</p><p>The writer is a retired deputy sheriff.</p><p>\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7</p><p>A couple of recent letter writers have argued that Daunte Wright brought trouble upon himself by neglecting to comply with police orders. This attitude fails to acknowledge the distinct dangers that Black citizens, especially young Black men, encounter when interacting with law enforcement.</p><p>\"This group is probably predominantly white because there's not looting and fires,\" a Minneapolis police officer said when confronting people protesting George Floyd's murder. Said another, \"You guys are out hunting people now. It's just a nice change of tempo.\"</p><p>When Caron Nazario, a Black Army lieutenant in uniform who was pulled over for not having a permanent rear license plate, refused police orders to exit his vehicle, he told them he was \"honestly afraid to get out.\" An officer replied, \"Yeah, you should be!\" He also said, \"You're fixing to ride the lightning, son.\"</p><p>After he did everything right at his traffic stop, Philando Castile was shot five times, twice in the heart.</p><p>It's not a simple choice to follow orders when \"I can't breathe\" is the common refrain of a long line of victims who look like you dying at the hands of those who are supposed to protect us. Law enforcement officers should understand that if they want compliance, they first have to earn the trust of all the citizens they serve.</p><p>Jeff Naylor, Minneapolis</p><p>INTERSTATE 94</p><p>Time to balance the burden</p><p>The defense of keeping Interstate 94 as a freeway is interesting as it's based on its regional value. This is illustrated in \"There won't soon be another chance to rethink I-94 corridor\" (Dec. 19) through an example of a hypothetical commuter traveling across the metro from their home in the city of Minnetonka to their job at the 3M campus in Maplewood 30 miles away.</p><p>This differs from the common defense of Twin Cities highways on the grounds of suburbanites commuting to their jobs in Minneapolis and St Paul. I find this argument effectively shuts down an examination of costs, as these cities are dependent on these commuters and therefore costs are irrelevant.</p><p>In fact, the example may be more the rule than the exception, as 70% of jobs reside in the suburbs outside of the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, according to a 2015 Metropolitan Council report. Simply put, many, many commuters are traveling through the cities while providing no direct benefit to the communities. Nevertheless, these highways do impose a cost on the cities through lost property taxes. The highways were not located along existing streets; rather, they were located on the taxable land between streets. Additionally, highways depress the value of nearby properties. An analysis published on streets.mn estimates Minneapolis loses $43 million in property taxes annually.</p><p>When reimagining I-94 and making decisions based on its regional value, I hope the Department of Transportation will also consider I-94's costs on communities. My ideal outcome would be an expansion of Hwy. 62 and I-694 to relieve congestion on I-94. If the value is regional, the costs should be regional as well.</p><p>Ronald Hobson, St. Louis Park</p><p>FOOD SYSTEM</p><p>Happy animals are the outliers</p><p>In today's industrial food system, there is a stark contrast between the story marketed to consumers about where their animal-based food comes from and the grim reality concealed from view. The picture accompanying the story in the Dec. 26 Star Tribune, \"Farm-animal law prompts lawsuit,\" reprinted from the Associated Press, only serves to perpetuate this confusion. In 2018, California voters, by a compelling 2-to-1 ratio, approved a law that requires the most basic compassion for animals: \"enough space to stand and turn around.\"</p><p>Three years later, most hog producers have not made changes to comply with this law and a coalition of restaurants and grocery stores have filed a lawsuit to try to delay implementation. If consumers were presented with the reality of the awful cruelty inflicted on animals to produce their meat, they might think twice about what they choose to eat. Instead, though, this article is accompanied by a half-page, full-color photo of an idyllic farm setting: a few happy, healthy pigs casually hanging around outside in a large open field on a clear sunny day. This image is what the pork industry wants to sell us and bears absolutely no resemblance to the grotesque reality of industrial pork production. The image is so detached from the reality that California voters are trying to address; we challenge the Star Tribune to explain why it chose this photo to accompany this story.</p><p>Ben Auckenthaler and Samantha Crosby, Minneapolis</p><p>WINTER</p><p>Better out than in</p><p>My recent 45-minute walk around Burnsville's Earley Lake was physically and spiritually uplifting. What a treat to see three dozen mallards relishing the open water created by melted snow flowing in from a residential storm sewer. How fortunate we are to witness nature's beauty and adaptability. Especially in the midst of omicron, I think trekking through a local park is preferable to stomping on a gym treadmill.</p><p>Camille Lenling, Burnsville</p><p>THE NEW YEAR</p><p>May we all be doing our duty</p><p>On May 19, 1780, a strange intense darkness descended over New England. Later it was understood to be caused by forest fire smoke from Canada coinciding with massive fog and cloud cover. But at the time, it provoked foreboding and terror!</p><p>As this darkness draped the chamber of the Connecticut Legislature, a movement to adjourn the meeting was put forward in case it was the end of the world.</p><p>Abraham Davenport, a member of the legislature, responded to the call for adjournment with these words: \"I am against adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment; if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles may be brought.\"</p><p>What helpful words as we move into a new year!</p><p>The crises and problems in the world right now can make one want to turn inside, throw up walls and await the end as comfortably as possible.</p><p>But like our friend Mr. Davenport, in the year ahead let's calmly ask for light to be brought that we may be found faithfully and lovingly doing the work we've each been given.</p><p>Joel Warne, Plymouth</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN65961815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64FY-X281-DYRH-914T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 3, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSBS</classCode><className>CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922120CC</classCode><className>LAW ENFORCEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922120TM</classCode><className>SHERIFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001110</classCode><className>MEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DPIQ</classCode><className>GEORGE FLOYD KILLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009P1Y</classCode><className>SOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST000DODC</classCode><className>BODY CAMERAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX614</classCode><className>MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, and I too mean business.</p><p>Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Tonight, Nigeria`s Electoral Commission is rejecting calls by opposition parties to schedule a new vote. Most parties say Saturday`s presidential election was tainted by violence, rigging, as well as voter intimidation and they`ve lost faith in the process. Partial results give the lead to the ruling party`s candidate Bola Tinubu. His party, the All Progressives Congress said on Monday the numbers don`t lie.</p><p>The Labour Party Chairman says otherwise. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIUS ABURE, NIGERIAN LABOUR PARTY CHAIRMAN: This election is not free, fair, and credible. It`s clear to all Nigerians that this election is already compromised.</p><p>And therefore, if that is the wishes and aspirations of every Nigerian, and is the general opinion, the best thing to do is for us to correct it and get it right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Let`s get more on all of this. Larry Madowo is in Lagos for us.</p><p>So Larry, three main opposition parties calling for a redo. What is the Electoral Commission saying? Will they call for fresh election?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The Electoral Commission is saying no can do, Isa, that this election was perfectly fine, and it is misplaced for these three political parties, the PDP that is the People`s Democratic Party, the other party that`s involved in this is the Labour Party, with Peter Obi, and the ADC, they called for the resignation of the Chair of the Electoral Commission and somebody from outside the Commission to run this fresh election, they want.</p><p>But this is the response from the Electoral Commission, I want to read a section of it for you now. They say that: \"Results emanating from the States points to a free, fair, and credible process. The 2023 General Election processes are in their final stages of completion. It is only fair for aggrieved parties to allow the conclusion of the process and approach the Courts with the evidence to pursue their cases.\"</p><p>That is the same thing that the APC, the All Progressives Congress, that is the ruling party is saying. Their candidate, Bola Tinubu is leading among the States that have so far been announced by INEC, the Electoral Commission.</p><p>I want to play for you some of that sound from the spokesperson,</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DELE ALAKE, SPOKESPERSON, APC: They say that the PDP and Labour Party won, the election was free and free there, but where they lost, the election was rigged there.</p><p>What kind of logic -- warped logic is that? What kind of reasoning? What kind of jaundiced perspective is that?</p><p>I know egocentrism and extreme selfishness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADOWO: And if this trend holds, then Bola Tinubu will be declared the next winner, and the next President of the Republic of Nigeria, and what is also likely to happen is that the opposition parties and their supporters will contest that outcome in Court, but also possibly on the streets, because there are Nigerians who feel disenfranchised who feel that there was a systematic attempt to suppress the vote and there is a collusion between the Independent National Electoral Commission and the government.</p><p>And they will want to have their voices heard, because as some of them told me, they are tired and they are taking their country back, whatever it takes. One man told me, \"I`m fighting for my daughter. She must have a better country. She must go to better schools and I`m willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that I can give her that\" -- Isa.</p><p>SOARES: And we`ve been hearing that sentiment on our air pretty much throughout the day in the last few days, I should say, Larry. One lady I heard saying on our air earlier today that Nigeria is at breaking point. Given you know what, you just outlined what we`re hearing on the streets as well, will anyone accept the result?</p><p>You hinted there potentially we might be seeing protests, people coming out if they don`t accept the result.</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>MADOWO: Everything I`m hearing from the streets points to that. That`s when if Bola Tinubu is declared the next President of Nigeria. Those who support the Labour Party, those who support the PDP will be so unhappy that they will want to declare their displeasure on the streets, because they have felt that the combined impact of the voter intimidation and the violence and the stolen ballots and the places where poll officials did not show up, was so extensive that it invalidates the entire election, and they feel that so because it`s not just a vote of saying that or the opposition, but also some observer nations have raised concerns about the process and the transparency.</p><p>Because now, it is a groundswell of opposition and criticism of the election, that you can see why people who already felt a little unhappy can say like, oh, everybody is saying it, so it must be true. And if Bola Tinubu wins, then they have to be out on the street saying no.</p><p>SOARES: Larry Madowo keeping a close eye on all the developments for us this hour in Lagos. Thanks very much, Larry.</p><p>Well, independent observers said Saturday`s election lacked transparency and fell short of reasonable expectations. Members of opposition parties walked out of the National Coalition Center as results were being announced.</p><p>The Chairman of the electoral body said candidates with complaints should take them to Court. He said they will continue to announce results, despite of course, the concerns that we`ve just been outlining -- that Larry has just outlined.</p><p>Sikiru Obarayese is a journalist with the \"Nigerian Tribune\" and he joins me now.</p><p>Sikiru, great to have you on the show.</p><p>Just clearly as Larry has just outlined for us, emotions are running high. Clearly, very tense right now, Nigeria. Give us a sense of how you`ve seen this election play out.</p><p>SIKIRU OBARAYESE, JOURNALIST, \"NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\": Yes, good to have me here.</p><p>Yes, so far, I think this election to talk about some organizations from political party have been thwarting this process, especially all the major opposition, the PDP, the Labour Party, the NNPP. So all of them, since from late yesterday, they said they don`t have a --</p><p>SOARES: Yes, you`re still with us, Sikiru. Keep going. Continue your thought.</p><p>OBARAYESE: Okay, so they are disappointed in it. All of them say they are disappointed in the process of these presidential election. Maybe, the credibility from the INEC, they are saying that the INEC has not been transparent in the process.</p><p>According to even in European Union -- the EU released a statement yesterday saying they lack transparency -- the process of this election lacks transparency.</p><p>More so that is the issues on this election. The first thing is we have some States Coalition Center who are declaring the election also. We cannot rely on what is coming out from the National Coalition Center, which is in Abuja.</p><p>And there from what is happening now in the National Coalition Center, I think for now, we have only eight States to go to declare among the 36 states -- (AUDIO ISSUES).</p><p>SOARES: We seem to have -- your signal seems to be frozen. We`re going to try. Do we still have him?</p><p>Let me just ask my producer to see if we have him. We have an unfortunate - - we`re going to try and reconnect and come back. Unfortunately, signal is not great. But we`ll stay on top of this story for you as soon as we get more details on the Nigerian election as these results keep coming in, of course, as we heard from Larry Madowo, we will bring it to you.</p><p>Now to Ukraine, soldiers so the situation in Bakhmut is increasingly difficult. One soldier told CNN, it is much worse than what has been officially reported. Still, they are disputing Russian claims that Ukrainian forces have been cut off. They say they will defend the city as long as possible.</p><p>Bakhmut has seen fierce fighting with grave casualties on both sides. Vladimir Putin speaking to the FSB admitted there had been Russian losses. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Unfortunately, there are losses in our ranks, the leadership of the FSB must do everything to provide additional support to the families of our fallen comrades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Well, despite that, Russian government video show advances on the ground.</p><p>Our Fred Pleitgen has more for you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian Defense Ministry video from the war in Ukraine showing Moscow`s troops on the move, gaining ground,, eating back gives forces, but the reality at least in some cases seems different.</p><p>These soldiers say they were mobilized from Irkutsk in Siberia and they are refusing to fight.</p><p>(UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>[15:10:08]</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice over): \"Due to the current state of affairs, we find ourselves in a desperate position as the Commanders do not care about our lives,\" he says. And later ads, \"We ask for help. We have nowhere else to turn.\"</p><p>The video was published as the Ukrainian say they`ve decimated Russian forces trying to assault Vuhledar in Eastern Ukraine, and after a public spat between Yevgeny Prigozhin of the Wagner private military company and the Russian Defense Ministry over ammo supplies to Wagner mercenaries around Bakhmut.</p><p>Well, Prigozhin says the issue has been resolved. He took another swipe at the Defense Ministry.</p><p>(YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN speaking in foreign language.)</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice over): \"A big number of former soldiers who are now part of Wagner came here because they were looking for more creative freedom, since everyone understands the Army doesn`t always enable that.</p><p>When we asked Prigozhin whether ties with the Defense Ministry have been restored, a snarky answer.</p><p>\"Guys, you`re CNN. Enemy spies. Have a conscience. How can I discuss military issues with you,\" he wrote on his social media channel.</p><p>Wagner`s forces say they`ve gained ground around Bakhmut this weekend. Russian state media released this drone footage of the utter destruction there and the Ukrainians claimed Wagner`s losses are immense.</p><p>Former Putin adviser, Sergei Markoff tells me he doesn`t believe Prigozhin uses his forces as cannon fodder because he owns them.</p><p>SERGEI MARKOFF, FORMER PUTIN ADVISER: They have storming group, but Prigozhin according to my information, he try to preserve their life because it`s their lives, his property, and he is a businessman.</p><p>PLEITGEN (on camera): Their lives are his property.</p><p>MARKOFF: Yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice over): But while progress is hard to come by for his army, Russian President Vladimir Putin shows no signs of backing down, instead proclaiming the Ukraine war to be a conflict with the West.</p><p>PUTIN (through translator): They have one goal, to break up the former Soviet Union and its main part, the Russian Federation. For what? To push the remnants around and put them under their direct control.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Fred Pleitgen reporting there.</p><p>In the last 24 hours, governments and institutions in the United States, EU, as well as Canada have ordered staff to wipe TikTok from their devices. And in America, Congress will soon vote on a bill that will make it easier for Joe Biden to ban the Chinese-owned app right across the country.</p><p>That story for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:08]</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back, everyone.</p><p>Well, a bill that would make it easier for the Biden administration to ban TikTok in the United States is expected to advance in Congress today.</p><p>It comes as the White House orders all Federal agencies to delete the Chinese-owned app from government used devices within 30 days. The EU Parliament announced a similar ban, if you remember today, as did Canada yesterday.</p><p>They are the latest efforts really to address security concerns around data gathered by TikTok.</p><p>Well, here is Beijing`s response to the US move. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAO NING, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): I can`t believe that the United States as the world`s number one superpower is so afraid of a mobile phone app popular amongst young people.</p><p>This shows a lack of confidence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: And Clare Duffy joins me now from New York.</p><p>So, Clare, how much support is there for this bill that the House is discussing? And could we be looking here at a complete ban?</p><p>CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Right, Isa. This bill, I think is still sort of a long way from becoming law, but we have seen a really significant increase in concern amongst lawmakers about the influence that TikTok has and the amount of data that China could gather from US TikTok users through its parent company ByteDance.</p><p>And so I do think this is a major concern for TikTok. The company has been working for the past two years to come up with a deal with the US government that would allow it to continue operating in the US, to address some of these National Security concerns. And I think this sort of shows just what a big challenge it is going to be to come to that agreement.</p><p>TikTok says that if the US were to ban the app, it would amount to censoring the more than 100 million American users. It says there is no evidence that the app presents a risk. But again, I mean, I think this is a big hurdle for the company to overcome in terms of regaining lawmaker trust.</p><p>SOARES: Meanwhile, we have the EU, the US, I believe, Canada as well telling employees to delete the app. How much impact really, Clare, will this have? Will it make a dent at all on TikTok`s business here?</p><p>DUFFY: I`m not sure that these government bans of the app are going to have a really significant impact on the app. It`s not clear just how many government phones had the app downloaded. You know, maybe there`s a social media app in some of these government -- a social media manager in some of these government agencies that were using the app.</p><p>But I do think that again, this just sort of shows the risk to the broader TikTok usership, not only in the US, but around the world. If some of these governments decide to move forward with these broader bans, it could have a huge impact. TikTok is one of the most popular apps among US mobile phone users, especially the crucial teen and young person market, and so this is a big risk to the company`s business.</p><p>SOARES: How much of this, Clare, is surveillance concerns? I know you touched on that. How much is this competition concern? I`m thinking here of Twitter, and Instagram, and the likes.</p><p>DUFFY: I think there is a bit of that sort of competition concern and just concern about what a significant impact this app has on American users on young people and culture, but I think the larger part of the concern is this worry about the potential access of US user data in China.</p><p>US lawmakers were concerned that the Chinese government could pressure TikTok`s parent company, ByteDance to hand over user data, including IP addresses, location, that sort of thing and use that for information, use it for disinformation, and so I think that`s the major concern.</p><p>There is no evidence that that`s been done before, but independent security experts have told CNN that it is possible.</p><p>SOARES: Yes, and it seems to be getting support at least from both sides of the aisle in the United States, which is saying something.</p><p>DUFFY: Rare.</p><p>SOARES: Clare Duffy, really appreciate it. Absolutely. I appreciate it. Thanks, Clare.</p><p>Well, the US has also tried to counter China on semiconductors. The Biden administration has $39 billion on the table to boost domestic production, but the grants and loans have some big strings attached.</p><p>Rahel Solomon is in New York with the details.</p><p>So, this is all about, Rahel, designed to kind of counter China and its dominance. So talk us about the string -- the so-called circle strings being attached.</p><p>RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Isa, as you said, this is look, a lot of money, but some would also say comes with a lot of strings.</p><p>So the first string is that companies that benefit from this type of funding may not expand their capacity in China for at least a decade. As you said, this is all about reducing reliance on China, so it would be a bit counterproductive if some of these companies then expanded in China in a decade. So that`s the first major string.</p><p>The second string is that companies that receive money will be prohibited from conducting joint research with a foreign entity of concern. That is a National Security concerns. So the administration essentially trying to make sure that this does not become a National Security issue.</p><p>And then the third string, Isa, which is actually getting the most attention is that companies must agree -- that receive this type of funding, that receive these grants -- must agree to share excess profits which also means no stock buybacks.</p><p>[15:20:07]</p><p>SOLOMON: President Biden has been very clear about how he feels about buybacks. Well, this is getting quite a bit of attention. And also these companies must agree to expand childcare. Part of this, Isa, is a domestic concern, right?</p><p>We have record low unemployment here in the US, 3.4 percent, but we also have a supply problem. We don`t have enough workers.</p><p>In fact, Diane Swonk of the KPMG accounting firm, the Chief Economist of KPMG, pointing out that labor force participation among women is dead last in the G20 nations. This is the top five. But you can see, you get the point here, right?</p><p>So she points out that lack of maternity leave and affordable childcare options are the main reasons. So, interesting, however, to see that type of legislation included in this larger CHIPS Act.</p><p>But to your larger question, Isa, Will this be enough to boost production? I talked to one analyst who follows these types of Apple and tech companies very closely. He said, look, it`s a great first step. It`s a decade late, and it`ll be like climbing an Everest uphill.</p><p>SOARES: Well, that says everything. I mean, I`m keen to know what you have heard from some of these companies? Would they -- are they prepared to take a bite out of this? I mean, do they even have the workforce to actually take this on? I mean, the challenge is -- it is appealing, but serious, not.</p><p>SOLOMON: It`s a great point, because you can make an economic case for both, right?</p><p>SOARES: Yes.</p><p>SOLOMON: I mean, you think about the challenges we had at the beginning of the pandemic with the supply chain, and how vulnerable we all realize we are, right, in terms of geopolitically, in terms of geographically when things happen. And so there is an economic case for broadening your supply chain.</p><p>On the other hand, it will be extremely expensive, and to your point, Isa, labor is just one part of it. As Dan Ives, that analyst told me before, this is an infrastructure, these are supply chains, these are workers, highly sophisticated technical workers who have had decades of sort of building up that infrastructure.</p><p>And he put it to me this way, he said, even for Apple -- Apple, of course, the main player here, right -- he said, for Apple to move five to seven percent of its production out of China, it would take two years and cost them five to eight billion dollars.</p><p>So lots of factors here. On the one hand, there is an economic case for starting to perhaps move some of your supply chain back to the US or to other parts of the world. On the other hand, it will be very expensive, and there are a lot of moving parts in terms of infrastructure that also have to be considered.</p><p>SOARES: Very good point. The infrastructure, but also I found it interesting, the research part, which I`m sure some companies will not be happy about.</p><p>Rahel Solomon, really appreciate it. Thanks very much, Rahel.</p><p>Now to a mystery from the natural world.</p><p>New research is underway to discover the cause of so-called \"zombie wildfires.\" They are blazes that mysteriously come roaring back to life.</p><p>CNN`s Allison Chinchar reports in the latest edition of \"Transformers.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice over): It`s summer in the remote boreal forests of Canada`s Northwest Territories. And Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon.</p><p>REBECCA SCHOLTEN, VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT AMSTERDAM: So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over and that is because of the underground burning that is happening.</p><p>CHINCHAR (voice over): In 2015, this region of boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire, also known as a zombie fire.</p><p>These are rare, so we don`t have any footage of them, but they can look just like these regular forest fires, except they`re back from the dead.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of the fire season, but instead they smolder deep into the organic soil layer and when the snow comes, the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions and that makes it possible for them to smolder all throughout winter.</p><p>And when the snow melts, and there`s dry fuels available again, these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire.</p><p>CHINCHAR (voice over): In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD.</p><p>For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in Southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles. Winter came and snow covered the fire site, but the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar, evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire.</p><p>By burning through the soil and the roots, zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover. But that`s not all, these boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p><p>[15:25:12]</p><p>CHINCHAR (voice over): Zombie fires are rare, but Scholten found they are increasing due to climate change.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So I think, zombie fire is a very good poster child for what is happening to Arctic wildfires in general. So we see fire regimes are intensifying and this has very important impacts on the ecosystems that of course has an impact on our climate and that is why I think everyone in the world should care about these fires.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Indeed, well still come right here, the Canals of Venice have long drawn visitors from around the world. Now they`re running dry, the Deputy Mayor of Venice is with me, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SOARES: Welcome back, everyone.</p><p>Now Rishi Sunak went to Northern Ireland today to promote his new trade deal with the EU. The British Prime Minister needs broad support in Northern Ireland for the arrangement to work.</p><p>It aims to resolve post-Brexit questions about how to handle Customs there. It is a political gamble for Mr. Sunak who has been in office just for months. He puts a positive spin though on Northern Ireland`s predicament.</p><p>Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RISHI SUNAK, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Northern Ireland is in the unbelievably special position, unique position in the entire world, European continent in having privileged access not just to the UK home market, which is enormous, fifth biggest in the world, but also the European Union single market. Nobody else has that. No one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Yes, unique position.</p><p>While the Prime Minister tries to sort out trade in Northern Ireland, British shoppers are having a hard time though finding common items like tomatoes, cucumbers, as well as peppers. It has led to rationing, which could last for weeks to come.</p><p>I took a closer look at the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:30:17]</p><p>SOARES (voice over): Row upon row of empty baskets, empty shelves. A supply gap in fruit and veg has hit U.K. supermarkets. The shortages affecting shoppers nationwide.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I went for lunch and I could not find, like, tomatoes, cucumber or lettuce.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was quite annoying when you want to have a day in (ph) and you can`t actually get it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The fruits are (INAUDIBLE) they are gone. Nothing there.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): To deal with the shortages, major British supermarkets are imposing limits on items like tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. The U.K.`s minister for the environment, food and rural affairs said the disruption should only last a few weeks and meanwhile, encouraged people to eat more seasonally.</p><p>Let them eat turnips, she said.</p><p>THERESE COLLEY, BRITISH MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS: I`m conscious that consumers want year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets and food and growers -- food producers and growers around the world are trying to satisfy. SOARES (voice-over): Supermarkets are blaming the recent shortages on poor weather conditions in key growing regions. Britain produces a fraction of the food it consumes, relying instead on overseas imports.</p><p>And key suppliers in southern Europe and North Africa, in particular Spain and Morocco, have seen harvests hit by extreme weather conditions.</p><p>While climate change plays a significant role in warmer than average temperatures, the government faces another inconvenient truth: Brexit, the cause of widespread supply chain disruption.</p><p>LIZ WEBSTER, CHAIR, SAVE BRITISH FARMING: Because of the interruption with trade in Europe that underpin our food supply, it means that there`s less food coming in from Europe; we`re producing less food. So basically, our food security is in real trouble.</p><p>SOARES (voice-over): Labor shortages due to a lack of migrant workers and soaring energy prices following Russia`s invasion of Ukraine have pushed the gap even wider as farmers struggle with front end costs.</p><p>And those costs are passed on to the consumer, consumers already grappling with record high grocery prices and the worst cost of living crisis in decades.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: Let`s not mention Brexit.</p><p>From the U.K., to Italy, the iconic canals of Venice are running low. A dry winter has left gondolas stuck in the mud as you can see. Some water taxes are unable to operate. It is unusual for Venice, which is more often facing the threat of flooding. Environmental groups are raising the alarm. They say another drought could be on the way.</p><p>Last summer, some parts of Italy saw their worst drought in 70 years. Simone Venturini is Venice`s deputy mayor; he joins me now live from Italy.</p><p>Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us here. Look, for so many years we have seen, we`ve covered the flooding haven`t we in Venice. This is now changing quite rapidly with your waterways. They are running dry.</p><p>How concerned are you that what you`ve been seeing by the trends here?</p><p>SIMONE VENTURINI, VENETIAN DEPUTY MAYOR ASSESSORE: Yes, thanks for having me. Low tide in Venice happened as high tide. So during the year, some days we have a very low tide. In this case it`s just the combination of the astronomical tide, the high pressure and the wind from the north.</p><p>So nothing extraordinary, nothing to worry about. The real risk for Venice, of course, is the sea level rise. So this is the most important challenge that Venice, all I think, the city on the coast needs to tackle. So just a normal situation, just a few days during the year. Nothing to worry about.</p><p>Of course, we are dealing with high tide situation in Venice. This is the most important challenge. But we have a big news. So right now, the MOSE system is a big dam on the bottom of the sea. It protects Venice from the high tide, from the waves from the sea. It is working.</p><p>So after 20 years of construction, MOSE system works. And it is very important to the city because right now we are defended from the high tide situation.</p><p>SOARES: We saw you talking about Venice but we saw pictures, I believe, I think it was this year, last year, no, early this year in the Alps with less snow packing. So in terms of, you talked about what can be done from your perspective, the system you`ve got in place to control kind of the high tides, what is your biggest concern now?</p><p>Is the expectation that we will see more droughts this year?</p><p>VENTURINI: Drought is a problem in the north in the city of Venice. Of course it is mostly in the mountain and in the plains and the pasture of course. Venice is challenged. A long-term risk is due to the sea level rise.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>VENTURINI: So this is the most important long term problem for the city, as for New York, for Miami, for London, for other cities in Italy. In the short term, we are protected by the MOSE system of course. But in 100 years, nobody knows how high the sea will be. So this is the most important challenge, of course.</p><p>SOARES: What else can be done?</p><p>You are talking about the dam system.</p><p>Is there anything that can be done and more --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOARES: -- go ahead.</p><p>VENTURINI: Yes, we are constructing a system to make the floor of Venice higher. So St. Mark`s Square (ph), for example, is a very low floor. And sometimes the water arise in St. Mark`s Square and the church of St. Mark Square.</p><p>St. Mark`s -- Basilica San Marco, of course. And it is very dangerous for the mosaics, for the stones, for the marbles because it is salted water. So we are protecting the church, of course. And we are constructing a new floor on the square of San Marco that makes the floor higher so the water cannot touch it.</p><p>SOARES: Wow. Despite the pictures that you have just painted, really, people continue to turn out, right?</p><p>Continues to attract so many visitors. The last time I believe you spoke to our show here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, there was talk about a tourist tax.</p><p>What happened to that?</p><p>VENTURINI: Yes, everybody loves Venice. So we are attracting a lot of tourists. They most of it arrived in Venice with sentiment to (INAUDIBLE), to love the city, to respect it. Some tourists arrive just to hit a run situation. They arrive and they left in three hours.</p><p>So they leave nothing to the city and they consume the city. So we are working, we are discussing with the city council right now to start a booking system for a visit of the city. We have a small fee to pay if you are a big tourist.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SOARES: How much?</p><p>How much is that?</p><p>VENTURINI: -- the range would be from 3 -- from 3 to 10 euro, the range. It depends on the -- from the reservation in Expedia (ph). So the most booking period will be, of course, higher. And in the lower season, it will be lower. So in February, November, it will be lower, of course.</p><p>SOARES: And you think that is enough incentive to deter visitors?</p><p>VENTURINI: No, it is just a small piece of a big plan to attract not only less tourists but a different kind of tourists. We want -- we are switching from a quantity model, the more the merrier, in a quality model.</p><p>So we want a different kind of tourist, more respectful of the city, who can stay a bit more, maybe two nights, three nights, four nights, and enjoy the city in the night, in the day, in the afternoon and discover the place in the city, where nobody goes.</p><p>So the unbeaten path. And we are working to instruct the tourists to discover and get lost in Venice is the most beautiful thing that can happen. You get lost in Venice. I will advise everyone to get lost in Venice. Maybe in the evening.</p><p>So it is a big plan, with a lot of different pieces. Of course, the reservation, the booking system will be very big stones (ph) on this street (ph).</p><p>SOARES: That is a very good slogan. Get lost in Venice. I will keep that one. We really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us, thank you very much, sir.</p><p>VENTURINI: Thanks for having me, thank you.</p><p>SOARES: Now remember masks?</p><p>A few parts of Europe, here in the U.K., all the U.S. mandatory mask wearing seems like a thing of the past. But Hong Kong is now ending its COVID mask mandate, a restriction that has been in place from the start of the pandemic.</p><p>As of Wednesday, masks no longer will be required outdoors, indoors or even on public transport. Our Kristie Lu Stout has the story for you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the last places on the planet where you still have to wear a mask. But after almost three years of both indoor and outdoor use in public, Hong Kong is finally dropping its mask mandate.</p><p>I still have to wear this today because the mandate is not fully scrapped until Wednesday, March 1st. Hong Kong`s top leader, John Lee, made the announcement on Tuesday.</p><p>JOHN LEE, HONG KONG CHIEF EXECUTIVE: In order to give people a very clear message that Hong Kong is resuming normalcy,</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>LEE: I think this is the right time to make the decision.</p><p>STOUT (voice-over): For much of the past three years, Hong Kong and neighboring Macau both followed China`s strict zero-COVID policy. Macau dropped its mask restriction on Monday.</p><p>According to Dr. Karen Grepin of the University of Hong Kong, face masks have played an important role in reducing community transmission in Hong Kong but now that almost everyone is vaccinated and most people have also been infected, dropping the legal mandate is past due.</p><p>People can now do their own risk assessment to determine if they want to wear one or not.</p><p>STOUT: Hong Kong`s move to scrap masks comes after the government launched its \"hello, Hong Kong\" campaign to bring back tourists and international visitors and business people. Starting Wednesday, they can breathe easy with the mask mandate effectively over -- Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I`ll be back to the top of the hour as we make a dash for the closing bell. Up next, \"QUEST`S WORLD OF WONDER.\" That is for Richard.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST (voice-over): From the polo fields of Argentina, a game brought here by the British, to a very large clock tower in the heart of BA, all evidence of Argentina`s European and specifically British past.</p><p>People from the U.K. came here to help develop the country. And those immigrants donated this mini Big Ben and it became known as the Torre de los Ingleses. It`s the Tower of the English.</p><p>Those relations were destroyed in the early 1980s with the war in the South Atlantic. In 1982, I was 20 years old, a student finishing university. I remember the war very clearly. The man I am about to meet was also 20 years old.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>QUEST: But he was a conscript in the Argentine army. And he was being shipped off to what he calls the Malvinas.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MICHAEL SAVAGE, FORMER SOLDIER (voice-over): I had no practice, I had only one day rifle practice. And I never thought they would send me. So I told my mum that morning, having breakfast, they`re not sending me, I`m not a soldier.</p><p>A week later, I was huddling in a peat bank at the foot of Mt. Longdon, one of the fiercest battles.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): Michael Savage is proudly Argentinian. The product of Scottish and Irish grandparents, born here in Argentina, and one of whom even fought for the British in World War II.</p><p>While I was safe and a student, Michael, untrained and ill supplied, was one of thousands of conscripts sent by Argentina`s then military government to invade what I call the Falklands.</p><p>I remember the night the Sheffield was sunk.</p><p>SAVAGE: Ah, yes. That was shortly after the Belgrano was sunk.</p><p>QUEST: And --</p><p>SAVAGE: So it was like England 1, Argentina 1, like a football match.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): I`m not here to rehash the war. I want to see it through Michael`s eyes. On opposite sides, I believe it will help me understand why nearly every Argentine still has such an emotional connection to the islands; perhaps because of stories like his.</p><p>SAVAGE: We looked like prisoners of a concentration camp. I had lost 22 kilos and my friends more or less the same. We had one that died sleeping one night of exposure.</p><p>QUEST: And once the fighting began ...</p><p>SAVAGE: Yes, I kept asking myself, what the hell am I doing here?</p><p>There should be a professional soldier here, not me.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): Eventually, Michael was taken prisoner and then repatriated to Argentina aboard a British cruise ship. He remembers translating for his troops and meeting a regiment of British paratroopers, who they had just fought against.</p><p>SAVAGE (voice-over): I thought there would be a fight on the ship but I was surprised by two or three paras talking with two or three of my fellow conscripts. They talked about football. They talked about music -- the British bands, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Supertramp -- and they talked about girls, conversations that a 20-year old have normally.</p><p>And that made me understand that wars are anonymous. When you engage into a face to face human exchange, the war would be impossible.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): It is in that spirit that Michael and I visit the memorial to the 649 Argentinians who died fighting in the war. I pay my respects to them and the 255 of my own country men, who perished on the fields of battle. No matter how many memorials are built here, how many never agains are said, war it seems, won`t go away.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): It is the other sound of Argentina, rivaling tango in the national psyche.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): An hour out of the capital and I am amongst grazing cattle, where the famous beef is reared on the pampas grass plains.</p><p>EVA BOELCKE, OWNER, EL OMBU DE ARECO (voice-over): Well, my grandfather bought the farm in 1934.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): 1934?</p><p>BOELCKE (voice-over): Yes.

Maybe it`s the horse. It could be my compadres. I am feeling gaucho. It is beautiful, absolutely glorious.</p><p>Forgive me. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS after all.

There we go.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Look at that.</p><p>VIAGGIO (voice-over): Here in Argentina, like the ribs. If you do a barbecue here in Argentina, the people, they want this.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): I am a true city dweller, sometimes squeamish about the fact that the cow I was wrangling yesterday is on the grill tomorrow.</p><p>I don`t want to start a worldwide debate but here is the beef. And is it the best in the world?</p><p>VIAGGIO (voice-over): (INAUDIBLE) sausage, you have some blood sausage. We have the chicken here. If you go to any house here in Argentina, they are going to have something small like this one but they will have this system, no.</p><p>You want to have friends and we want to be together, they call me and say, you want to hop on a saddle (ph) today?</p><p>A saddle means just come to my house or something like that. And we share the moment. Yes?

I don`t know whether the best comes from Argentina.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): But it`s bloody good.</p><p>The estancia is a fundamental part of Argentinian history and life, maybe far removed from today`s living. But coming here has widened and deepened my understanding of this tremendous country.</p><p>A trip to the estancia is the perfect way to end a visit to Buenos Aires. And so, to the word that describes all of this, I think it is invigorating. To be sure, Argentina has its challenges.

We have a look at the Dow, off 119 points, just over half a percent.</p><p>Not much, in terms of when we started the show almost an hour ago. It`s near, in fact, a session low.

The Dow, 1 percent.</p><p>Look at the Nasdaq, just practically flat in terms of how they fared for the month. It`s been a bit of a mixed picture. One down 1 percent, the other about a percent higher.

More people are getting vaccinated, but transmission rates in communities are still high, with 94% of U.S. counties classified as areas of high transmission. Amid the recent surge of infections and hospitalizations with Delta variant, people have questions about how well vaccines protect against COVID-19 infection.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To answer these questions, Jodie Guest, professor and vice chair of the department of epidemiology at Emory's Rollins School of Public Health, spoke with Jay Varkey, associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and hospital epidemiologist at Emory University Hospital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their conversation is part of an online video series hosted by Guest, who also leads the Emory COVID-19 Outbreak Response Team, addressing topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Watch the full conversation between Guest and Varkey here.</p><p>Q: What is a breakthrough infection?</p><p>A: A breakthrough infection occurs when a person tests positive for COVID-19 more than 14 days after completing a vaccination series. This would be two weeks after the second dose of Pfizer or Moderna or two weeks after the single dose of Johnson and Johnson vaccine.</p><p>Q: Are breakthrough cases expected?</p><p>A: \"Absolutely,\" Varkey says. \"It is totally normal and expected that there will be breakthrough infections, especially now when there is substantial or high transmission in close to 96% of the country.\"</p><p>Even the most effective vaccines cannot prevent infection 100% of the time. However, COVID-19 vaccines have proven highly effective at preventing severe illness and death due to COVID-19.</p><p>Q: How well do vaccines protect people against severe disease and hospitalization?</p><p>\"The data that we have today show that these vaccinations are performing excellent so far even including the Delta variant at what they were designed to do, which is prevent severe illness and death,\" Varkey says.</p><p>The CDC recently published research showing that unvaccinated individuals are five times more likely to become infected, 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than vaccinated individuals.</p><p>While there are some fully vaccinated patients with COVID-19 who are in the hospital, these individuals are typically immunosuppressed, over the age of 70 or are hospitalized for reasons unrelated to their COVID-19 infection.</p><p>\"At this stage, hospitals are disproportionately full of folks who are unvaccinated,\" Varkey says.</p><p>Q: What kinds of symptoms can you get from a breakthrough case?</p><p>A: \"For most people who are vaccinated, their COVID-19 experience will be mild,\" but symptoms can range in severity, Varkey says. Some people may remain asymptomatic, while others have mild symptoms or \"a case of the sniffles.\" Others may feel like they have a bad cold, or that they have \"the worst flu of their life, but not necessarily sick enough to be in the hospital.\"</p><p>Like anyone who is infected with COVID-19, individuals with breakthrough cases are also at risk of developing long COVID symptoms. However, early data suggest that vaccinated individuals may be at lower risk.</p><p>Q: Are breakthrough cases infectious?</p><p>A: A person with a breakthrough case of COVID-19 can transmit infection, which is why masking is currently recommended even for those who are vaccinated when they are indoors in public spaces.</p><p>People with breakthrough cases may not be as infectious as those who are unvaccinated. Recent data on breakthrough cases among health care workers in the Netherlands \"found that though viral load levels were the same with vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated samples, unvaccinated people were 25% more likely to be infectious compared to those who were vaccinated,\" Guest says.</p><p>People with breakthrough cases are also infectious for fewer days than those who are unvaccinated. \"We're most contagious to those around us, so the people that we live with our spouse, our kids, a grandparent that might be in the house, our coworkers they are less at risk if you are vaccinated, because you will be infectious for a shorter period of time,\" Varkey says.</p><p>Q: What can vaccinated people do to prevent breakthrough infections, and how concerned should they be about getting sick?</p><p>A: \"I think the concern that people have is warranted when community transmission is sky-high,\" Varkey says. \"But we are in such a better place now than we were a year ago this time because of vaccination.\"</p><p>Staying aware of areas of high transmission and continuing simple precautions such as wearing masks indoors in public, safely distancing and carefully washing hands can mitigate the risk of infection.</p><p>\"We don't want to be wearing our masks forever, but they help us keep transmission down,\" Guest says. Varkey calls masking in indoor spaces with people outside of your household \"the easiest, most sensible precaution that has worked throughout this pandemic.\"</p><p>\"Rather than panic, it's always good to prepare,\" Varkey adds. \"This is really the end game of the pandemic it's not going to be turning a faucet off. It's going to be us learning how to safely live with this virus.\"</p><p>Q: When will the pandemic end?</p><p>A: \"In a post-pandemic world, if the vast majority of people who get COVID-19 have essentially a case of the sniffles or a minor cold that keeps them at home out of work for a few days but doesn't land them in the hospital, doesn't land them on a respirator, doesn't end up with them dying I would totally be willing to accept that,\" Varkey says, but because so many Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, \"we're just not there yet.\"</p><p>\"Vaccines continue to help keep us safe on the individual-level: they keep us from getting as sick or needing to go into the hospital,\" Guest says. \"They also help on a population-level: a vaccinated person plays less of a role in the transmission process than a person who is unvaccinated and fewer cases keeps those who cannot yet be vaccinated safer and gives the virus fewer places to mutate. This will help us end the immense suffering of the pandemic.\"</p><p>\"If you think about COVID as a fire and if you think about these waves as a forest fire, vaccinated people are like wet logs,\" Varkey says, borrowing a metaphor from colleague and Emory anesthesiologist Michelle Au. \"Unvaccinated people are like dry kindling. Delta is the accelerant, almost like gasoline on the fire.\"</p><p>While a wet log can catch and spread fire, \"it is much harder to start a fire with a wet log and nearly impossible when there's no kindling,\" he continues. In the same way, vaccination is a critical tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124724580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NF-NVV1-DYTH-G28R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 20, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In addition to the corona epidemic of last year, we have to take actions against the sufferings, pain and outbreaks of seasonal disasters, economic imbalance, political upheaval, icy storms, oceanic cyclones, floods, forest fire, global warming; this will also be the new resolution of the upcoming year. We have to resolve and take an oath that in the coming year we will not do anything that puts a question mark on our objectives, hopes, aspirations and ideals. We have to give a new colour and shape to our lifestyle in the new year amidst the sound of the third wave of the corona epidemic i.e. Omicron.</p><p>The corona pandemic has disturbed our way of life. Welcoming the New Year, it was not unusual for us to wish that we would regain the glory of our lost ideal and balanced life and once again the harmony would be established in our lifestyle. But if we take stock of the situation on the passing of the complex phase of Corona and welcome the New Year, then our national, social, family and personal life values, economic conditions, business, employment and functionalities are visible in fragments. During this, Corona forced the entire humanity to kneel on its knees. So far 270 million, more than 65 lakh people have been infected all over the world. Of these, about 54 lakh lost their lives. In India too, this figure has gone up to five lakh. India is counted among the top five countries to be victims of this tragedy. Not only did people die from Corona, but a large number of people also became victims of misery. However, it was a matter of comfort during this time that the central and state governments did not hesitate to fight the epidemic. Two vaccines made in India gave people the strength to deal with this life-threatening disaster. Due to the resolution of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, since January 16, more than one billion, 400 crore doses have been given. Not only this, there were efforts to bring back the economic growth rate, but it will take a long time to heal the wound of the epidemic and defeat Omicron.</p><p>In the last year, we have been forced to drink bitter sips of economic imbalance. During this, the gap of economic inequality in India widened further. In India, 57 per cent of the country's total income went into the pockets of the top 10 per cent. Half of the population earned only 13 per cent.</p><p>Efforts made in the past to eradicate the poverty line, have again engulfed the blind den of poverty. The poor countries of the world will have to fight for self-reliance very fast. The coming years are sure to be of economic nationalism.</p><p>Now, not ignoring the threat of Omicron, both the government and society have geared up to deal with it, but when the results will come, how many will come, no one has any guarantee. It is still unknown how deadly Omicron is going to prove to be. Precaution and vigilance are very important, the government wants to make the life of every person advanced, healthy and prosperous, but progress starts getting blocked the day we stop paying attention to our shortcomings and errors. This situation makes a person do such things, which later on prove to be harmful to him. Our flawed lifestyle makes up for it. If there is an imbalanced life then a person cannot think positively. The question to consider is, for what purpose should life be lived? The question that should be in front of every person is why am I living? If we consider the purpose of life, then a new reality will come to the fore and the question of the style of life will also come to the fore.</p><p>The crisis is not only of the corona epidemic, there are many other crises. China and Pakistan are creating conditions of unrest and war on the borders. Not only did the coronavirus that came from China attack India, but its forces also tried to break the limits and cross the borders. Last year, 21 army personnel including a lieutenant colonel were martyred in Galwan. In the year 2021, blood was not shed again on the border, but the series of unprecedented and dangerous tensions continued. Will China's attempt to cross its borders be curbed next year? Not only this, but the return of the Taliban to power in Afghanistan is also a crisis for India. Due to the strong intentions of the Central government, the conflict between India and Pakistan may not have taken the shape of a major conflict, but in 2021 shells and bullets from across the border have so far swallowed more than 35 soldiers. Drones coming from Pakistan also became a cause for concern this year. Disturbing Kashmir once again and increasing terrorist activities there has become a matter of concern. The Home Ministry of the country and the government of Kashmir together killed about 100 terrorists.</p><p>Amid situations of violence, terror and war, India has also created a unique environment of cultural and religious uplift; a unique initiative has been taken to restore India's pride. With the beginning of the construction of the Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya last year, the inauguration of the Vishwanath Dham complex in Varanasi this month can be said to be a special initiative to give a new dimension and vision to the political thinking of India. Our country's religious-cultural traditions and ideal values of life have been rich and strong, but the previous governments have tarnished their pride by giving them political views. But the new political thinking and power have attracted India to the world with its cultural and religious splendour, which can be called a happy event of the past year. Certainly, Kashi and Ayodhya will become the basis of a strong India by becoming a symbol of nationality.</p><p>This will not only provide a lot of convenience to the pilgrims going there but will also give dignity to a symbol of faith and civilization shrinking in narrow circles. Inaugurating the first phase of the Kashi complex grandly and gracefully, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has made every Indian feel self-faith, self-culture and self-existence. India's cultural splendour has been unmatched in the world, but due to so-called political interests and narrow-mindedness, instead of bringing this glory in front of the world, there have been constant attempts and conspiracies to forget it. It is a happy situation that now the faith has been awakened to give shape to the dreams seen with our waking eyes, so this is giving an atmosphere and intention to protect life values and cultural heritage and to build a new India, which is auspicious for the new year. It is a sign of the emergence of a new and prosperous India.</p><p>The Union Cabinet has approved a proposal to increase the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. With the creation of this new system, there will be a new light in the life of women. One destination, one direction and one way, yet there have been many inequalities in the life of man and woman, two forces of society were moving back and forth. To remove such discrepancies and inequalities, there has been a knock on the door of thinking many times, but the door is open for the first time. The past year has also inflicted an unimaginable wound, on December 8, India's first Chief of Defense Staff General Bipin Rawat, along with his wife and 12 associates, were killed in a helicopter crash. He was trying to give a new look to the Indian Army according to the new requirements. His tragic death is a deep blow to this ambitious, but inevitable need. Amid these mixed conditions of joy and sadness, only that emotional moment is the meaning of life which we live with full awareness and that is the truth of the waking eyes which we aim to achieve. Only this wealth of truth and compassion can ensure our success in the upcoming New Year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTIL-0057678725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTIL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64FC-W2D1-DXMP-K3M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Omega Printers &amp;

As part of that priority, I have been honored to serve as Chair of the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), which I will discuss later.</p><p>Coconino County, the second largest county in the contiguous United States, consisting of 18,661 square miles of land, 27 percent, or over three million acres, of which are owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. We are home to the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in the world, making healthy forests one of our top interests and priorities as we work to protect lives and communities from the impacts of catastrophic wildfires and post-wildfire flooding.</p><p>In the past ten years, Coconino County has experienced four major wildfires on federal land that has negatively impacted us through the tragic loss of life, homes and businesses, decreased property values as well as social and economic burdens on our communities. Just one year ago in my district, the Museum Fire, which burned less than 2,000 acres, cost the U.S. Forest Service over $11 million to suppress and rehabilitate and cost Coconino County nearly $2 million in response to the post-wildfire flooding threat to the City of Flagstaff.</p><p>While forest restoration has been on the hearts and minds of our citizens for years, we are currently in the eighth year of a ten-year landscape scale restoration project called the Four Forest Restoration Initiative or 4FRI, an effort to restore 300,000 acres of forest over 10 years. In those eight years, the contractor has only been successful at treating 14,000 acres. While there are many factors that have played into the small amount of acres being treated, the lack of a market for the biomass (non-merchantable trees, limbs and tops) that is created from forest restoration treatments continues to be the bottleneck.. This is quite evident by the fact that a mere 125 miles away, where a bioenergy plant is located in Snowflake, Arizona, industry has been able to treat over SIX TIMES as many acres in the same timeframe precisely because there is a market for biomass. Support for biomass energy facilities as well as the \"High Hazard Area Wood Biomass Fund\" in S. 4603 to fund the processing, removal and hauling of biomass to end markets that can be hundreds of miles away from the source, is critical for increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration on federal lands.</p><p>In the early 1990's, much of Arizona's forest industry \"left town\" due to increasing litigation on federal timber sales. Add to that the Forest Service policy to put every forest fire out, we have created conditions where the forest is overstocked with trees and is a virtual tinderbox waiting to combust. Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute cites that pre-1900, tree densities in Arizona's forests averaged around 24 trees per acre due to the frequent lightning caused fires naturally thinning the forest. However, that average today has skyrocketed to well over 1,200 trees per acre. The goal of forest restoration is to reduce the tree density to a healthy average of 80 trees per acre, allowing for the re-introduction of wildfire back into our fire adapted ecosystem. Attempting to do that work primarily through prescribed fire is too risky and not feasible based on the current density of trees. However, mechanical thinning treatments brings a multitude of benefits, although success depends on markets being made available for the forest products and biomass. One of the greatest benefits of mechanized thinning operations, aside from creating a healthy, fire-resistant forest, is the creation of well-paying jobs in some of the most rural areas of the country where they are desperately needed.</p><p>Biomass energy plays a significant role in the success rate of forest restoration in Arizona and yet has struggled to get support from state and federal lawmakers. Biomass energy is the only viable option, at this time, in our efforts to thin 30,000 to 50,000 acres per year for the next twenty years as we work diligently to improve forest health and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires across the West. We often look only at the cost of bioenergy when determining its viability and knowing that it has a higher cost than green energy systems like solar and wind. Therefore, it often gets overlooked. However, we must not forget that the ecosystem benefits resulting from forest restoration treatments that supply the biomass for energy, is creating healthy forests and watersheds, improved wildlife habitat, protecting communities and lives from catastrophic wildfires and the negative air quality impacts, as well as recreational and economic opportunities within our national forest lands. S. 4603 is critical for support of biomass removal from federal lands and biomass energy to reduce the amount of carbon emissions from wildfire, open-burning fire and prescribed fire. In addition, the financial impact from forest restoration, made possible by having biomass energy as an end market for forest by-products, is the reduction of catastrophic wildfires that have cost the federal government nearly $3.4 billion in suppression costs alone in 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Furthermore, it is estimated that the total economic impact from wildfires in 2020 will reach between $130 to $150 billion in losses.</p><p>The facts on the ground in our region prove out the need for biomass as a tool to dispose of the forest products in our area. Senator McSally's legislation, S. 4603, is a critical step towards creating this policy goal and funding that will plant the seeds for biomass utilization in forest restoration efforts in Arizona and elsewhere across the West.</p><p>In Arizona, where we have only one 30 MW bioenergy plant, there is a need for an additional 90 MW of biomass energy to consume the biomass residue that will be produced from the Four Forest Restoration Initiative. Over the last several years, the bioenergy facility captured over 98 percent of the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 created by burning biomass for energy. The EPA has published that \"Wildland fires now account for 40 percent of the total PM emitted in the country, making it a major source of the pollutant, which causes lung and health problems.\" Consider that against all particulate matter emitted from vehicles, power generation, industrial facilities, etc. forest fire represents 40 percent of the PM emitted.</p><p>In conclusion, it is critical that the federal government upholds its responsibility to the American people in supporting the most viable and economic way to dispose of the millions of tons of small diameter trees, limbs and tops (biomass) that result from forest restoration projects across the West and more specifically in Arizona, where there are no other industry markets available, allowing for more acres to be treated each year. Without your support, we will continue to see catastrophic wildfires ravage the landscape and watersheds, turning once beautiful forests into a desolate wasteland of ash and dust. I applaud the subcommittee for holding this important hearing today and urge you to pass S. 4603 to protect our fragile forest ecosystem in the West.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/DD79F41D-1E31-4CED-A142-4C9F8E0621FB\">https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/DD79F41D-1E31-4CED-A142-4C9F8E0621FB</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSCB18011K5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61BD-7FP1-JCCP-00HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1344\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 18, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is our home,\" said D'Angora, who celebrated his 30th birthday, his 40th birthday and his wedding rehearsal at the historic cafe. \"This is the place we're going to come back to and talk about how the pandemic did us wrong.\"</p><p>Olsen first opened West Bank at its current location, 407 W. 42nd St., back in 1978. The name (unrelated to the Middle East territory) originated from a conversation between him and his then-business partner on a drive down to the Bowery.</p><p>\"He wanted to name it Left Bank, and I said no, that's French,\" said Olsen. \"It's on the west side, so he said [how about] West Bank ... We kept it, and the name just caught on.\"</p><p>Since then, the venue has hosted hundreds in showbiz, like playwright Tennessee Williams and comedian Joan Rivers, who performed over 200 sets at the cafe - including her last stand-up act the night before she died.</p><p>Yet coronavirus forced Olsen to shut down all performances and let go of 47 employees earlier this year. He and his staff of six have continued to operate the restaurant four days a week, with Olsen doing a number of the deliveries himself.</p><p>Outdoor dining offered a brief respite this summer, but freezing temperatures began to keep the customers away - and Olsen had to consider whether or not he should shut the doors for good.</p><p>\"After Thanksgiving, the business just fell off a cliff. It just stopped,\" said Olsen, who opened the caf\u00e9 when he was only 24 years old.</p><p>\"You're bringing in $300 a day ... It's a big hit. I was completely sweating it,\" said Olsen, who couldn't fall asleep until 8 a.m. some days. \"I didn't know which fork in the road we were going to go down.\"</p><p>Olsen said West Bank still has a ways to go - but the money pouring in will help keep the cafe afloat until its next opening night.</p><p>\"You get so caught up in trying to just keep your head above water, you forget why people like the place,\" he said. \"We're not out of the woods, but this has been completely uplifting. \"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYNWS-NY0114353084</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VY-7BN1-JBM5-R4DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Daily News, L.P.

Jared Polis and other officials who spoke at a press conference Friday morning. It's the most destructive fire in Colorado history. </p><p><br/> Believed to have been caused by electrical lines that were blown down, the fire started on Thursday afternoon[1] and by Friday morning was not expected to grow beyond its 6,000-acre extent. Crews on Thursday also responded to the Middle Fork Fire, just north of Boulder around North Foothills Highway and Middle Fork Road. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe\">https://coloradonewsline.com/subscribe</url><br/>Officials during the press conference \u2014 which included Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, Lafayette resident Rep. Joe Neguse, and Sen. Michael Bennet \u2014 struggled to capture in words the ferocious speed and scale of the fires, which were unusual for occurring so late in December and in a highly developed suburban area. <br/> 'Unprecedented,' is how Neguse described the flames. 'They moved through neighborhoods with a speed and a magnitude like we have never seen before. And we know already that the damage will be costly and disastrous.' <br/><br/>Polis said, 'There's no technology or equipment that's available to have halted this kind of fire in its tracks.' On Thursday, Polis had said the fire moved so fast it sometimes overtook an area the size of a football field 'in a matter of seconds.' <br/> Experts already are pointing to climate change as a main factor in Thursday's events. 'The terrible firestorm was a result of a very warm, dry period combined with an extreme high wind event. There is a clear connection to CLIMATE CHANGE!' tweeted[2] Denver meteorologist Mike Nelson. <br/> Responders were still in the early stages of performing structure-to-structure damage assessments, and residents who were evacuated were precluded from returning to their homes. Pelle said it would take 'at least a day' to carry out the assessments, after which staff will post a map at the website of the Boulder Office of Emergency Management[3] showing structure status by address. <br/> Pelle characterized the number of destroyed homes by saying, 'I would estimate it's going to be at least 500 homes. I would not be surprised if it's a thousand.' <br/> The worst-hit areas appear to be in the north part of Superior and southern Louisville. Both communities, comprising more than 30,000 residents, were evacuated Thursday. Every one of the 370 homes in Superior's Sagamore neighborhood appear to have been burned. In Old Town Superior, as many as 210 homes were lost. Many businesses were also destroyed. Superior Marketplace, a shopping plaza that includes a Super Target, burned, and the Element hotel in Superior was 'fully engulfed.' <br/><br/>Dozens of evacuated Superior residents and friends of residents gathered Friday morning on a ridge along Colorado 128 south of Superior's Rock Creek subdivision, which offered a panoramic view of smoldering neighborhoods. They scanned the scene, trying to determine the condition of their homes. One woman asked Denver Post photographer RJ Sangosti to zoom in on a home so she could assess it on his camera's digital screen. She burst into tears when she saw that it appeared to have survived. <br/> Jola Gaik, who lives with her daughter in Rock Creek, similarly determined with the aid of binoculars that she would have a home to return to. She had been working in nearby Erie when flames approached her neighborhood, and had seen the fire from afar. <br/> 'It looked horrifying and devastating,' she said. 'It is the most horrible thing you can see.' <br/> An evacuation order barred her from returning home and, having stayed at a friend's house in Arvada, she was still in the clothes she was wearing Thursday. A neighbor had rushed into her home to collect important documents for her. <br/> Bill Wright and his wife have lived in Rock Creek since 1994. At around the time the fire started he was on his way to aid a friend who was climbing on the Flatirons and, hampered by high winds, needed help. Wright's wife had also left their house before the fire swept through the neighborhood. On Friday morning he arrived at the ridge south of Rock Creek and, after he and another resident walked into the neighborhood, determined that his house had survived. He said damage in Rock Creek was intermittent. <br/> 'When a house got hit it's completely gone to nothing but brick, pillars, I mean flat,' he said. 'So if you burned, you're gone completely. Nobody's got partial damage.' <br/> He also found many homes that were completely untouched. In some areas, homes on one side of the street were standing, but on the other side there was nothing left. <br/> When asked how he feels now about living in the area, Wright said, 'You know, you see all those fires of people living up in the mountains and the forests, and I'm like, 'You know, that sucks for those guys for sure, but like, you live in a forest. There's going to be a forest fire.' But we're out here in the freaking plains. I didn't think we had enough to possibly burn.' <br/>http://https://bouldercounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=13ab214fe2bb4da5a850df0ca0f00fc5 This map shows the area burned by the Marshall Fire, outlined in purple. Click on the map for an updated, interactive version. <br/>Polis on Thursday declared a state of emergency, and FEMA approved a federal Fire Management Assistance Grant[4] in response to the fire. President Joe Biden on Friday approved a major disaster declaration, 'which will be critical in terms of bringing federal resources here to Boulder County and to the many homeowners who have lost so much, for folks who are looking for housing assistance, small business assistance and so forth,' Neguse said. <br/> Polis spoke with Biden on Friday morning. 'The president assured him that every effort will be made to provide immediate help to people in the impacted communities,' according to the White House. <br/> Officials expressed amazement over how no one appears to have died in the fire. <br/> 'We might have our very own New Year's miracle on our hands if it holds up that there was no loss of life,' Polis said. <br/> 'It's unbelievable when you look at the devastation that we don't have a list of a hundred missing persons, but we don't,' Pelle said. 'So, again, I'm hoping that's a miracle, because it would be, given the circumstances.' <br/> A fire call center can be reached at 303-413-7730. <br/> The Boulder Office of Emergency Management[5] is providing updates on evacuations and other fire information. <br/> Ways to offer response assistance can be found at coloradoresponds.org[6]. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/donate\">https://coloradonewsline.com/donate</url><br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/grass-fires-rip-through-boulder-county-neighborhoods-burn-homes/\">https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/grass-fires-rip-through-boulder-county-neighborhoods-burn-homes/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MikeNelson247/status/1476993239294955522\">https://twitter.com/MikeNelson247/status/1476993239294955522</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boulderoem.com\">https://www.boulderoem.com</url>/ [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance\">https://www.fema.gov/assistance/public/fire-management-assistance</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.boulderoem.com\">https://www.boulderoem.com</url>/ [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coloradoresponds.org\">https://www.coloradoresponds.org</url>/ </p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

I have multiple replacement parts and figured I probably wouldn't be going into the boundary waters again. But my father who was alive when fossil fuel was still walking finally passed away himself in early 2006. So now I had to make one more trip and take his ashes 'up there' for his last trip in. </p><p><br/>When talking about the task at hand, my twins (now entering college) said that they wanted to go with to spread 'Papa's' ashes. They had never been to the boundary waters and had never shown any interest in a trip of this kind before. Their idea of roughing it would have been the 'Holiday Inn without the pool.' So it was that they were now going to go on their first 'trip in.' Thus, the first and last trip in. <br/>I don't know what other rookies have pictured in their minds about going on a trip that requires portaging and paddling into the boundary waters, but I was told after, that it was 'a bunch easier than what they expected.' My son had expected that it would be a bunch harder than any of the training he had experienced for varsity sports and my daughter had also expected it to be more severe than her workouts during her high school tenure. (Both were athletes who worked hard at their chosen sports.) Apparently my talk of what it was like was much more slanted on the work side than on the pleasure side of the trips I had taken. The experience beats what you think it will be like, in that the rewards far exceed any of the pain that might have been endured. Besides, 'that long nasty portage can help you find out what you're made of.' Just don't use phrases like that to describe the experience or you scare away the first time trippers. We paired up one of the kids with an old partner from some of the previous trips I had taken in. So we were all set and just had to figure out what the agenda would be. <br/>How do you cram or show forty-five years worth of various experiences from different trips into the last one that you'll be able to take in? An experienced partner (Ken) was able to clarify and cull the agenda down to manageable goals. One trip does not a lifetime of 'trips in' make, but it can point at some of the highlights; especially if you spend most of the time in the present rather than bemoaning what 'it used to be like.' Live in the moment. (I usually don't.) Every other day was planned for recovery from the hard days, stay near base camp following each day trip that was taken. The use of a good outfitter with ultra lite equipment also made the trip more pain free and more doable. Everything was to be structured to be the easiest way possible while still seeing as much of the chosen area as possible. This wasn't going to be a forced march. <br/>We stopped on the way up to Ely, MN to dump half the ashes in Yellow Lake in northwest WI (another of the 'old man's' favorite places). Construction prevented us from getting to the lake and we settled on the Yellow River going into the lake. Also gave my daughter her first opportunity to go 'pee in the woods'. 'Damn it! I peed on my shoes.' Outdoor skills have to be learned. In order to get an early start and still be fresh on the first morning going in, we spent the night before in a motel in Ely. We also swapped out two of our packs for two of the outfitter's (theirs carried easier than the old Duluth pack and the WW II army issue with the heavy metal frame). We were told that it would take about four to four and a half hours to get to our destination. It took six, but I also heard the phrase 'When does it get hard?' (Oh to be eighteen again.) We got lucky and got the exact campsite that my partner from previous trips and I wanted to get. We got camp set, had supper and went to bed early as a storm blew in. Glad that it let us get everything set before the weather turned. As it happened, that was the only bad weather of the entire trip. <br/>The first full day in we decided to take the 'old man' (mine that is) to the island where he and I had spent a fair amount of time camped on previous trips. It's not an approved campsite now, so he won't be sharing it with anyone and will get to listen to the wolves, loons and other critters for eternity. Plus the kids now know where they have to take my ashes when my time comes. Then, off to Boulder Rapids to show them some things that don't change with time. The water levels might go up and down, but comparison of the pictures from previous trips show it's still the same as was forty five years ago. <br/>The second day in we decided to take a trip to Oyster Lake and maybe get a Lake Trout for dinner. This is where my age, replacement parts and how out of shape I really was started to show. Beautiful lake and wish we would have had more time to explore (they had the energy and all I had was the desire). The trout didn't cooperate and the best we could do was a couple of good strikes on my son's rod that refused to stay on or come up from the depths we had to fish (August). By the time we finished the last portage out I was one tired puppy and was soaking wet with sweat. I sat down on a rock to recover and wipe my glasses dry to be able to see again. Finished what was left of the water we had brought along and started the paddle back across Agnes to our base camp. Yep! You guessed it. When I got out of the canoe at camp I realized that the glasses were still on top of the rock at the portage to Oyster. Ironic that we found another pair of glasses at the end of the trail on Oyster's shore on the way in that morning. 'Pity the guy that lost them.' Now I was that guy. Again, it's good to be young and full of vinegar. They went back for the glasses while I prepared supper and they even had a swim at the beach by the portage. It's good when your kids don't make the mistakes, because their father would have had to yell at them; instead he ate humble pie by making the mistakes and being helped along when he wasn't able to carry his end of the bargain. We took the next day off so their 'old man' could recover by doing a little fishing on Agnes and planning what we might do on the following day. It was decided that we would go to Ramshead and Lamb the following day. <br/>Really glad that all that was loaded in the canoes was a daypack, because it was as I had remembered it to be when looking for the portage into Ramshead. Getting through the wild rice and other water plants in the low water to the portage was an experience for the kids. ('The African Queen' and Bogart come to mind.) I asked them how they would have enjoyed trying it with full gear in loaded down canoes. They didn't think much of the idea and while contemplating the idea my son stumbled on and scared off a moose as he entered the portage trail into Ramshead. 'Gee they make a lot of noise when they go charging off into the woods.' The idea behind the day trip was to bushwhack in on the eastern side of Lamb and see if we could find where an old ranger's cabin use to be before the last forest fire had gone through the area. Thankfully the portages into Ramshead and Lamb are fairly level and easy. Bushwhacking on the east side of Lamb however gave the kids a few scares as their 'old man' took a few spills on the steep terrain we were covering. My surgeon had suggested that I had 'no business going up there anymore and if I dislocated either of my new hips, they could just shoot me and leave me there.' They must have used good parts, because I came through with flying colors. (At least in my mind.) <br/>Didn't find the exact spot of the cabin, but think we got close. Again, we didn't have enough time for a good search of the area. We'll leave that search for another try on another day trip from the Nina Moose side without staying in the woods. (A couple hours in and a couple hours out with the rest of the time spent looking for the site.) It is just off the old portage trail that used to run between Nina Moose and Lamb. Both the old one and the new one are not a lot of fun to do. (The old one is basically non-existent now with the passage of time from its last use. Hint! There was however a spring for drinking water near its entrance on the Nina Moose side.) <br/>On the way out that day we ran into a party coming into Ramshead that made the comment that they had just run the 'portage from hell.' I suggested that if they thought that the one they just covered into Ramshead was bad, 'They were in for a real treat when they did the one from Lamb into Nina Moose.' (But that's another story for another time.) Had we not gone in earlier that morning and left a trail through the wild rice I question whether they would have found their way into the portage without a high degree of difficulty, if at all. Knowledge is power and can save a bunch of effort if you remember where things are located or know that the portage map runs true. <br/>After getting back to camp and thinking about the trip out in two days I told the kids and Ken that I wasn't interested in doing any day trips the next two days. I really wanted to have something left in the tank for the push out on the final day. I suggested that if the three of them wanted to go exploring they had my blessing without the company. (Truth be told, I knew that our little bushwhacking party was going to extort a price from me the next two days.) After looking at the possibilities, Ken decided that discretion was the better part of valor and we all stayed close to home the next two days. Some exploring of other campsites and areas around the lake by the three of them netted what was left of an antler shed from a moose for my son. In all the trips up there I had never found one, so he one upped me on that one. Sometimes it's better to have no agenda or set schedule of things to see and do. The kids were able to go off paddling by themselves and find out what the 'stern man's job' was all about.  <br/>The last night in it was very clear and Ken and I decided to roust the kids out of their sleeping bags to look at the stars. Living close to urban areas they had never seen anything like this before. Earlier on one of the other evenings we had also been given a slight glimpse of the Northern Lights. These types of sights are beyond description with words and for my money have to be experienced. Even with the early rising the following morning it was worth staying up until it was dark enough to enjoy the view. <br/>A little after six the next morning we had broke camp and were on the way out. I experienced the same feelings I always did when leaving the woods. The trips were always too short and especially this one because it was probably my last. The beavers had spent the week we were on Agnes in constructing a 'good bye present' in the form of a number of new dams on the Moose River for our trip out. The kids now know what 'busy as a beaver' means. Their comments about the trip while there and on the ride home surprised me some. They had really enjoyed it and my son said he would go back again. I told him that we should have done this earlier as I wouldn't be able to physically handle any further trips in. I would be unable to do the work as required. He suggested that all I would have to do would be able to walk in as he could do all the carrying. Unfortunately I don't think my pride would allow that. Time will tell. The scary part is the fact that on more than one occasion we ran into some ladies who I believe were in their seventies. One pair was doing a loop that covered more territory than I would have tried when I was half their age. Proof that for some, age is just a state of mind. <br/>The trip home in the van was supplemented with my daughter constructing a list of all the critters we had seen and/or heard. Heard but not seen, the wolf pups had been testing their new voices and learning to communicate with the pack. It had also caused her to want an escort to the facility at the back of the campsite. I understood why she wanted to sleep in the middle of the tent and not on the outside edge, but what she didn't realize was that she had nothing to fear from mister wolf. Had I pointed out all the piles of bear scat I believe that she might have had further to think about. We had seen many critters large and small along with sign from the many unseen. Some only heard from as they spoke with each other, it's a shame I didn't have my new hearing aids on this trip. (Ain't much that still works the way it should with me.) <br/>Future trips? Perhaps a day trip in to get the GPS coordinates of where the 'Ranger's Cabin' off Nina Moose use to be, but beyond that I would be kidding myself and be a burden to whoever might be foolish enough to go in with me. 'The mind is willing, but the flesh ain't.' We did record a number of wave points with the GPS on this trip. So if either of the kids or both decide that further trips in are appropriate, they're all set. Or perhaps a whole different area of the boundary waters is where they need to go to start their own list of special places. At least they now have the first trip in for reference. For that matter, any wilderness area can work as long as you do your homework.

THIS STORY IS PART OF A SERIES EXAMINING THE FINALISTS FOR THOSE NAMES.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the western flank of Beacon Hill there is a scraggly plot of land that was once home to Chief Spokane Garry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most recently a camel farm, now it is a vacant parcel. But in the 1860s, it was important. Chief Garry hosted dignitaries there, including Washington Territorial Gov. Isaac Stevens and the Rev. Henry Cowley.</p><p>But then in 1883 or 1884 Spokane Garry was robbed, according to David Beine, a professor of intercultural studies at Great Northern University (most recently the former Moody Bible Institute).</p><p>\"He occupied (that land) for 20 years. Then European Dutchmen came in while he was away fishing and actually occupied it and kicked him off and burned his cabin down,\" Beine said.</p><p>Garry fought to get back his land - east of what is now Havana Street and between East Valley Springs Road and East Longfellow Avenue - but never did. He died in 1892.</p><p>That's a bit of long forgotten history about one of Spokane's namesake locations, Beacon Hill.</p><p>Today, Spokane Public School is considering naming one of its new middle schools \"Beacon Pines\" to reflect and honor the rugged and historic natural landmark. It's a story Beine has methodically researched since 2008. He's found long-lost records in the national archives and tracked down deeds of sale and titles of ownership.</p><p>Now, Beine is writing a book that he hopes to release this fall.</p><p>\"There were a lot of Indians who were getting their land stolen by whites,\" he said.</p><p>Chief Garry's stolen land is just one part of Beacon Hill's story. Beine has talked to Spokane tribal members who remember camping on Beacon Hill, where there are several archaeological sites and artifacts.</p><p>But, as white people filtered, and then flooded, into the region much of that history was obscured. Soon the hill had become an important aviation landmark.</p><p>Early flyers, banking toward Felts Field (known then as Parkwater Aviation Field), scanned the skyline for its distinctive shape, knowing home was close, said Spokane Valley Heritage Museum director Jayne Singleton.</p><p>To this day, when Singleton is scanning through historic photos searching for ones of Felts Field, she looks for Beacon Hill's distinctive rise.</p><p>\"It's such an iconic landmark,\" she said.</p><p>That aviation landmark got an upgrade after a flying tragedy in Wenatchee.</p><p>On April 29, 1928 Maj. John T. Fancher, a Spokane native and World War I pilot, participated in an air show as part of Wenatchee's annual Apple Blossom Festival. During the show, Fancher dropped grenade-like bombs from his cockpit in an aerial bombing demonstration, according to the online history website HistoryLink.</p><p>The bombs were designed to detonate six seconds after the pilot scratched the fuse; however, several failed to explode. After the show ended, and once he was safely back on the ground, Fancher went to examine the unexploded ordinance. One blew up in his face, severely injuring him. He died shortly after.</p><p>Within days, the East Wenatchee airfield was named Fancher Field in his honor, and Spokane citizens raised money to build a rotating light on modern day Beacon Hill. Fancher, who was a member of the Spokane-based Air National Guard unit, had been a proponent of the project prior to his death.</p><p>Later that year, the powerful rotating light was built on the 2,589-foot hill in east Spokane. It was known then as the Fancher Beacon tower and could be seen from a distance of 150 miles.</p><p>It was accompanied by a large lighted arrow fastened to the tower and pointing toward Felts Field.</p><p>Vandalized by gunfire over the years, the light operated until about 1950. The tower stood until 2012, at which point the old 70-foot lattice tower was dismantled to make way for a 120-foot emergency communications tower.</p><p>At that time Singleton tried to acquire the light for the Spokane Valley Heritage Museum but wasn't able to.</p><p>\"I don't know what became of it,\" she said.</p><p>Since its days as a navigational aid, Beacon Hill has become a popular mountain biking and hiking spot.</p><p>But like many beloved Spokane-area recreation spots, many of those trails were on private land. For decades, land owners allowed mountain biking and other public use, although frequent complaints of littering and the occasional forest fire stressed relationships, said Paul Knowles, Spokane County park planner.</p><p>That began to change around 2008 when a local mountain biking group applied for some federal funding to try and buy some of that land. Those efforts culminated in 2020 when the city and county agreed to purchase a combined 40 acres bordering Camp Sekani Park.</p><p>As for Chief Garry's plot of land? It remains vacant.</p><p>\"I'm kind of hopeful that maybe it will be a park,\" said Beine.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-39843134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65CT-X2K1-DYFF-80M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"804\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 25, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009P6R</classCode><className>MOODY BIBLE INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

Photo: AUDIO NETWORK  <br/>The wildfires in Greece have scorched their way through thousands of hectares, leaving three dead, hundreds homeless, causing incalculable damage and capsizing the critical tourism season. <br/><br/>Those staying behind have been without running water and electricity, sometimes for days on end. <br/>The fires have been fanned by the country's worst heatwave in decades and the authorities have pointed the finger at climate change, which experts say increases the intensity and frequency of such extreme weather events. <br/> Satellite image showing smoke plumes from wildfires on the Greek island of Evia, August 9. Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA  <br/>Algeria has meanwhile become the latest Mediterranean country to be hit by devastating wildfires this summer, with the death toll there rising to 65 on Wednesday. <br/> Eight people were killed in blazes in Turkey earlier in the month. <br/>The fire situation in Greece was most precarious on Wednesday in the mountainous and forested Peloponnese region of Gortynia. <br/> With the assistance of a huge multinational force, Greek fire crews were fighting to beat back blazes on the island of Evia and in the Peloponnese peninsula Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Christos Lambropoulos, deputy governor for the broader Arcadia region, said efforts were concentrated on keeping the fire from reaching the area's tallest mountain, Mount Mainalo. <br/>\"We estimate the front is over 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) long,\" he told Skai TV. <br/>\"It's a very thick forest with many communities,\" he said. <br/>Forces in Gortynia were beefed up Wednesday to nearly 600 firefighters including crews from the Czech Republic, Britain, France and Germany. <br/> Tourism has been demolished and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades, officials say Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>Another 60 firemen were tackling a smaller fire in Laconia, in the southeastern Peloponnese, the fire department said. <br/>A huge multinational force of nearly 900 firefighters has meanwhile been deployed to back fire crews on the Greek island of Evia, where the town of Istiaia has been under threat for days. <br/>It included Cypriots, Moldovans, Poles, Serbs, Slovaks, Romanians and Ukrainians. Serbian, Swedish and Swiss planes and helicopters were among a fleet of seven aircraft providing support. <br/> With the assistance of a huge multinational force, Greek fire crews were fighting to beat back blazes on the island of Evia and in the Peloponnese peninsula Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>\"Yesterday, we saw the light of the sun for the first time in days,\" Istiaia mayor Yiannis Kontzias told state TV ERT. <br/>He was referring to giant smoke clouds that have choked residents and obstructed flights by water-bombing aircraft. <br/>EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and more than 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were due to arrive by Friday. <br/> Wildfires in Greece Photo: AFP / Thorsten EBERDING  <br/>Support from abroad has helped avert an even greater disaster. <br/>\"When we arrived, it seemed like the whole of Greece was burning,\" said Nicolas Faure, part of a detachment of more than 170 French firefighters that began arriving late last week. <br/>Even as the immediate danger for his town receded, Kontzias said local businesses \"face extinction\" in coming months in a tourism season already decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic. <br/>\"We have lost the month of August, which would have sustained people here over the coming year.\" <br/>\"(Local) tourism has been demolished, most (visitors) have left,\" the mayor said. <br/>\"The damage is huge, and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades.\" <br/>From July 29 to August 11, more than 93,000 hectares (231,000 acres) were burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 2,330 hectares. <br/>A draft UN assessment seen exclusively by AFP called the Mediterranean a \"climate change hotspot\" and said increasing temperatures and aridity had lengthened fire seasons and \"doubled potential burnable area\". <br/>Dimitris Haliotis, the head of a Red Cross team, said that \"the entire ecosystem is destroyed\" on the island, with the loss of forest animals running in the hundreds. <br/>Theodoros Roumeliotis, the local hoteliers president in the Greek spa town of Aidipsos, said August reservations had collapsed by 90 percent. <br/>\"It's a colossal loss,\" he told AFP. <br/>\"Right now, hotels are obliged to refund one million euros in reservations cancelled,\" he said, adding that some operators were unlikely to survive the blow. <br/>There have been growing calls in Greece for the resignation of top public safety officials who as recently as June had insisted that the country was well-prepared. <br/>There was additional anger over the loss last week of much of the forest of Varibobi, one of Athens' last remaining nature reserves. In that fire, the former royal estate of Tatoi narrowly avoided destruction. <br/>Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias said Greece's resources were \"stronger than ever before\". <br/>\"We faced an operationally unique situation with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather phenomenon in 40 years,\" he said on Tuesday. <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this week apologised to the nation for any possible \"shortcomings\" in the state's response. He is to hold a press conference on Thursday. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162870062604425879100108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BR-96M1-F03R-N455-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><timeReceived>4:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 11, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

It's a touchy subject. I fell in and out of \"like\" multiple times during my walk back from the theater. And yet, after a full 720 degrees of reflection, I still have no one-liner to describe my thoughts. It's wholly disarming; the film seems to have found my blind spot of articulation. So, when someone asks, \"How was Last Night in Soho?\" I run through the following warring thoughts while my face twists into an almost-constipated expression:</p><p>I'm a pretty devoted Edgar Wright fan, meaning I'm facing my own veritable Sophie's Choice on whether or not I should feel disappointed in or forgiving of this interesting but ultimately sloppy thriller. For the unfamiliar, Edgar Wright's bread and butter is comic book levity: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz are honed down to a science and universally loved by nerds everywhere. They're incredibly stylized, fast, and never too far from a joke. Most people will point to the quick camera movements, ostentatious editing, and mastery of pacing as the fundamentals of an Edgar Wright movie, but after seeing Last Night in Soho, I think that's the forest, not the trees. There's a self-aware playfulness that Wright exudes in his previous films, a teasing brag of \"Watch me pull this off!\" followed by a story where the joy lies not in the plot, but in a cinematic environment crafted solely for fun. I now realize that I wasn't excited to see the \"new Edgar Wright thriller\" because I anticipated anything technical or pretentious, but because of my basic human desire to have a good time.\u00a0</p><p>Last Night in Soho feels like you were promised a trip to a new Disneyland park and were taken swiftly to a Home Depot.\u00a0</p><p>The film's saving grace is its powerhouse of acting talent. Thomasin Mackenzie is sublime and steals the show from the very first scene. The only movie I had seen her in previously was Leave No Trace, a beautiful film where her talent lay in microexpressions. However, she steps up to bat with a stunning, comic book character-esque performance in this thriller, flavoring her very conspicuous emotions with unexpected nuance.\u00a0</p><p>Unfortunately, Mackenzie is handed a very binary role-she's either quiet and naive or in shock and completely batshit. Although she gives it her all, her frazzled, mousy expression came to remind me of laughable cartoon characters who refuse to sleep. The bloodshot eyes, the frizzy hair, the pursed lips. Slowly, she became a caricature of the mental illnesses tacked onto her. It felt like an insult to the viewer, as if we wouldn't have been capable of understanding the \"psychological\" in \"psychological thriller\" unless it looked like Dr. Seuss illustrated the DSM. Her performance in the beginning of the film held promise as we felt we were teetering on the precipice of something dark and terrible. But Pandora's box is promptly blown wide open and we're left staring blankly at the anticlimax. What could have been a rich dive into the mind of someone afflicted with a dizzying cocktail of mental disorders is instead flattened into what a bored psychiatrist might scribble onto their notepad. She is left without any deeper reserve of emotion to dig into, and we are robbed of an insidious decline into unreliable narration.</p><p>Anya Taylor Joy's character treatment is far more criminal. As perhaps the world's biggest (at the very least, the most ardent) Anya Taylor Joy fan, I watched this movie for her. That isn't saying much: I would watch garbage being set on fire for three hours if Anya Taylor Joy gave a thumbs up at the end. But I was so incredibly excited to see her play a femme fatale and knock it out of the park. What I instead received was an archetype I'd pay good money to never see again: a villainized damsel in distress. Anya's key asset in the film is her beauty and the innocence of her doe eyes, a deeply upsetting misuse of an actress capable of so much more. Her character arc is a jarring rollercoaster from slow burn to incredibly rapid and horrifying forest fire. Through no fault of her own, we're taken all too literally through the ever-so predictable saga of a woman scorned.</p><p>Therein lies the rub: Last Night in Soho contributes to the already too-large canon of \"what men think women are afraid of.\" It's the classic male-gaze sexual violence film, where beats linger too long on the exploited woman or the fearful young girl, casting the audience as the leering voyeur. Edgar Wright clearly aimed to make a feminist manifesto, a horror about what women see in men, but it's leaden with the excitement of a man ready to catch a tragedy and film it with shaky hands and heavy breathing. The dialogue is awful (the final twist is revealed via a long monologue, leaving nothing to the imagination), and I can't help but think that he didn't get much farther in his pitch than \"What if every man was creepy?\" For women, this movie might as well be watermarked with \"Not For You.\" It pitches up the latent fear of losing control in a man's world and makes it annoying and tinny. It's almost as if Wright can't fathom men making sense of a woman's point of view unless each male character and action is underlined and bolded asgross andevil andup to no good. As a result, most male characters in the film are exaggerated to the point of being unrecognizable to any male viewer, rendering this narrative useless for self-reflection.\u00a0</p><p>Despite how easy it is, it's entirely useless to just tell Edgar Wright \"Boo! Go back to comedies, you hack!\" Morally, the film is a nightmare, but nobody can deny that there's something exciting beneath the film's exterior, possibly even bordering on brilliant. The cinematography, although excessive at times, is masterful. As seen in behind the scenes footage, there is a seamless blend of CGI and practical effects, choreographed with immense precision. The film's impeccable use of light for characterization far exceeded its use of dialogue. Visually, it is one of the most striking films of 2021, with wonderful callbacks to the style of Wright's previous films blended with intriguing explorations into more disorienting imagery. Despite the brutal butchering of a genre, you can still hear an unmistakable whisper of Edgar Wright's distinct voice. I'll admit that when the film finally started to pick up the pace, I felt a familiar smile tug at my lips. Of course, the smile disappeared and reappeared erratically throughout the plot, as if I were signaling in Morse code with my mouth. But, what was good was great. What was bad was... well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5155783</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6442-BRV1-JBSN-32NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1104\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Yale Herald: Yale University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 11, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>New Haven</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001113</classCode><className>MENTAL ILLNESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D1KC</classCode><className>NEW HAVEN, CT, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Two other firefighters were in intensive care with severe burns.</p><p>\"We handled an operationally unique situation, with 586 fires in eight days during the worst weather conditions we've seen in 40 years,\" Hardalias told a news conference. \"Never was there such a combination of adverse factors in the history of the fire service.\"</p><p>Greece had just experienced its worst heat wave since 1987, which left its forests tinder-dry. Other nearby nations such as Turkey and Italy also faced the same searing temperatures and quickly spreading fires.</p><p>Worsening drought and heat, both linked to climate change, have also fueled wildfires this summer in the U.S. West and in Siberia in northern Russia.</p><p>Scientists say there is little doubt that climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is driving extreme events. Researchers can directly link a single event to climate change only through intensive data analysis, but they say such calamities are expected to happen more frequently.</p><p>In Greece, the worst blaze still burning Tuesday was in the northern section of Evia, the country's second-largest island, which is linked by a bridge to the mainland north of Athens and is a favorite holiday destination for the Greek capital's residents.</p><p>Nearly 900 firefighters, 50 ground teams and more than 200 vehicles were fighting the blaze that broke out Aug. 3, the fire service said. They included crews from Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Cyprus and Poland - part of a huge international response to Greece's plea for assistance.</p><p>Fourteen helicopters provided air support Tuesday on Evia, including three from Serbia, two from Switzerland and two from Egypt. The wildfire on Evia, unlike many in the United States, was burning in an area in which villages and forests are entwined.</p><p>Hardalias said all the fire fronts on Evia were waning, but firefighters were guarding the perimeter of the blaze, particularly around a cluster of villages that were among the dozens evacuated on the island in recent days. However, heavy smoke from the fires has often reduced visibility to zero, making it too dangerous for water-dropping aircraft to assist ground forces.</p><p>According to EU wildfire data and satellite imagery, more than 49,000 hectares (121,000 acres) have burned up on Evia - by far the worst damage from any of the recent fires in Greece.</p><p>Several other wildfires were burning in the country, with the most significant in the southern Peloponnese region, where new evacuations were ordered Tuesday afternoon. About 400 firefighters, including teams from the Czech Republic and Britain, battled that blaze, assisted by five helicopters and 23 water-dropping planes from several countries.</p><p>A judicial investigation is under way into the causes of the fires, including any links to criminal activity. Several arson suspects have been arrested.</p><p>\"I don't know whether there is any organized arson plan, that's not my job,\" Hardalias told the news conference. But it was his \"feeling\" that at least with the flames near ancient Olympia, the seven or eight fires that broke out in close succession could be due to arson.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, a woman convicted of intentionally starting a fire in an Athens park last week was sentenced to five years in prison.</p><p>Residents and local officials on Evia have complained about a lack of water-dropping planes in the early stages that they say left the fire to grow to such proportions that flying became too hazardous.</p><p>Hardalias argued that when the Evia blaze broke out, authorities were already facing other enormous challenges. A major forest fire was burning through the northern outskirts of Athens, forcing the evacuation of thousands, and another was coursing through villages towards ancient Olympia - a hugely important archaeological site in the Peloponnese where the ancient Olympic Games were held for more than 1,000 years.</p><p>\"Every house lost is a tragedy for all of us. It's a knife in our heart,\" he said.</p><p>Asked whether he was satisfied with the country's firefighting response, Hardalias said: \"Obviously, there can be no satisfaction after such a catastrophe. But all our available forces, ground and airborne, were sent immediately to the fires.\"</p><p>\"Whether we could have done something different remains to be seen,\" he said. \"But in any case, we fought a great battle, and the losses were among those fighting it, not among civilians.\"</p><p>Greek authorities have emphasized saving lives, issuing evacuation alerts for dozens of villages and neighborhoods this summer. In 2018, a deadly fire that engulfed a seaside settlement near Athens killed more than 100 people, including some who drowned trying to escape the flames and smoke by sea.</p><p>Critics say the government's focus on evacuating villages prevented villagers with local knowledge from helping firefighters and led to more property destruction.</p><p>Greece's center-right government has pledged to provide compensation to everyone who suffered loss from the wildfires and to undertake a massive reforestation effort to replace the trees that have burned.</p><p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told a special cabinet meeting Tuesday that owners of destroyed or damaged homes would receive up to 150,000 euros ($176,000) in state compensation, with initial payments to begin next week, while businesses and farmers will also get support and tax breaks.</p><p>In southwest Turkey, crews battled two fires Tuesday in the coastal province of Mugla, including a brush fire near Bodrum's Gumusluk resort neighborhood. Bodrum's mayor said the fire was close to being extinguished and no residential areas were threatened.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters quickly put out a new blaze in a forest in Istanbul's Sariyer district.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4716139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BV-BGW1-DYWP-80KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Woodward Communications, Inc.

To put that elevation into perspective, Denver - the mile-high city - sits at 5,280 feet, and Aspen, Colorado, is at 8,000 feet. These high-elevation areas are largely remote mountains and forests with some small communities and ski areas.</p><p>The area burning above 8,200 feet more than tripled in 2001-2017 compared with 1984-2000. </p><p>Our results show that climate warming has diminished the high-elevation flammability barrier - the point where forests historically were too wet to burn regularly because the snow normally lingered well into summer and started falling again early in the fall. Fires advanced about 826 feet (252 meters) uphill in the Western mountains over those three decades.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6964/\">Cameron Peak Fire in Colorado</url> in 2020 was the largest fire in the state's history, burning over 208,000 acres (84,175 hectares), and is a prime example of a high-elevation forest fire. The fire burned in forests extending to 12,000 feet (3,658 meters) and reached the upper tree line of the Rocky Mountains.  </p><p>We found that rising temperatures in the past 34 years have helped to extend the fire territory in the West to an additional 31,470 square miles (81,507 square kilometers) of high-elevation forests. That means a staggering 11% of all Western U.S. forests - an area similar in size to South Carolina - are susceptible to fire now that weren't three decades ago. </p><h>Can't blame fire suppression here</h><p>In lower-elevation forests, several factors contribute to fire activity, including the presence of more people in wildland areas and a history of fire suppression. </p><p>In the early 1900s, Congress commissioned the U.S. Forest Service to <url normalizedValue=\"https://foresthistory.org/research-explore/us-forest-service-history/policy-and-law/fire-u-s-forest-service/u-s-forest-service-fire-suppression/\">manage forest fires</url>, which resulted in a focus on suppressing fires - a policy that continued through the 1970s. This caused flammable underbrush that would normally be cleared out by occasional natural blazes to accumulate. The increase in biomass in many lower elevation forests across the West has been associated with increases in <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00217.1\">high-severity fires and megafires</url>. At the same time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607171113\">climate warming has dried out forests in the Western U.S.</url>, making them more prone to large fires. </p><p>By focusing on high-elevation fires in areas with little history of fire suppression, we can more clearly see the influence of climate change. </p><p>Most high-elevation forests haven't been subjected to much fire suppression, logging or other human activities, and because trees at these high elevations are in wetter forests, they historically have long <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/fire_regime_table/PNVG_fire_regime_table.html\">return intervals between fires</url>, typically a century or more. Yet they experienced the highest rate of increase in fire activity in the past 34 years. We found that the increase is strongly correlated with the observed warming.</p><h>High mountain fires create new problems</h><p>High-elevation fires have implications for natural and human systems. </p><p>High mountains are natural water towers that normally provide a sustained source of water to millions of people during dry summer months in the Western U.S. The scars that wildfires leave behind - known as burn scars - affect how much snow can accumulate at high elevations. This can influence the timing, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/es500130g\">quality and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr042_4.pdf\">quantity of water</url> that reaches reservoirs and rivers downstream.</p><p>High-elevation fires also remove standing trees that act as anchor points that normally stabilize the snowpack, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.050\">raising the risk of avalanches</url>.</p><p>The loss of tree canopy also exposes mountain streams to the Sun, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/09-0822.1\">increasing water temperatures</url> in the cold headwater streams. Increasing stream temperatures can harm fish and the larger wildlife and predators that rely on them. </p><p>Climate change is increasing fire risk in many regions across the globe, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1003669107\">studies show that this trend will continue</url> as the planet warms. The increase in fires in the high mountains is another warning to the U.S. West and elsewhere of the risks ahead as the climate changes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an update to a story published May 24, 2021.</emphasis></p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Understand new developments in science, health and technology, each week.</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/us/newsletters/science-editors-picks-71/?utm_source=TCUS&amp;utm_medium=inline-link&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter-text&amp;utm_content=science-understand\">Subscribe to The Conversation's science newsletter</url>.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mojtaba Sadegh receives funding from the US National Science Foundation and the Joint Fire Science Program.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Abatzoglou receives funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mohammad Reza Alizadeh does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUSA-167706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUSA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63KS-9HS1-JB75-91YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><timeReceived>12:14 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United States</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6137\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 13, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

More than 21 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States - arate approaching one in 15 people - plus untold millions who had mild or no symptoms and were never identified. Add the millions who have received their first doses of vaccine, and it is fair to wonder:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Can we start to look forward to when life returns to normal?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer hinges on that often-misunderstood concept of herd immunity, made all the more complicated by the emergence of two variants of the coronavirus that seem to spread more rapidly, one of which is already in the United States. Evidence sofar suggests that the new mutations will have little, if any, impact on how well the vaccines work, and they do not seem to result in a more severe illness.</p><p>Yet given the wintertime surge in cases - possibly aggravated by the new mutations - and the question of how long immunity lasts, public health experts say this is no time to relax precautions.</p><p>For a reality check on how far we've come, we spoke to three researchers who study the spread of infectious disease: Temple University epidemiologist Abby Rudolph, Drew University biologist Brianne Barker, and Penn State University biologist Maciej Boni.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Like a forest fire</emphasis></p><p>The term <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">herd immunity</emphasis> was coined a century ago by veterinarians studying the spread of disease in livestock. Simply put, they meant that if enough cows developed immunity to an illness, the herd would be protected. Even if an animal or two were somehow to become infected on occasion, they would be unable to pass it on.</p><p>Boni, who has served on World Health Organization committees for malaria and other disease epidemics, likens the concept to a forest fire.</p><p>\"If a lot of the trees have been burned down,\" he said, \"you have a forest that's sparse enough that no fire can take off in the forest.\"</p><p>But in practice, achieving the threshold necessary for mass protection from disease is complicated. For one thing, the number varies depending on how easily the microbe in question spreads.</p><p>Measles, to borrow the forest analogy, spreads like proverbial wildfire - with each infected person passing it on to more than a dozen others in an unexposed population. It is so infectious that more than 90% of a population must be immune in order to prevent outbreaks, whether as the result of natural infection or a vaccine. And even then, the level of protection is not uniform. Vaccines are not foolproof, and some people choose not to get them. If a school or neighborhood is home to enough people in that category, there is fuel for apotential outbreak.</p><p>COVID-19 is far less transmissible. In a \"naive\" population with no prior exposure and no precautions in place, each infected person spreads the virus to an average of three others, epidemiologists calculated early in the pandemic. Social distancing, masks, and other safeguards can drive that number down so long as everyone is on board, but a key point to remember is that word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">average</emphasis>. Some people with COVID-19 are super-spreaders - passing on the disease to far more than three others, whether because they are careless, or unaware they're infected, or both.</p><p>Taking those uncertainties into account, scientists estimated that 60% to 70% of people needed to be immune before the virus could be contained.</p><p>Then in December, anew wrinkle emerged: a variant of the coronavirus that seemed to spread more rapidly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The British variant</emphasis></p><p>Viruses mutate a tiny bit every time they copy themselves in order to spread from cell to cell. In the vast majority of cases, these random changes have no effect on how well a microbe spreads. Or they have anegative effect, causing aparticular lineage to die out.</p><p>When a new variant started to spread rapidly in Britain, researchers said it could be the result of something called a founder effect - meaning that version of the virus gained traction simply because it happened to be the one carried by a person who exposed lots of other people, not because of some change in the virus itself.</p><p>But mounting evidence suggests that mutations in the virus, not human behavior, are somehow enabling the faster spread, said Drew University's Barker, who studies the biology of the immune system.</p><p>A key indicator is that every time the variant arrives in a new location, it seems to spread just as rapidly as it has in the United Kingdom, Barker said.</p><p>\"The odds would be against having it be a founder effect or some behavioral issue in each new country, where we know the restrictions and the behaviors are so different,\" she said.</p><p>Pennsylvania health officials said Thursday that the new variant, dubbed B.1.1.7, had been identified in aDauphin County resident who apparently became infected while abroad. Meanwhile, another fast-spreading variant has been identified in South Africa.</p><p>It remains unclear just how much faster these new strains can spread, or exactly which genetic changes are to blame, Barker said. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that the threshold for herd immunity from COVID may now be above 80%.</p><p>If there's any good news, neither set of mutations in the new variants is thought to be significant enough that the vaccines will no longer work. And neither version of the virus seems to make people more sick.</p><p>But the health consequences of COVID-19 were bad enough to begin with. If the same fraction of infected people become seriously ill, then an increase in overall infections means more people end up in hospitals, and more people die.</p><p>\"All this means to me,\" Barker said, \"is that we have a lot less room for error in all of the interventions that we're doing.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So how close are we?</emphasis></p><p>One challenge in measuring the spread of the coronavirus is the fact that many people have mild symptoms or none at all, and never undergo the nasal-swab tests that detect a current infection. Scientists have tried to get past that roadblock with adifferent test: measuring blood samples for the presence of antibodies, which can remain in the blood for months after an infection.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has undertaken several such studies, including one in Pennsylvania, testing samples from people who get their blood drawn for various reasons at commercial labs.</p><p>This month, scientists at the drug companies Pfizer and Merck analyzed these studies and others to conclude that, as of mid-November, 47 million Americans - 14% of the population - had antibodies to the virus. That finding, published in JAMA Network Open, represents more than four times the official case count of 11 million by that point.</p><p>But the analysis has limitations, said Rudolph, an associate professor of epidemiology at Temple's College of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>Among other issues, the people whose antibody levels were measured might not be representative of the general population in some way. They might have gotten their blood drawn because of an underlying health issue that made them more susceptible to infection. Or maybe they were more liable to take precautions, meaning they could be less likely to have been infected with the virus, Rudolph said.</p><p>\"The biases can go in either way,\" she said.</p><p>The study authors acknowledged these limitations and others, and said their 14% figure represented an estimate, ranging from below 12% to above 18%.</p><p>Boni, the Penn State biologist, said 14% was at least in the ballpark. And since then, cases have surged.</p><p>If the rate of undetected cases remains several times higher than the official case count, that could mean the United States is approaching 60 million or 70 million infections - perhaps 20% of the population, though it varies from state to state.</p><p>Pennsylvania is likely close to that level of infection, and with a continued post-holiday surge, seems poised to hit 28% by the end of January, said Boni, who has analyzed state data.</p><p>A grim forecast, for sure. But at the same time, the rate of vaccinations is picking up, contributing to herd immunity in asafe fashion.</p><p>A good target would be to vaccinate 10% of the population each month, he said. That would mean 38% protection (28% plus 10%) by the end of January, and maybe more than 50% immunity by the end of February.</p><p>\"Now March looks good,\" he said. \"And if March looks good, April looks really good,\" with some aspects of life starting to seem \"close to normal.\"</p><p>That's if all goes well. But the vaccines are not 100% effective. And it is unclear how long immunity lasts, though arecent study led by the La Jolla Institute for Immunology found that after infection, various defenses in the immune system retained their \"memory\" of the virus for up to eight months.</p><p>It is, in effect, a race against time, Boni said. The more illness we wish to prevent, the faster we should make sure every pharmacy and clinic is supplied with syringes.</p><p>\"We have to keep vaccinating,\" he said. \"We don't have any alternative.\"</p><p>+<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tavril@inquirer.com\">tavril@inquirer.com</email></p><p>^215-854-2430 \"TomAvril1</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-PHDN20210112Ar00302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61RP-1WF1-JC3R-B4F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 12, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>TEMPLE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>PENN STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002059</classCode><className>DISEASE REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Even if an animal or two were somehow to become infected on occasion, they would be unable to pass it on.</p><p>Boni, who has served on World Health Organization committees for malaria and other disease epidemics, likens the concept to a forest fire.</p><p>\"If a lot of the trees have been burned down,\" he said, \"you have a forest that's sparse enough that no fire can take off in the forest.\"</p><p>But in practice, achieving the threshold necessary for mass protection from disease is complicated. For one thing, the number varies depending on how easily the microbe in question spreads.</p><p>Measles, to borrow the forest analogy, spreads like proverbial wildfire - with each infected person passing it on to more than a dozen others in an unexposed population. It is so infectious that more than 90% of a population must be immune in order to prevent outbreaks, whether as the result of natural infection or a vaccine. And even then, the level of protection is not uniform. Vaccines are not foolproof, and some people choose not to get them. If a school or neighborhood is home to enough people in that category, there is fuel for a potential outbreak.</p><p>COVID-19 is far less transmissible. In a \"naive\" population with no prior exposure and no precautions in place, each infected person spreads the virus to an average of three others, epidemiologists calculated early in the pandemic. Social distancing, masks, and other safeguards can drive that number down so long as everyone is on board, but a key point to remember is that word <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">average</emphasis>. Some people with COVID-19 are super-spreaders - passing on the disease to far more than three others, whether because they are careless, or unaware they're infected, or both.</p><p>Taking those uncertainties into account, scientists estimated that 60% to 70% of people needed to be immune before the virus could be contained.</p><p>Then in December, a new wrinkle emerged: a variant of the coronavirus that seemed to spread more rapidly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The British variant</emphasis></p><p>Viruses mutate a tiny bit every time they copy themselves in order to spread from cell to cell. In the vast majority of cases, these random changes have no effect on how well a microbe spreads. Or they have a negative effect, causing a particular lineage to die out.</p><p>When a new variant started to spread rapidly in Britain, researchers said it could be the result of something called a founder effect - meaning that version of the virus gained traction simply because it happened to be the one carried by a person who exposed lots of other people, not because of some change in the virus itself.</p><p>But mounting evidence suggests that mutations in the virus, not human behavior, are somehow enabling the faster spread, said Drew University's Barker, who studies the biology of the immune system.</p><p>A key indicator is that every time the variant arrives in a new location, it seems to spread just as rapidly as it has in the United Kingdom, Barker said.</p><p>\"The odds would be against having it be a founder effect or some behavioral issue in each new country, where we know the restrictions and the behaviors are so different,\" she said.</p><p>Pennsylvania health officials said Thursday that the new variant, dubbed B.1.1.7, had been identified in a Dauphin County resident who apparently became infected while abroad. Meanwhile, another fast-spreading variant has been identified in South Africa.</p><p>It remains unclear just how much faster these new strains can spread, or exactly which genetic changes are to blame, Barker said. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that the threshold for herd immunity from COVID may now be above 80%.</p><p>If there's any good news, neither set of mutations in the new variants is thought to be significant enough that the vaccines will no longer work. And neither version of the virus seems to make people more sick.</p><p>But the health consequences of COVID-19 were bad enough to begin with. If the same fraction of infected people become seriously ill, then an increase in overall infections means more people end up in hospitals, and more people die.</p><p>\"All this means to me,\" Barker said, \"is that we have a lot less room for error in all of the interventions that we're doing.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So how close are we?</emphasis></p><p>One challenge in measuring the spread of the coronavirus is the fact that many people have mild symptoms or none at all, and never undergo the nasal-swab tests that detect a current infection. Scientists have tried to get past that roadblock with a different test: measuring blood samples for the presence of antibodies, which can remain in the blood for months after an infection.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has undertaken several such studies, including one in Pennsylvania, testing samples from people who get their blood drawn for various reasons at commercial labs.</p><p>This month, scientists at the drug companies Pfizer and Merck analyzed these studies and others to conclude that, as of mid-November, 47 million Americans - 14% of the population - had antibodies to the virus. That finding, published in JAMA Network Open, represents more than four times the official case count of 11 million by that point.</p><p>But the analysis has limitations, said Rudolph, an associate professor of epidemiology at Temple's College of Public Health, who was not involved in the study.</p><p>Among other issues, the people whose antibody levels were measured might not be representative of the general population in some way. They might have gotten their blood drawn because of an underlying health issue that made them more susceptible to infection. Or maybe they were more liable to take precautions, meaning they could be less likely to have been infected with the virus, Rudolph said.</p><p>\"The biases can go in either way,\" she said.</p><p>The study authors acknowledged these limitations and others, and said their 14% figure represented an estimate, ranging from below 12% to above 18%.</p><p>Boni, the Penn State biologist, said 14% was at least in the ballpark. And since then, cases have surged.</p><p>If the rate of undetected cases remains several times higher than the official case count, that could mean the United States is approaching 60 million or 70 million infections - perhaps 20% of the population, though it varies from state to state.</p><p>Pennsylvania is likely close to that level of infection, and with a continued post-holiday surge, seems poised to hit 28% by the end of January, said Boni, who has analyzed state data.</p><p>A grim forecast, for sure. But at the same time, the rate of vaccinations is picking up, contributing to herd immunity in a safe fashion.</p><p>A good target would be to vaccinate 10% of the population each month, he said. That would mean 38% protection (28% plus 10%) by the end of January, and maybe more than 50% immunity by the end of February.</p><p>\"Now March looks good,\" he said. \"And if March looks good, April looks really good,\" with some aspects of life starting to seem \"close to normal.\"</p><p>That's if all goes well. But the vaccines are not 100% effective. And it is unclear how long immunity lasts, though a recent study led by the La Jolla Institute for Immunology found that after infection, various defenses in the immune system retained their \"memory\" of the virus for up to eight months.</p><p>It is, in effect, a race against time, Boni said. The more illness we wish to prevent, the faster we should make sure every pharmacy and clinic is supplied with syringes.</p><p>\"We have to keep vaccinating,\" he said. \"We don't have any alternative.\" <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tavril@inquirer.com\">tavril@inquirer.com</email></p><p>215-854-2430 TomAvril1</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHIDLY-PHQP20210112Ar00102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHIDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61RP-1WF1-JC3R-B4G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 12, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>TEMPLE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>PENN STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DP57</classCode><className>DISEASE IMMUNITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002233</classCode><className>EPIDEMIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002059</classCode><className>DISEASE REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

The situation is complicated by the proximity of the line of delimitation of forces and assets.</p><p>\"The President has approved a decision to use aviation. We set a task to completely localize all sources of fire by the end of the day, so that even if the wind rises again, we do not have any risks,\" the Interior Minister said.</p><p>He also stressed the need to send additional equipment to the region for rapid response.</p><p>Mykola Chechotkin, Head of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, said that 113 units of equipment, more than 500 rescuers, as well as police, National Guard and military engineering units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are currently eliminating the emergency situation in the region.</p><p>According to him, yesterday all the necessary forces and means of the Luhansk garrison were sent to extinguish the forest fire, but due to the strong wind the fire began to spread chaotically, in unpredictable directions, and spread to the settlement. Therefore, the SES additionally attracted equipment from other regions.</p><p>\"Today there is no threat to settlements. Fire aircraft is working. I think we will cope with our tasks in the near future,\" Mykola Chechotkin said.</p><p>As the representative of the State Emergency Service reported to the President, aviation works where it is impossible to attract ground equipment. As of now, as a result of the emergency, five people have died, 59 houses have burned down, 24 of them in full and 35 partially.</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the village of Smolyanynove, which was badly damaged by the fire, and talked to local residents. People told the President how they escaped the fire and about the damaged property.</p><p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the need to allocate funds to provide housing for citizens who have lost their homes. At the same time, the President noted that the victims should receive temporary housing as soon as possible.</p><p>\"Temporary housing can be rented very quickly here. If there are not enough relatives or the desire of someone to host these people, it is possible to do it in the region - in boarding houses. I also know that the Kharkiv region offered to accommodate everyone yesterday - they have such opportunities,\" the President said.</p><p>Also, according to him, it is necessary to calculate all the damage caused by the fire to the property, in addition to the loss of housing, because the victims were sometimes left without a farm, documents, money and valuables.</p><p>\"We need to calculate very quickly and provide compensation to people, \"the President said.</p><p>The President commissioned Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Haidai to gather all the necessary information about the victims in order to help them quickly.</p><p>The Head of State emphasized that the lists of victims and damaged property must be submitted today.</p><p>Luhansk RSA Head informed that the lists are being prepared, and the appeal to the government for the allocation of compensations was submitted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123806765</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609M-HSM1-DYTH-G0KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>N624221MC</classCode><className>TEMPORARY SHELTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N531110MM</classCode><className>RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N721300CC</classCode><className>ROOMING &amp; BOARDING HOUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000DO7M</classCode><className>VOLODYMR ZELENSKY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DSHU</classCode><className>LUHANSK, UKRAINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX335</classCode><className>KIYEV, UKRAINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC581</classCode><className>UKRAINE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

OK, OK, it's just a little dusting where we are but we're extremely excited all the same. And our news flow filled with snow this hour too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">S is the stocks, Wall Street beginning the week on a firmer footing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen telling CNN that it's \"so far so good in the fight against inflation\". And it's for Nigeria, Africa's largest economy still counting the votes and its consequential presidential election. We're live in Lagos with the latest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">O is ousted! Canada, just the latest government to announce a TikTok app ban on government phones the United States laying down the law again as well. We'll have a complete report and China's response too. And finally W for wealth, Monday's 5 percent rally in Tesla shares restores Elon Musk is the richest person on the planet maybe even the universe will go that far.</p><p>Tesla stock has bounced almost 100 percent from its recent lows, context, though, is key. And it may sound good but it's still down some 50 percent from all-time highs, as you can see on that chart. Musk getting richer though must be in a most positive market picture and it does U.S. futures rising to end the month though barely.</p><p>Europe also mostly higher too but there is discouraging news on the U.S. consumer spending a key driver of the American economy retailer target topping profit estimates but also warning at the same time that consumers are focusing more on buying necessities. It says the retail environment is \"very challenging\".</p><p>This comes after similar comments from Walmart and Home Depot last week. Tough news on the consumer front in Europe today too, with inflation heating up once again. In France and Spain goods and services the driver there a mixed picture. In the meantime, took over and across the Asian markets as investors close out the trading month Hong Kong announcing though.</p><p>It's finally scrapping its almost three year masks mandate all the details on that coming up, too. But first, we begin with the latest from the war in Ukraine and President Zelenskyy says the fighting in the Eastern City of Bakhmut this \"getting more and more challenging\".</p><p>According to the Ukrainian military, Russia's Wagner mercenary group is sending its most highly trained units to fight there. In the meantime, in Kyiv a surprise visit by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p><p>Melissa Bell joins us on this three imposing I think the financial and moral support that we saw from President Biden, this time last week, too. I know you had the chance to speak to the Treasury Secretary, talk to us about that and of course, the latest from the East as well.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The very latest from the east, first of all, and we've been getting some fairly harrowing accounts, Julia, from some of the soldiers who are leading that battle. You mentioned a moment ago those words from President Zelenskyy last night, the latest from the Officials on the ground.</p><p>One soldier telling CNN look, take those official accounts and imagine a level of difficulty that is 100 percent higher than that. Other another soldier describing the scenes there's hellish. And on some of the videos that we were able to dedicate yesterday, you could really see the effect of the weather that you can see behind me Julia, muddy terrain, some parts of it flooded.</p><p>Now the soldiers are also speaking about the fact that they're holding firm because they say those elite soldiers are being sent some of the most battle ready battle hardened groups and they believe the soldiers that as long as they can hold it. They're gaining time for what Ukraine has promised will be a spring of counter offensive to come but fairly difficult details to read from.</p><p>They say, though, that they are holding the town refuting Russian claims that they've managed to encircle it entirely in saying that, on the contrary, are there a couple of supply routes that remain open even though they are under enemy fire, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes and as we can see there, and we're showing you what appears to be drone pictures of just utter devastation. Melissa, talk to us then about to the U.S. Treasury Secretary because you did manage to speak to her?</p><p>BELL: Well, it was a visit that was designed to show once again, Julia the unwavering American support for Kyiv just a few days after Ukraine celebrated the fact that the city still stood.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BELL (voice over): The objects have been the message from the President himself to the Secretary of State and now to the Treasury Secretary.</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>BELL (voice over): Unwavering American support delivered in person to Kyiv. From a divided and testy G20 in Bangalore, where she chastised the Russian delegation, Janet Yellen came to see for herself. The impact so far, of about $50 billion of American aid to Ukraine.</p><p>BELL (on camera): The comments you made to the Russian Officials in India. Do you want to send some Moscow's listening?</p><p>JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I think they are listening. I think that we have imposed very serious cause on them. And they hear from not only the United States, but a large coalition.</p><p>BELL (voice over): On the Treasury Secretary's tour, an invincibility point where warmth and power are provided, when neither is available. Here Ukrainians shelter, even as allies try to punish Moscow.</p><p>YELLEN: We will not tolerate systematic violations by any country of the sanctions that we've put in place that are intended to deprive Russia of access to military equipment to wage this war. And we've been very clear with the Chinese government, that the consequences of violating those sanctions would be very severe.</p><p>BELL (on camera): I'd like to move on to more domestic matters, if I may. We've seen the fight against inflation take a hit PCE hitting 5.4 percent. Do you believe at this stage that the Fed is behind the curve or that a soft landing is still the most likely scenario?</p><p>YELLEN: I personally believe that it's possible to bring inflation down, while maintaining we have a very strong labor market. I think we can maintain it. I would say so far so good.</p><p>BELL (voice over): But back home, the cost of the war in Ukraine, including its inflationary pressures, was more contentious. As the war enters its second year and with an American election year beginning to loom, there are questions about how long the West's unwavering support can last?</p><p>YELLEN: So I think there is broad support among our allies, many members of Congress have been to Kyiv to visit and I think all of us are inspired by that. And we'll be ready to support it for as long as it takes.</p><p>BELL (voice over): So for now, a further pledge of the support that's allowed Ukraine to come this far.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BELL: What was most remarkable, Julia was seeing Secretary Yellen's emotion and I think that's the case for all of the American leaders in Congress, people who've made the visit here, it is one thing to follow it, it is another thing to fund it. It is something still different to see it for yourself, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely, an important conversation. Melissa, thank you for that! OK, to Russia now President Putin speaking at an annual meeting with the country's security service known as the FSB.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA: Unfortunately, there are losses in our ranks; the leadership of the FSB must do everything to provide additional support to the families of our fallen comrades.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Moscow. Fred, another morale building speech, acknowledging the vital importance, I think of the security services, and that they will need to step up their activities, but also acknowledging and unavoidably the loss on the battlefield too.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right too, Julia, that this was very much a morale building speech for the security services. And it's, sort of a pattern that we've seen from Vladimir Putin over the last couple of days in fact, yesterday, he was giving a speech to Russia's Special Operations Forces.</p><p>And were they're telling them that they were doing a very important job that they needed to continue to do it and then obviously, talking about the special military operation of the war in Ukraine that obviously Russia is involved in. Now, today, he's telling the FSB operatives, exactly the same thing, saying it's very important, the work that they're doing.</p><p>And I think some of the things that we picked up on were extremely interesting, where he acknowledged that they were active on the front lines in the war in Ukraine, but that he also talked about them being active behind enemy lines as well, obviously, trying to infiltrate the territory that's controlled by the Ukrainian forces.</p><p>So that certainly seems like an important acknowledgement. Also, the fact that he did say there and you guys had that in the sound bite, which is very important as well. That there have been losses so far in the ranks of the FSB, as they call it, special military operation goes on.</p><p>I think for Vladimir Putin, it's absolutely clear that these special services and the military as well are extremely important to how things go forward in the war in Ukraine that now of course is in its second year, and we're still progress is pretty slow to come by for the Russian forces.</p><p>[09:10:00]</p><p>PLEITGEN: He said it was very important also for them to get established and establish more of the FSB in those areas that are now controlled by the Russians inside Ukraine. Obviously the Russians view that as their own territory, Vladimir Putin talking about that that was important as well.</p><p>And I do also think that segment where he talked about the possible infiltration, not just by Ukrainian operatives, but by Western intelligence services as well, and that the FSB needed to step up its game there. I think that does show just how serious Vladimir Putin is about all this.</p><p>And of course, that was something that the Kremlin spokesman had said before Vladimir Putin even started talking, that this was going to be a serious conversation that he was going to pave the way for the way things move forward with the FSB in this coming year, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes and the underscores a conversation that we've been having really since this war began that there's two battles going on here. There's the kinetic and the physical war, and there's also the informational war that's taking place as well and very much tied to that the airspace around the main airport in St. Petersburg closed temporarily earlier today.</p><p>Immediately rumors were flying about potential hack attack. What are the Authorities saying, if anything about what happened, Fred?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Yes, that was quite interesting, because originally, they were speaking about an unidentified flying object in the skies around St. Petersburg, around Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg, really a pretty wide area around that airport. The airspace was closed off no flights for a very long period of time.</p><p>Later, the Authorities were saying that there was some sort of hack by of radio and TV station around that area that then broadcast the message that there had been air raid alerts going on there. They later said that, that was fake. And obviously all of this was lifted and now at the airport, the traffic there is moving pretty normally, once again.</p><p>We did hear from Aeroflot from the main carrier here in Russia that they were doing things to make sure that they tried to get their schedule back on track, because obviously a lot of flights were canceled this morning. But it certainly was an interesting sort of segment, you're absolutely right.</p><p>Of course it does tie in possibly to the information war as well, where of course the Russians are now saying that this is a fake message that was broadcast and apparently some of those air raid alerts that could be heard there are very similar to the ones that obviously Ukrainians go through so often right now as they are under attack, especially the critical infrastructure in Ukraine from Russian missiles.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Fred, great to have you there to be able to separate fact from fiction for us. Fred Pleitgen, great to have you, thank you. Now the wait in Nigeria continues three days after voting began 23 out of 36 States have declared their tallies in the race to be the next President.</p><p>The ruling party candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu is leading so far. But of course, frustration and anger are growing and now three opposition parties are calling for a fresh election and the resignation of the Electoral Commission Chairman. Larry Madowo joins us live from Lagos.</p><p>So growing consensus among the opposition parties, but this whole process and we're talking millions and millions of people have to go back to the polls. What is the Electoral Commission saying?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So far, the Electoral Commission has rejected any calls for a redo of this election, but these calls are growing. We've been trying to figure out this past couple of days how much of the irregularities and the places where the polls did not take place, and the violence and the voter intimidation?</p><p>How much of it rose to the level of invalidating the entire election? At least these three main opposition parties in Nigeria think that they were so widespread that it invalidated the entire election. They're calling for a new election, which is unlikely I got to say this, especially because the ruling party candidates the APC, they all people All Progressives Congress Bola Tinubu.</p><p>His party says they're on their way to victory. They're already 1.5 million votes ahead with 13 or so States announced and they will take this thing. I want to read for you a section of the statement from these three main opposition parties in Nigeria.</p><p>Well, they just said today, they say, for instance, that the People's Democratic Party, the Labour Party, the ADC and other line parties shall not be part of the process currently going on at the National Collation Center, and we demand that this sham of an election should be immediately canceled.</p><p>They go on to say that we're also calling for a fresh election to be carried out within the window allowed by the Electoral Act and in accordance with the laid down INEC procedure for the conduct of the 2023 elections. INEC is the Independent National Electoral Commission, and they're calling for the Chairman of the Electoral Commission to step aside if this new election were to take place and somebody from outside the commission to take the reins of carrying out that fresh election.</p><p>This throws a spanner in the works and we will definitely hear some strong reaction from Bola Tinubu's party, he is the ruling party candidates, he's been a Kingmaker. In fact, his entire premise his motive for this election has been it's my time because he's been a Kingmaker in lots of other ways for lots of other Presidents, including President Muhammadu Buhari, and he's believed that it was time for him. So I don't think you'll be accepting this, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and that context is vitally important with what around half of the votes counted down the fact that he's in the lead. You would expect him to say hey, let's just wait for the result here versus the opposition parties, perhaps calling for fresh elections.</p><p>[09:15:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And what are critical here is the people and what they decide and a willing to accept. Larry, what's your sense of whoever they support? What the people are saying and feeling at this moment? And will we ultimately get a result will they accept it whatever it is?</p><p>MADOWO: Because these opposition parties have done a joint statement that means that it covers a lot more of the population. Peter Obi of the Labor Party got a lot of young people excited in this election got to record numbers of them to register to vote. And I've spoken to Nigerians who felt disenfranchised by places where politics didn't take place, or where they were intimidated where those violence, were ballad materials were destroyed?</p><p>And they also felt that this did not represent the views. So the fact that the opposition parties are speaking in a combined voice that adds to the fuel. And I think I've been saying this a past couple of days in our air that there's a growing number of Nigerians who feel that if this outcome does not represent their views, then we might have a problematic situation here.</p><p>This could escalate quickly and this will again add to that file. People will feel so unhappy that they somehow feel that the Electoral Commission colluded the ruling party to disenfranchise them essentially to suppress the votes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, they need to count quicker. Larry Madowo, thank you for that. OK to Asia now and a case of unmasking the masks more than 2.5 years and almost 1000 days later. People in Hong Kong will no longer face hefty fines for violating face covering mandates Kristie Lu Stout reports on Hong Kong's about face.</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the last places on the planet where you still have to wear a mask but after almost three years of both indoor and outdoor use in public, Hong Kong is finally dropping its mask mandate. Now I still have to wear this today, because the mandate is not fully scrapped until Wednesday, March the first. Hong Kong's top leader John Lee made the announcement on Tuesday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN LEE, HONG KONG CHIEF EXECUTIVE: In order to give people a very clear message that Hong Kong is resuming normalcy. I think this is the right time to make this decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: For much of the past three years, Hong Kong and neighboring Macau both followed China's strict zero COVID policy. Macau dropped its mask restrictions on Monday. And according to Dr. Karen Grepen at the University of Hong Kong, face masks have played an important role in reducing community transmission in Hong Kong but now that almost everyone is vaccinated and most people have also been infected, dropping the legal mandate is well past due.</p><p>People can now do their own risk assessment to determine if they want to wear one or not. Hong Kong's move to scrap masks comes after the government launched its Hello Hong Kong campaign to bring back tourists and international visitors and business people. And starting Wednesday, they can breathe easy with the mask mandate effectively over Kristie Lu Stout CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nice to see her smile. Straight ahead recession on the radar or more of a no landing, we'll discuss the economic outlook with Moody's Chief Economist after the break, and later attacking food waste by taking out the trash. I'll chat with the CEO of the startup turning your rubbish into something for more useful. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:20:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\", so far so good on the fight to bring down inflation. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that even though inflation in America is still too high, she believes a soft landing is on the radar but risks, of course still remain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YELLEN: The global situation we face is very uncertain; there can be shocks from it. But look, inflation still is too high but generally, if you look over the last year, inflation has been coming down. And I know the Fed is committed to continuing the process of bringing it down to more normal levels.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Inflation has been falling but not at the pace many economists had hoped for. And recent economic data has put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in order to team rising prices. Joining us now to discuss this and more Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark, always great to have you on the show! Do you agree with that assessment, so far, so good? I guess the emphasis has to be on so far.</p><p>MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes, you know, Julia, I do. I think we're making progress. I mean, as the Secretary pointed out, inflation is still painfully high. But it's definitely moving in the right direction. And all the trend lines look pretty good. So yes, I expect inflation to get back in the bottle close to the Feds target, a year, and year and a half from now and things feel on track.</p><p>You know, obviously, in a world of high inflation and high interest rates in the course of - trying to figure this all out on the fly, you know, recession risks are high. But I think we have a fighting chance to get through this without any recession. So yes, I would agree with the Secretary.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Significant part of the cushioning effect that we've seen is the activity of consumers and what $2 trillion cash cushion that consumers built up during the pandemic? Where that is cushion today and if it's so plump, still? Why is household debt at record highs?</p><p>ZANDI: Well, yes, there's still a lot of cash, consumers have been drawing down that extra savings they did during the pandemic, you know, a lot of people were sheltering in place and couldn't spend. So they save that money. And then, of course, a lot of lower middle income households received government support, and they save that money.</p><p>And that has really helped to cushion the blow to their purchasing power from the high inflation. And that's allowed consumers to continue to do their thing. You know, they're not out there spending with abandon, but they're doing what they typically do and it's because of that cash cushion.</p><p>There's still a lot left, particularly for middle and high income households. I mean just to give you a number, at the peak, there was $2.5 trillion worth of excess saving. Now we're down to 1.6 trillion. So it's down, but it's still considerable. But you know, low income households, they likely have blown through that excess saving that cash and they no longer have that they need.</p><p>They use that to pay those gas bills and the rent and the grocery bill. And now they are turning to their credit cards and unsecured personal lines. And so we are seeing debt growth increase significantly among that group and so that's a sign of stress. So hopefully, we need that inflation to come in to take that pressure off of those households.</p><p>So they don't need to borrow quite as much to maintain their purchasing power. So it's a bit of a race here but in aggregate, consumers still have a lot of cash sitting in their bank accounts that they can use if they need to.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know I always feel sorry for the lower income households when we talk about in aggregate.</p><p>ZANDI: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And to that point, there was a headline in the time online, and you were quoted in the article and it said the U.S. economy is doing too well which is bad for the people that aren't rich, because it's always those lower income people that we're talking about now that is already borrowing on credit and racking up credit card bills.</p><p>And the question to your point about bringing inflation down is how much more expensive that credit gets as interest rates rise and how much more punishing it is for those people? How much more do you think the Fed has to do in order to be at least comfortable even if it's not back to around the 2 percent target, because I guess that's the key question?</p><p>ZANDI: I think, yes, it's a great question. And that's the crux of the matter. I mean, I think they're close.</p><p>[09:25:00]</p><p>ZANDI: You know, it feels like to me the interest rate hikes they put in place are slowing the economy down, you can feel it in the housing market, you can feel in different parts of manufacturing interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy. So it feels like things are throttling back.</p><p>And I'm hopeful that the Fed only needs to raise rates another couple three more times, quarter point each time. That's pretty much what the Fed has articulated to everyone that they're going to do. I think they'll probably follow through on that. And then I think that's the end of it, Julia.</p><p>So hopefully, by late spring, early summer, we will have seen the end of the rate hikes and not that they're going to come back down quickly. We've got they're not going to lower rates until inflation is clearly back to their target. It's more comfortable for people. I could take a while, but I think we're pretty close to the rate and --.</p><p>If we're not, then I, you know, my optimism here about the economy and avoiding recession will be misplaced, because of the higher they have to push rates, the more likely it's going to undermine the economy and push us into recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And your note this week, you talk about consumers keeping the faith and actually that recession ultimately is about consumers losing the faith. Let's assume that you're right and the Federal Reserve's predictions over what they have to do in terms of further interest rate hike are correct.</p><p>Do you buy the concept of a no landing economic outcomes? So not a hard landing, not a soft landing, that actually growth can slow inflation can come down, but we don't actually have to see any kind of recession.</p><p>ZANDI: Well, I think the yes, I think the no landing kind of a description is that the economy keeps barreling along here. But inflation keeps coming in and goes back to target and we're all good, I doubt that. You know, my sense is that you know, the economy is going to slow here, job growth is going to weaken, even to a point where unemployment starts to rise a bit.</p><p>So it's going to feel a bit uncomfortable here, Julia. I don't think there's any way around that. So I don't think we're going to experience a no landing. Soft Landing doesn't do it for me either, because I don't think it's going to be soft. You know, I call it a slow session, not a recession.</p><p>We're not going backwards, but we're going nowhere fast, so slow session. So if we're looking for the right words to describe what's dead ahead. You know, I don't think soft landing, no landing that doesn't work for me, you know, slow session feels like a much better description of what's coming.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, actually the perfect word. So slow session and the word aggregate is now formally banned on \"First Move\". Mark Zandi, thank you so much --.</p><p>ZANDI: OK --.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. Mark Zandi, great to chat to you! OK, coming up after the break. What are you afraid of China criticizes the United States for banning TikTok from government devices all the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\"! Where U.S. stocks are up and running this Tuesday and an unsettled open as Wall Street closes out February trading a challenging month too for stocks, with all the major averages currently down by more than 2 percent.</p><p>Not a lot of Valentine's month hearts out there as investors pour over the charts. The stock news today too, call it perhaps the return of the lockdown stock. Zoom shares are zooming ahead after earnings beat and strong forward guidance context though is key as always.</p><p>Zoom is still down 44 percent this past year amid the uncertain outlook for teleconferencing post lockdowns. Shares of retailer target in the meantime pretty flat in early trade, the company beating on earnings but offering weaker forward guidance, as we discussed earlier warning that consumers are spending less on discretionary type items.</p><p>And in the meantime, China has accused the United States of being afraid of an app popular with young people after the White House ordered federal agencies to ban TikTok within 30 days on government issued devices as this move has been ordered by Canada and the EU, of course, too. Kevin Liptak joins us now from Washington, D.C.</p><p>Kevin, great to have you with us! U.S. officials had raised concerns that the Chinese government could order ByteDance, which owns TikTok to hand over important data. And this was Congress's decision to act and now we're following through?</p><p>KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, exactly, right. Remember, Congress passed this at the end of last year now the White House is telling government agencies that they have 30 days to wipe TikTok off of devices used by federal employees.</p><p>Now that there had been a number of departments and agencies within the federal government who had already taken this step places like the Pentagon, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security who are handling the most sensitive data?</p><p>But this would apply to the rest of the federal government and the White House says that this will be a critical step in protecting sensitive government information. Now TikTok, the company did respond yesterday they said that this was no more than political theater.</p><p>They said the ban on TikTok on federal devices passed in December without any deliberation. And unfortunately, that approach has served as a blueprint for other world governments. And that is correct, as you mentioned, places like Canada and the EU also considering taking similar steps that would prevent federal employees from using TikTok on their government devices.</p><p>But this is clearly a hot button political issue in the United States as well. And in fact, even today, Julia, Republicans in the House are moving forward on legislation that would give President Biden greater leeway in making a nationwide ban on TikTok, effectively making it illegal to use on any phones in the United States.</p><p>A number of states have also implemented their own bans on government devices. And what you're seeing in some states is they're abandoning TikTok for use on campuses on state colleges and universities.</p><p>So really trying to crack down on this app where they really fear that user's privacy could be at risk information could be shared with the Chinese government. But this could prove politically unpopular as well.</p><p>Two thirds of teens in the United States use TikTok. So this is clearly a hot button issue that President Biden will be dealing with as part of a broader crackdown on China part of a broader look at how the U.S. is dealing with China in the months ahead.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, ordinary citizens giving up their data is perhaps one thing, government officials and protected information quite another. Kevin, thank you for that, Kevin Liptak! OK, now to some stunning testimony from the media mogul Fox News.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch has admitted in a deposition that some of his FOX Hosts endorsed 2020 election lies. His statements made as part of Dominion's voting systems 1.6 dollar lawsuit, billion dollar lawsuit against the network. Just take a listen to have some FOX anchors talked about that 2020 vote.</p><p>[09:35:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEITH RUPERT MURDOCH, AUSTRALIAN-AMERICAN INVESTOR: The President's lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, THEN- FOX NEWS HOST: This President has to take, I believe, drastic action, dramatic action to make certain that the integrity of this election is understood or lack of it, the crimes that have been committed against him and the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Oliver Darcy joins us on this now. Oliver much to discuss on this, but I just want to hone in what Rupert Murdoch admitted was that while FOX News didn't and that's key, some of his top hosts were pushing election lies out to the audience, and they knew they were doing it?</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Yes, this is really strengthening, I think, Dominion's case against FOX News, because FOX has argued up until now that they only aired newsworthy statements about the election, after it was called for Biden. In other words, they didn't endorse these election lies. But they had commentators and others say these things on its air.</p><p>Now we're seeing in this deposition where Rupert Murdoch is under oath, and he admits to Dominion that some of his top hosts did indeed endorse these election lies. Election lies that he was privately referring to as damaging to the country as \"BS\" but he was allowing those commentators those hosts to go on his network and peddle this lie to viewers. It really exposes this network is not really a news organization, but one that was profiting off of frankly, lying, actively lying to its own audience.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And they were being warned by people like the Former House Speaker, Paul Ryan, that viewers believed that they're watching credible sources, and we're being fed a diet of lies. And we have a sense of what the implications were of that.</p><p>But I think you raised a very important point, which goes, I think, to the business model of media, in that there was this fears that if you start telling the truth, or you don't give salacious details or lies in this case, you lose eyeballs. And that's a problem too, for an anchor.</p><p>DARCY: News networks at the core are the business models built on delivering the truth to viewers and that's not always easy. And there are some imperfections, sometimes news networks mess up, but they're honest with viewers at their core.</p><p>In this case, what we're seeing from Dominion is these documents that FOX News knew privately behind the scenes that Trump's election lies were exactly that lies. They privately trashed these lies in communications between themselves behind the curtain.</p><p>But when they went on air, when the cameras turned on, they fed these lies to the audience. And that is not really a business model of a news network. That's the business model of a right wing talk network of a propaganda channel.</p><p>But it's really important to distinguish what FOX was doing from what actual news organizations were doing at the time, which is fact checking the President. And these dangerous lies he was telling about the U.S. election system.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, there's a fine line there. I would argue the business model of TV, unfortunately, is advertising. And that's based on eyeballs. And that's where the gray lines start to appear in terms of content. But that's a way bigger topic of conversation, Oliver I think a part of the dangers that we're facing, not just in TV, but in social media too.</p><p>Bringing it back to this and to Dominion, even if Dominion lose this case, Oliver has raised huge questions to all of your points, I think about the conduct, whether it's a FOX News itself, or specific anchors that were mentioned here?</p><p>DARCY: Yes, I mean, I think this is certainly scared FOX away from mentioning Dominion on air. We saw for instance, on Sunday, the channel's top media anchor say that he had been forbidden from covering this story on air as this lawsuit continues to get underway, which is actually quite a striking admission. So FOX is just ignoring this altogether.</p><p>But I will say that the anchors, there or the hosts there I hate to call them anchors, they're still sowing doubts about the 2020 election. You know, after one of these legal documents dropped the other week, Tucker Carlson led his show, by again, casting doubt on the validity that Biden won a fair election.</p><p>I mean, you can't really make this stuff up. It just again, highlights and underscores that these people are willing to actively lie to their audience and, you know, they talk about how they need to risk respect their audience and I guess in their eyes.</p><p>[09:40:00]</p><p>DARCY: That means feeding them whatever content validates their views, even if their views are predicated on false pretenses. I would argue that a true respect for the audience is being upfront with them not treating them like they can't handle the truth. But again, with just not what we're seeing from FOX.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Maybe the viewers can but the ratings can't. Oliver and just to complete the circle on this, Rupert Murdoch did say, \"I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight\", at another point in the deposition, just to make that clear. Oliver Darcy, thank you for that.</p><p>OK, coming up after the break, can I have a rubbish story for you? Yes, I do. The startup recycling food waste into feed for chickens. Don't panic. I'll explain after this.</p><p>(COMMERCICAL BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\"! Food waste is filling our landfills and worsening the climate crisis. The gases it generates accounts for 8 to 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.</p><p>And my next guest, who originally pioneered the Nest Learning Thermostat, has now turned his attention to changing all that with a startup that collects discarded food products. A third of food is wasted here in the United States alone and ends up in places like this.</p><p>The service called \"Mill\" provides consumers with a special compositing bin, which grinds up food waste overnight. The end product is then mailed back to the firm for processing into chicken feed. Matt Rogers is the Co- Founder and CEO of Mill and joins us now. Matt fantastic to have you on the show!</p><p>I can understand the premise here. Get rid of the leftover food that you have in your kitchens and actually make it into something useful and help the planet along the way. Just explain how the bin works and the secret process behind it?</p><p>MATT ROGERS, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF MILL: Yes. So Mill is a new system to prevent food waste at home. It starts with a new bin that you put in your kitchen that takes all the food that you don't eat dries and grinds it. It doesn't smell. It takes weeks to fill up. Then we have a service to come pick it up from your door to get it back to us to get it back to farms to feed chickens.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I love the fact that it doesn't smell so you've worked on some kind of technology to prevent that because that was one of the first things that jumped out at me. What about noise and what about energy? And how often do you have to run it?</p><p>ROGERS: Yes. So it runs automatically, overnight. And the most important thing for us this has to be a better experience than people are dealing with today at home and no one likes trash. Think about ripping bags and dripping in their hallway as you take it out.</p><p>[09:45:00]</p><p>ROGERS: So we want to make an experience that is just better, better for you better for the planet and better for cities.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And what about noise and how much energy? I think I read, it takes about the same energy as a dishwasher running overnight?</p><p>ROGERS: Yes, it takes about a kilowatt hour of energy a day, which actually, in the grand scheme of things is actually not very much. We're offsetting about a half a ton of emissions per household per year by using the Mill service. Methane emissions from landfills are actually an enormous part of the climate equation. So it's really important that we keep food out of the trash.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And I'm assuming it's some kind of process that dehydrates the food, then what's the process to make it from whatever is provided in to get sent back to you into chicken feed? And what are the regulations around that because obviously, ultimately, people are going to be eating these chickens too? So that was one of the other things that sort of occurred to me.</p><p>ROGERS: What's cool is what comes out of our bin is still food. It's just dried food it has all the nutrition, the calories and the protein that were in the food originally. So when we get it back to us, we sift it and filter it to make sure there are no contaminants. Someone didn't put a plastic bottle in by accident. We pasteurize it again, and we create a safe and nutritious ingredient for chicken feed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And there's no regulations around it all there are regulations around it, or you're already feeding chickens, because I know you've only just begun. So I'm sort of asking lots of questions and fasting forward. But it's, it's early days, I know?</p><p>ROGERS: Yes, we're still going through the required scientific and regulatory process to create a safe and nutritious ingredient for chicken feed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How long is that going to take?</p><p>ROGERS: It should take a few more months. And out of respect for the process, I don't want to go into too much - too many details on how that's going.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You can just tease me. Now, here comes the crux, the cost per month $33?</p><p>ROGERS: So for $1 a day, you get a better kitchen experience, and you feel good about doing something for the planet. Over time, what we're seeing is we could build agreements with cities where cities could provide this in an augmentation to their trash service today.</p><p>For example, we just signed a pilot agree with the City of Tacoma, Washington, where they're going to provide their residents, the Mill kitchen bin experience, and you could downsize your trash bin and basically get Mill for free.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, so when I was testing the water on this, because I always like to do this. I personally hate the idea and the smell and everything. So for me, it was like this is a genius idea. The more people I spoke to the idea of $33 a month, people were like particularly in apartment buildings, which is separate, but they were concerned about the cost. So the real business model here for you, you're saying is to work with cities to work with localities, and hopefully offset that cost.</p><p>ROGERS: That's right. We spend an exorbitant amount of money managing waste today. I think the U.S. spends about $200 billion a year just managing waste, which effectively means throwing it away and throwing it in the landfill. So you can imagine over time, us taking some of those dollars to prevent waste from ever existing. It's a much more efficient way of running our system, and it's better for the planet.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: OK, and you've always had conversations with investors, I know because you've risen more than $100 million on this talk to me about that process too?</p><p>ROGERS: So even in today's economic climate, there is a lot of interest in climate friendly solutions that are also good for people where the better the plant good, is also just better for you. You think about electric vehicle electric.</p><p>Electric vehicles are better than gas powered vehicles or Nest Thermostats are better than what came before that. You know, investors are interested in the water solutions that take the planet forward, but also are just better for us.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is the conversation are those conversations harder, though, to your point about the economic environment? We've certainly seen a lot of job cutting from the tech sector, in particular in a sort of a reassessment of valuations. Are those conversations harder? Or is it OK, if you're in the planet protection game?</p><p>ROGERS: From my experience, it feels like the climate tech environment is more resilient than the general tech environment. And maybe that's because of government intervention and the IRA. The needs of the climate crisis, the climate crisis is not going away, regardless of economic cycles. So if you think about how much the economy needs to change over the next decade, a lot of new businesses already created.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, final quick question that my mother's going to approve of this question because things always disappear when her children are home. What happens if you throw a spoon or a knife in there? How robust is it?</p><p>ROGERS: So nothing will break the bin at home. And when you send that spoon back to us, we'll filter it out. It's actually pretty easy for us to catch. No big deal.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just checking. Yes, we might not get it back. But at least the chicken won't get it. Matt great to have you with us, thank you so much! We'll track your progress thank you. Matt Rogers the Co-Founder and CEO of Mill there, stay with CNN more to come.</p><p>[09:50:00]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to \"First Move\"! Fascinating new research is underway into the cause of so called Zombie wildfires. Now they're blazes that inexplicably come back to life. CNN's Allison Chinchar reports in the latest edition of transformers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice over): It's summer in the remote boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories. And Rebecca Scholten, along with an international team of researchers is on the hunt for signs of a rare and destructive phenomenon.</p><p>REBECCA SCHOLTEN, PHD STUDENT/VU AMSTERDAM: So the first thing you notice when you get to a site that has - had a zombie fire is that a lot of these trees have fallen over. And that is because of the underground burning that is happening.</p><p>CHINCHAR (voice over): In 2015 this region of boreal forest was the scene of an overwintering fire, also known as a zombie fire. These are rare, so we don't have any footage of them, but they can look just like these regular forest fires, except they're back from the dead.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So these are fires that are not extinguished at the end of the fire season. But instead, they smoldered deep into the organic soil layer. And when the snow comes the snow kind of protects them from the adverse winter conditions.</p><p>And that makes it possible for them to smolder all throughout winter. And when the snow melts, and there's dry fuels available again, these fires come up to the surface again and start a new flaming forest fire.</p><p>CHINCHAR (voice over): In 2021, Scholten published the first ever scientific study to detect zombie fires using satellites and reports from local fire managers as part of her PhD. For example, in the summer of 2015, a fire in Southwest Alaska blazed across 26 square miles.</p><p>Winter came and snow covered the fire site. But the following spring, the fire returned along the old burn scar evidence Scholten says of a zombie fire. By burning through the soil and the roots zombie fires can be more damaging to the forest than regular fires, making it harder for them to recover.</p><p>But that's not all. These boreal soils store huge amounts of carbon, so burning them releases it as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Zombie fires are rare, but shortly found that they are increasing due to climate change.</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So I think zombie fires are very good poster - for what is happening to Arctic wildfires in general.</p><p>[09:55:00]</p><p>SCHOLTEN: So we see fire regimes are intensifying. And this has very important impacts on the ecosystems that of course have an impact on our climate. And that is why I think everyone in the world should care about these fires.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we should. And that's it for the show. If you've missed any of our interviews today, there will be on my Twitter and Instagram pages you can search for @jchatterleycnn. In the meantime \"Connect the World\" with Becky Anderson is up next. And I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Photo by Rowland Scherman/National Archive/Newsmakers. If you want to find something new, look for destruction. </p><p><br/> Over a few billion years on Earth, planetary disasters created new forms of life. A meteor here. Volcanic eruptions there. Each time new plants and critters emerged until, one day, we put on pants. <br/> Look at what happens after a northern Minnesota forest fire. New growth takes over quickly. Whole new ecosystems evolve. Some species like the jack pine even thrive after such desolation. <br/> Where I live along the Mesabi Iron Range, old mines beget new landscapes. Savagely tilled extraction fields become unexpected laboratories of natural rehabilitation, mountain bikes and assorted teenage debauchery. <br/> And look at those kids. How many of them are some version of their parents, destined to produce children rather similar to themselves? Let's be conservative and say most. Change will not come from them, but rather from the broken ones, the misfits and outcasts, the ones with ideas that come from a place they can't describe, or at least not yet. <br/> They see the proud men laid low by layoffs and whiskey, the proud women imprisoned by unwritten rules. They hear the shouts of joy, sorrow and anger forming some strange new chord. The sun warms even a January day and spring musk always rises from the cold white snow. <br/> That brings us to Robert Zimmerman, a weird kid from the Iron Range town of Hibbing who went on to be known as Bob Dylan. <br/> On Monday, Bob Dylan turns 80. This Saturday, the people of his hometown, Hibbing, will break ground on a monument to honor the music and lyrics of the only songwriter to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. In fact, now begins the 'Year of Dylan,' officially ordained by St. Louis County. Events scheduled in Dylan's birthplace of Duluth and in Hibbing, where he grew up, will mark Dylan's impact on the world. <br/> I spent much of my 20s and 30s organizing Dylan-themed music and cultural events in my birthplace (also Hibbing) during the folk-rock troubadour's birthday week. There is no greater dissonance than the gap between the experiences tourists had learning about Dylan's hometown and the attitudes of those who live here full time. The Dylan fans loved Hibbing. The locals, though, never warmed to the crowd, nor did they really seem to enjoy where they lived except in memory. It's nice to see that change, at least a little, but it was no easy progression. <br/> 'Bob Dylan hates Hibbing,' we heard. Not sometimes, but every time we posted about Bob Dylan's Hibbing story. <br/> Bob Dylan doesn't hate Hibbing. He speaks highly of it, or at least of how the place shaped his sensibilities. He didn't stick around and work in the mines, though. They've got him there. <br/> Dylan grew up in the 1940s and '50s. Post-WWII Hibbing was an amazing place that seemed to be living on borrowed time. A big beautiful school still recruited the best teachers in the state to profess the arts, humanities, and elite technical skills. And yet, as wartime production scaled down, mines closed and consolidated. The economic fortunes of downtown Hibbing wilted like September leaves. Many thought it was all over. It wasn't, but some people never stopped thinking that. <br/> In fact, Hibbing of that era was actively burying a past few today truly understand. The town had mostly moved in the 1920s to allow U.S. Steel to mine ore beneath the old village. But even during the 1950s vestiges of old North Hibbing remained in use. <br/> Dylan grew up as the old town sat rusting away, crumbling to earth. The images he saw can be found not only in songs like 'Girl From the North Country' or 'North Country Blues,' but throughout his catalogue. Dylan's liner notes from 'The Times They Are a' Changin'' literally describe his feelings about North Hibbing. <br/> A twisted set of circumstances molded Bob Dylan from the hard rocks and red clay of northern Minnesota. It was, quite frankly, an accident. But then that's true of many of us, and of most people who change anything at all. <br/> I don't know how long Dylan's words will carry the impact they've had over the past 60 years. Sometimes I wonder if Dylan is like a Shakespeare, his words still kicking 500 years after rigor mortis. Other times I think that he, too, will fade away with the rest of us schlubs, including all the normal kids from his old high school. <br/> Perhaps by then some new voice will feel the same north winds that Bobby Zimmerman did, and find purpose in telling an updated version of life's old story. <br/> If you want to find something new, look for destruction. That's where it is, like it or not. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW10009805162142444818225876100024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STNW-10009805</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62PT-S9T1-F03R-N06R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567766</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><timeReceived>11:40 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Minnesota Reformer</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 19, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N212210MM</classCode><className>IRON MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

Gavin Newsom, reporter Elex Michaelson asked Newsom if there's really anything a new Republican governor could do with super-duper Democratic majorities in the legislature and with every statewide office in the hands of a Democrat.</p><p><br/>\"You can line-item veto everything coming out of the legislature...You can start to vandalize all the executive orders. You can eliminate the masking requirement for public schools. You can eliminate the vaccine requirements for public healthcare workers. So, many of the things that I signed through executive order can be done overnight.\"<br/>Newsom very well could spend hours opining on numerous powers unique to the office of the governor, many of which he has used to great effect in the past.<br/>Upon being sworn in, a new governor could revoke every last emergency order related to the pandemic. Before those signatures are dry, he could call seven special sessions to deal with the major crises that Newsom has fueled with his regressive policies, including:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>crime</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>water shortages/drought</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>wildfires</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>housing supply</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>homelessness/mental illness</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>government fraud</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>pandemic</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>Each session would be accompanied by a robust list of legislative priorities Californians have been demanding for years.<br/>Though the Legislature will have concluded business the week before the recall election, they must respond to the governor's call for special sessions, leaving behind the cover they've enjoyed over the past 18 months under the authoritarian executive. Legislators could continue to abdicate their duties by simply opening and closing sessions without actually doing anything, but a new governor could remind them of the 2022 redistricting battles that may hold them accountable for inaction.<br/>The new governor will have significant influence over the 2022-23 state budget, the fight over which begins in earnest in October. Despite hundreds of billions of extra dollars thanks to federal COVID subsidies, California still faces substantial, long-term financing troubles. While Gov. Newsom boasts of the biggest state budget in history, the titanic funds undergirding the budget are one-time revenues that will tank once the Federal Reserve stops printing money and Congress avoids propping up spendthrift programs.<br/>A new governor could issue guiding principles for the upcoming budget that will align expenditures and revenue. First, he could end all non-immediate, recurring expenditures. Excess budget funds should pay down long-term debt, not create new programs. This leader should then alert the counties that they will assume their role as the legal subdivisions and functional arm of the state, drastically reducing state bureaucracies duplicated within counties.<br/>Newsom's replacement could require every department head to produce a zero-based budget by Thanksgiving, justifying every expenditure with state statute and propose changes in law that would further streamline their responsibilities. For every budget that can't be zero-based and built anew, ask for the department head's resignation. Next, the new governor could require the Department of Finance to set up a metric by which all future contracts will be negotiated and seek ways to reduce state employees by attrition and incentives since more state services going forward would be run by the counties.<br/>The new governor should implement absolute budget transparency and accountability. Ohio did it with their finances for less than what the governor makes in his annual salary and now, taxpayers have so much transparency that they can see what their governor ate for lunch. Next, the governor should send a memo to the management of every agency, department, commission, office and bureau and inform them of two things. First, the new administration will pursue a new course. Second, the memo must remind state government employees that they have a right to leave their government union and cease paying dues.<br/>The governor should then make two more phone calls - the first to the independent State Auditor Elaine Howle to ask her to assemble a comprehensive list of every audit recommendation that previous administrations either ignored or rejected. Once compiled, send this list to every affected agency secretary and department head with the order to have a plan for full compliance within two weeks, allowing a modified appeal process if there are legitimate concerns for which the audit recommendations cannot be feasibly implemented. Apply the same due diligence with all internal department and agency audits as well as those from the Office of State Audits and Evaluations at the Department of Finance.<br/>The second call should be to the governor's press secretary to schedule a comprehensive press conference for the evening of Day 2 to outline his priorities and actions for the next several weeks.<br/>A new governor can also reassert executive authority to expedite all infrastructure, water and housing projects that have been delayed by environmental review or opposed by not-in-my-backyard activists. That includes building the Sites and Temperance Flats reservoirs, housing developments that have already received ministerial approval from their local governments, and forest fire mitigation projects delayed for years. And without breaking a sweat, the new governor can stop all construction on the $100 billion high-speed rail boondoggle immediately, withdraw all eminent-domain lawsuits, and redirect only enough funds to retrofit bypasses intended for trains to instead be used as trucking lanes.<br/>And for the schools, the governor should significantly reduce the Department of Education to a level that simply processes federal funds and mandates and otherwise redirect billions of dollars of administrative costs to the 58 counties offices of education directed to any program local school boards deem appropriate.<br/>During a new governor's first weeks in office, he should travel the state and talk to the people. Ask the best and brightest people to help deal with the many problems the current government can't seem to address. Take recommendations from the people and create a Red Team Task Force that will organize these issues and propose innovative ways to deal with them. Let the people talk at open forums and town halls.<br/>If a new governor is elected this month, that person will have one year to whip into shape a bloated, sleepy and sloppy state bureaucracy that has festered in mediocrity for years. And if the Legislature or entrenched bureaucracy is going to resist, the governor should plan for a one-hour presser every day to name names and let the people know why things aren't changing.<br/>Trust the people and remember, there is no time to waste.<br/>This article originally appeared in the\u00a0California

To verify accuracy, please compare to our digital microfilm at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stltoday.newspapers.com\">www.stltoday.newspapers.com</url>. A COVID-19 outbreak connected to Kanakuk Kamps, a large Christian camp network in Branson and Lampe, Missouri, continues to spread, according to state health officials.</p><p>The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services reported Monday that the number of COVID-19 positive cases has jumped to 82 among campers, counselors and staff members. The number of positive cases was 49 on Friday. Those testing positive come from 10 different states and multiple counties in Missouri.</p><p>Elizabeth Miranda, an employee with the registration office at the camp, said only one camp session, or term, has been canceled and a few others shortened from two weeks to one.</p><p>\"We have closed term 3 at K-2 early. As of right now, that is the only session that has been closed. We have shortened terms 4 and 5 at K-2 as well, but those sessions are not closed. None of our other five Kamps has closed terms,\" Miranda said in an email.</p><p>Dr. Jason Newland, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Washington University, said the camp should immediately close all its terms.</p><p>\"This just isn't worth it,\" he said. \"Just close them down.\"</p><p>Newland and his wife have sent their daughters to Kanakuk Kamps in the past, but they decided against sending them this summer.

They also understand that climate adaption in fire-prone countries is inadequate to deal with wildfires that are set to worsen. <br/>We look at why Mediterranean and Balkan countries are so prone to wildfires and explore the consequences of a warming world.  <br/> 1. Why are Mediterranean regions so fire-prone? <br/>Summer wildfires are a natural and often necessary part of the life of Mediterranean forests. In the decade before 2016, around 48,000 forest fires burned 457,000 hectares (ha) annually across the five southern European nations where wildfires are most prevalent: Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Greece. According to the scientists, fire breeds renewal and can foster biodiversity in these regions. <br/>Indeed, communities have learned to cope better with the average annual fires in hot and arid regions across southern Europe, with more sophisticated fire prevention strategies leading to an overall decline in the number and size of fires since 1980. <br/>But too often in recent years, fire events have escalated way beyond their normal size and intensity. <br/>Devastating 2017 and 2018 wildfires claimed hundreds of lives across an area stretching from Turkey to Spain, while countries in central and northern Europe, including Sweden, were also scorched.  <br/>Such unprecedented fire events are inevitably linked to extreme droughts and heatwaves.  <br/><br/> 2. What is starting the fires? <br/>The month of July was the second-hottest ever recorded in Europe (and the third hottest globally). The south of the continent has been the focus of this extreme heat, with temperatures in Greece this week expected to peak at 47 degrees Celcius (117 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/>Greece and neighboring Turkey are in the midst of a heatwave that could be the worst in 30 years \u2014 invoking memories of the nightmarish 1987 fire season that claimed over 1,500 victims in Greece alone. <br/>In Turkey, almost 200 separate wildfires have raged through the country in just over a week, forcing some coastal residents and tourists to flee into the Adriatic for safety. <br/>So while arson and natural causes such as lightning are equally to blame for starting the fires, extreme heat has increased their intensity and is the real culprit for the destruction wreaked across fire-hit regions. This is why over 55% more area has burnt across Europe by August 5 than the average over the previous 12 years. <br/> This fact is compounded by outdated forest management, and sometimes even the over-protection of natural forests. <br/>A fire on August 1 blazed through the Pineta Dannunziana, an urban pine forest in the Italian city of Pescara, forcing 800 people to evacuate. But because the area is a protected nature reserve it is not subject to forest management, and therefore not regularly cleared of debris. \"The undergrowth burned very quickly,\" said Carlo Masci, mayor of Pescara. <br/>\"In most Mediterranean regions, the current wildfire management policies are generally too focused on suppression and are no longer adapted to the ongoing global change,\" wrote the authors of a 2021 study on \"Understanding Changes to Fires in Southern Europe.\" <br/>3. So what has climate got to do with it? <br/>While the burnt area of the Mediterranean region has decreased slightly over the last 40 years, this is mainly due to more effective fire control efforts, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA). <br/>Global heating increases the frequency and severity of fire weather conditions globally \u2014 as witnessed during the unprecedented wildfires across Australia and California in recent years. And inevitably, climate change has increased forest fire risk across the whole of Europe, including central and northern regions that are not typically prone to fires. <br/><br/>The current record droughts and heatwaves across the Mediterranean region echoes the events of 2018 when \"more countries suffered large fires than ever before,\" according to the EEA. <br/>In Greece, over 100 people died in the so-called Attica fires of 2018 \u2014 the second-deadliest fire event this century after the 2009 Black Saturday fires in Australia.  <br/>\"An expansion of fire-prone areas and longer fire seasons are projected in most European regions,\" stated the EEA.  <br/>Carbon emissions are not decreasing fast enough to limit this heating, despite climate agreements such as the European Green Deal and Paris Climate Accord. <br/>\"They put out plans, they define goals, but they don't really act,\" said Mojib Latif, a climate scientist at the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research. \"Since 1990, global carbon emissions increased 60%,\" he told DW, adding that emissions will rise again in 2021 following the pandemic-related slowdown the previous year. <br/> 4. What are the repercussions for the climate? <br/>Globally, wildfires are responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions, and for 5-8% of the 3.3 million annual premature deaths from poor air quality, according to climate NGO, Carbon Brief. <br/>But carbon emissions from wildfires have been on the decline in recent decades. This again is due to improved fire prevention. <br/>The problem remaining is fire severity or intensity, which has a more far-reaching effect on carbon sequestration since forests burn so badly that they do not regrow. <br/>In 2017, CO2 emissions from extreme wildfires across southwestern Europe (namely the Iberian Peninsula, southern France and Italy) were the highest since at least 2003, reaching approximately 37 Tg CO2. <br/>To put this in context, the exceptionally large wildfires over the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean coast in 2003 accounted for the same level of anthropogenic emissions as all of western Europe. <br/>And if the wildfire intensity kills off significant forest cover in 2021, the resulting loss of carbon sinks could be even more devastating for the climate. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109989162819813703325879100067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639J-PWM1-JCMN-Y4VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><timeReceived>9:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 5, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

Between 97 and 99 percent of climate researchers actively publishing in refereed scientific journals agree that human activity is responsible for Earth's rapid warming. (Before expressing a dissenting view, anyone who is not a Ph.D. climate scientist should carefully study the material at the source Ferrarin identified in her article.) </p><p>The initial effects of global warming are already here, from unprecedented monster hurricanes to unmatched forest-fire infernos. Even in Illinois, in recent years our farmers have experienced well-known effects of a heating climate. Including record droughts followed by record flooding. While we don't know exactly when the point of no return will be reached, Elgin is right to treat climate change as an emergency. To treat it otherwise is to act like a blind man striding toward the edge of a cliff. He will not know exactly when he will have gone too far. But if he wants to survive, he must act immediately. Of course, it is the federal government that must take the big actions and resume global leadership. This won't happen unless Joe Biden is elected president and the Democrats gain control of both the House and Senate. So, to prevent what is likely to become the 6th global mass extinction if we don't act soon, the most urgent emergency response must be to campaign for Democrats at every level. Cities like Elgin also have an important part to play. Obviously cost as well as benefits must be carefully analyzed. But, as identified in the article, there are many low- or no-cost actions that can provide substantial benefits. Darold T. Barnum Oak Park A harsh lesson What damage a school district can do. We live in a time when the sins of our fathers are ever present in everyday life. It is imperative that we as future generations recognize, investigate and then act on these harmful behaviors. We are surrounded in our daily lives with so many of them it is hard to be calm in the face of everyday living. I am speaking to the mass destruction of decades-old trees and bushes surrounding a schoolyard at Madison Elementary in Wheaton. The powers that be gave an order to destroy the tree-lined perimeter of this property and remove all vegetation. They even cut down trees not on district property. This is a school that once hung a sign on a schoolyard tree from Morton Arboretum as a Champion of Trees. These children have just been taught that our environment is expendable. That honoring and following EPA guidelines is a joke. That following the laws and regulations of FEMA land management in a flood zone doesn't apply to them. This school district appears to have no value for neighborhood values and environments. This complete decimation of vegetation is not reversible and cannot be corrected with a few token trees and wood chips. I wish I could stop being forced to give my tax dollars for education for these destructive and punitive events.

(AP) - Connor Jones sunbathed with his dog on the otherwise empty beach at Ski Run Marina on Monday, as residents trickling back into town filled up their cars at a gas station behind him and employees of a water sports rental company docked jet skis and boats they had anchored away from the shores of Lake Tahoe to prevent them from igniting from wildfire.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>He and others living in the resort city of South Lake Tahoe breathed a collective sigh of relief on Sunday when officials downgraded a mandatory evacuation order put in place a week ago to a warning.<br/>\"I figure they wouldn't take repopulation lightly and, if they made the decision to allow people to come back, then they were probably confident that they're not going to have any issues,\" he said.<br/>When the Caldor Fire gobbled up pine trees and crossed the Sierra Nevada last week, South Lake Tahoe, a scenic community of 22,000 people on the California-Nevada state line, transformed into a smoke-choked ghost town.<br/>After worrying throughout all of last week about the fire approaching their homes and landmarks they hold dear, residents who returned on Monday said they were thankful firefighters had stopped the blazes on the town's doorstep. But it appeared most residents remained away and most shops remained closed in usually thriving Labor Day destination town.<br/>While many large wildfires have ripped through large swaths of Northern California in recent years, it's the first time in more than a decade that South Lake Tahoe residents saw a blaze get this close. As of Monday evening, 5,072 firefighting personnel were battling the Caldor Fire, which had scorched roughly 338 square miles.<br/>The threat to the region hasn't entirely vanished, with mandatory evacuation orders remaining for parts of unincorporated El Dorado County south of South Lake Tahoe, including Meyers and Christmas Valley. And questions remain about the smoke blanketing the region and how long it may take for the clean air and crystalline waters that draw millions of tourists to the area annually to return.<br/>Authorities warned residents, that in the absence of humans, bears had gone to town, spreading trash. \"The delicate balance between humans and bears has been upset,\" and anyone who thinks a bear may have entered their home should call law enforcement, El Dorado County Sheriff's Sgt. Simon Brown said.<br/>Chirawat Mekrakseree said he had seen signs. of bears sifting through the trash at his restaurant on Lake Tahoe Boulevard, My Thai Cuisine.<br/>Mekrakseree plans to reopen and start serving curries and noodle dishes on Wednesday but worries the tourists he depends on may not come back while the smoke lingers. And he doesn't know what to tell his staff about when business will return to normal after an already uncertain year with the pandemic, he said.<br/>\"Everybody has expenses, rent, car payments,\" he said as he power-washed ash off picnic tables. \"They're asking me how long (until they return to work) and I can't tell them how long.\"<br/>California and much of the U.S. West have experienced dozens of wildfires in the past two months as the drought-stricken region swelters under hot, dry weather and winds drives flames through bone-dry vegetation. More than 14,500 firefighters were battling 14 active fires in the state on Monday, and since the year began more than 7,000 wildfires have devoured 3,000 square miles.<br/>The lifting of mandatory evacuation orders for the Tahoe area marked a milestone in the fight against the Caldor Fire, which erupted Aug. 14 and spread across nearly 338 square miles of dense national parks and forests, tree-dotted granite cliffs and scattered cabins and hamlets in the northern Sierra Nevada. At its peak, the fire was burning as many as 1,000 acres an hour and virtually razed the small community of Grizzly Flats.<br/>In recent days, winds eased and firefighters took advantage of the weather to hack, burn and bulldoze fire lines, managing to contain 44 percent of the perimeter by Monday. Authorities said containment lines were holding up but they were concerned about extremely low humidity and a slight increase in wind.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-7927013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63SN-K4B1-JBSN-014K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Columbian Publishing Co.

During their conversation, the rapper named the people who have helped him during his recovery.\"Currently, my drug of choice is happiness and commitment to the art, rather than commitment to a vice that I believed made the art,\" Kelly shared. \"I'm taking steps. </p><p>I had my first therapy session last Thursday. That's the first time I ever went, 'Hey, I need to separate these two people,' which is Machine Gun Kelly and Colson Baker. The dichotomy is too intense for me.\"Talking about his mentors throughout his journey, the musician saidhis frequent collaborator Travis Barker has been \"huge in the process of grounding\" him. He also acknowledged how having a partner like Fox helped him, especially during the \"dark nights.\"\"When you have a partner, mine being Megan, sitting there with you on those dark nights when you're sweating and not being able to figure out why you're so in your head, to help you get out of your head and put it in perspective, that really, really helps,\" Kelly said.Kelly and Fox also talked about their relationship in an interview with Nylon[2] last month. The \"Forget Me Too\" singersaid love is \"finding someone that can take you out of the fast lane and make sure that you're safe, because at any minute you can crash   I love that it can evolve into that.\"For her part, Fox said there was no attempt on her end to control him. But he looks to her to avoid his own self-destructive tendencies and that's how she helped him. \"Loving him is like being in love with a tsunami or a forest fire,\" the actresssaid. \"The intensity of merging with him is just overwhelming, and the threat it poses is so powerful but so beautiful that you have no choice to surrender with reverence and with gratitude.\"Fox just filed for divorce[3] from her estranged husband Brian Austin Green, with whom she shares sonsJourney, 4,Bodhi, 6, andNoah, 8. They split in November 2019 after 10 years of marriage.An unnamed source told E! News[4] recently that it took a year for Fox to file for divorce as she and Green made sure to get everything in order first.\"They needed to hash out custody and figure everything out.

On Friday night's edition of CNN Tonight, Lemon introduced viewers to the story of the massive lawsuit[1] by playing multiple clips from Fox News personalities like Lou Dobbs, Tucker Carlson, and Maria Bartiromo making claims that are the subject of the suit. He followed the montage by noting 'Well, a spokesperson for Fox tells CNN the network is proud of its election coverage and describes it as being in the highest tradition of American journalism,' then added a wry 'Okay.' </p><p>The Fox News statement provided to Mediaite[2] read, in full, 'FOX News Media is proud of our 2020 election coverage, which stands in the highest tradition of American journalism, and will vigorously defend against this baseless lawsuit in court.' 'Yeah, Don, it's right in front of us,' Honig said, then added 'This lawsuit is a real threat to Fox News. This thing has real teeth.' Honig and Lemon then broke down the suit, and what the plaintiffs need to prove: HONIG: Look, there are two things, let's bring it down, that Dominion has to prove. One, the statements were false. We don't even need to waste any time on that. We all know the statements were false. The second thing is that Fox News knew they were false or recklessly disregarded the falsity. I mean, look, take it from Sidney Powell. Sidney Powell herself, one of the main architects of this whole big lie, has said this was so ridiculous that no reasonable person would have believed it. Now, Fox News, what are they going to say? We were so dense. We were so dumb that we believed it? They're in a tough spot. LEMON: Yeah. I just want to read from the suit, OK? And it says here, it says, Fox took a small flame and turned it into a forest fire. As the dominant media company among those viewers dissatisfied with the election results, Fox gave these fictions a prominence they otherwise would never have achieved. This suit is a systematic takedown of Fox's role in spreading that big role, and Dominion is not expected to settle here. So, what if they take this all the way to court? What are we going to learn here? HONIG: Boy. Well, first of all, Fox has to be a little worried about the discovery process here. That's the process where you get information from the other party. I mean, if they get to that point, if they don't settle this thing, that means Dominion is going to get to take depositions of Fox News anchors, producers, executives. That means they're going to see internal Fox memos, e-mails, that kind of thing. This could be really ugly for Fox. The other is, Don, there will be accountability here. It is a Friday night, I'll bring some good news. The big lie is crumbling and it's crumbling from within. We're seeing the leading perpetrator, whether it's Sidney Powell, Fox News is even saying our own anchors aren't to be believed. So, they're turning on each other, the big lie is being exposed. LEMON: Well, I mean, Dominion is specifically naming Maria Bartiromo in this lawsuit. Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, some of Fox's most popular hosts. Dobbs' show was actually cancelled two days after another company sued Fox over the same lies. So how much risk, if any, are they personally facing? HONIG: Yeah, look, there's real risk. You're responsible for what you say on air. And, you know, Fox has taken this interesting tack with respect to its anchors. When Tucker Carlson got sued in another case, Fox argued in court, successfully actually, at the trial court level, he is not to be believed. Who takes him seriously? He is essentially a carnival barker. At a certain point, if you call enough of your anchors carnival barkers in circus acts, you become a circus. So, I don't know how long Fox can sustain that line of defense and remain a viable, credible media entity. LEMON: That's the Sidney Powell defense, right? No reasonable person would \u2014 HONIG: Yeah. LEMON: \u2014 think that she was telling the truth. We shall see. Elie, thank you. Watch above via CNN. Have a tip we should know?

Disney's asking for a do-over.</p><p>As confirmed by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bambi-remake-works-1272457\">The Hollywood Reporter</url>\u00a0</emphasis>today, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis>, a remake of the 1942 classic traditionally animated film of the same name, has been set as The Walt Disney Company's latest remake, following blockbuster remake hits like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Jungle Book</emphasis>. Screenwriters Geneva Robertson-Dworet (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Captain Marvel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tomb Raider</emphasis>) and Lindsey Beer (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Magic Order</emphasis>) have been tapped to write the remake, bringing with them experience on major tentpole blockbusters; they have both worked on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fast &amp; Furious</emphasis> franchise. It will be produced by Depth of Field-the production company of industry veterans Chris (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Golden Compass</emphasis>, Disney's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cinderella, The Farewell</emphasis>) and Paul Weitz (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mozart in the Jungle</emphasis>) and Andrew Milano (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Farewell</emphasis>).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEE ALSO: <url normalizedValue=\"https://observer.com/2020/01/the-gentlemen-proves-guy-ritchie-is-one-of-the-worst-directors-of-our-time/\">'The Gentlemen' Proves Guy Ritchie Is One of the Worst Directors of Our Time</url></emphasis></p><p>The new <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis> will be produced as a computer-generated, photorealistic film designed to mimic live action, just like <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis> remake was. As with the announcement and release of 2019's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis>, several outlets are erroneously calling <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis> a \"live-action\" film, which is reportedly not the case. Disney undoubtedly intends for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis> to look just as visually groundbreaking as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis> did, but the original <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis>-which had a runtime of just 70 minutes-is a much more intimate affair than the Shakespearean journey Simba undertakes in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis>.</p><p>The story of a fawn who must learn to fend for himself after experiencing the shocking loss of his mother to a human hunter, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi</emphasis> has been an influential animated text for several decades. You can track the film's timeless coming-of-age narrative right up to the present in movies like Don Bluth's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Land Before Time</emphasis> and Disney's own <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Lion King</emphasis>. Updating its nearly 80-year-old story for the time of climate change, forest fire and increased sensitivity around gun control presents plenty of creative opportunity to the writers and producing team, and it'll be interesting to see what they do with it.</p><p>What's all but certain is that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bambi </emphasis>will probably make a lot of money, if Disney's remake track record is any indication. In 2019 alone, the studio's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aladdin</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lion King</emphasis> revivals raked in over $1 billion each. The next releases in that vein on the company's docket are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mulan</emphasis> in March 2020 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cruella </emphasis>in 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYOBSR-Fri24Jan2020221832+0000DisneytoKillBambi'sMomAgaininLiveActionCGIRemake</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYOBSR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2T-FS61-DY6Y-M17Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New York Observer, L.P.

This contract, which is worth 40 trillion KRW, is the largest and longest-term order POSCO Chemical has landed since its foundation.</p><p>With this contract, POSCO Chemical has expanded its product portfolio to include NCA* in addition to NCM and NCMA* cathode materials that have been mainly produced so far, as well as earning a new client, Samsung SDI, which supplies batteries to various global automakers, thereby laying the foundation for another quantum leap forward.</p><p>* NCM and NCM(A) cathode materials: cathode materials made using lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and (aluminum) as raw materials.</p><p>* NCA cathode materials: cathode materials made using lithium, nickel, cobalt, and aluminum as raw materials. A material that can maximize battery efficiency due to the high levels of battery density and output it affords.</p><p>Cathode materials account for more than 40% of battery production costs and are key materials that determine capacity and output. Cathode materials are made using lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and aluminum, and the characteristics and performance of electric vehicle batteries are determined by the combination of the raw materials used.</p><p>Since starting its cathode material business in 2012, POSCO Chemical has actively carried out research and development for product diversification in line with the rapid growth of the electric vehicle market and segmented customer needs and currently has five product groups. As POSCO Chemical is also developing lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) cathode materials, which are used for low-end electric vehicles, its product groups are expected to be further diversified depending on market conditions in the future.</p><p>Samsung SDI, on the other hand, by having a partnership with POSCO Group, which has established a full value chain from securing mining rights for lithium and nickel to material production and recycling, is now poised to acquire a stable supply chain for core materials, which are indispensable for expanding the company's global battery business.</p><p>POSCO Chemical plans to further strengthen its long-term cooperative relationship with Samsung SDI to target the electric vehicle market based on its stable global mass production capacity and raw material competitiveness.</p><p>Yoon-ho Choi, CEO of Samsung SDI, said, \"By securing a long-term, firm relationship of trust through this cooperation with POSCO Chemical, we have laid the foundation for both companies to achieve long-term, large-scale growth together.

Experiments were performed at room temperature, 100 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C, under air and simulated gas environments. The oxidation reaction of elemental mercury was conducted using steel slag samples of 1 mm, 2.36 mm, and 4.75 mm at various conditions. From the basic characteristic analysis of the steel slag, it was found that the steel slag exhibits a similar composition to that of fly ash, and it can be utilized as an oxidizing agent. Results show that regardless of the temperature and the particle size distribution of steel slag, the oxidation reaction of elemental mercury rarely occurred in the air environment. However, in the case of the HCl gas environment, it was observed that the smaller the steel slag particle size, the stronger the oxidation reaction. It is believed that the oxidation efficiency of the steel slag increased as the contact area between the gas and particles increased. The oxidation reactivity was nearly two times higher in the temperature range of 100 \u00b0C to 200 \u00b0C than it was at room temperature. It is advised that further research be undertaken in order to determine the precise temperature range at which the oxidation reaction occurs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/2/1406\">https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/2/1406</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>EXPORTS</p><p>In 2020, South Korea exported $20.4B in Iron and steel, making it the 4th largest exporter of Iron and steel in the world.

For South Korea, the steel industry provides an important foundation to other key industries such as the automotive industry and the shipbuilding industry. The importance of the material was not lost on the South Korean government, eventually leading to the establishment of the country's first steel mill in the city of Pohang under the name of POSCO in 1968. Since then, the steel industry has continued to develop into an integral part of South Korea's economy.</p><p>Who are the leading companies in South Korea's steel industry?</p><p>The position of the leading steel company in South Korea is held by POSCO, which is one of the world's leading crude steel producers. POSCO's scale of operations dwarfs that of its domestic competitors; nevertheless, the so called Big Three of the South Korean steel industry is comprised of POSCO, HyundaiSteel, and Dongkuk Steel. A subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Group, HyundaiSteel is the second largest steel company in the country. The third member of the Big Three is Dongkuk Steel, which still ranks among the upper echelon of steel companies both domestically and internationally.</p><p>How has South Korea's steel industry been performing?</p><p>The outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea has negatively affected the overall economy, including the steel industry. Production levels have decreased across various steel products, such as H-beams, as well as that of crude steel. However, the versatile use of steel ensures the livelihood of the industry for the foreseeable future, even though it might not be completely clear as to when the global economy will fully recover from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Source: Statista</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/8500/steel-industry-in-south-korea/#dossierKeyfigures\">https://www.statista.com/topics/8500/steel-industry-in-south-korea/#dossierKeyfigures</url></p><p>Market Overview</p><p>South Korean economic output suffered the COVID-19 effect along with the rest of world as exports declined by 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and again in the second quarter by 11.5 percent and services exports by 22.1 percent. That said, South Korea quickly adapted and showed its ability to meet global needs by the second half of 2020. Exports to the U.S. grew by 10.1 percent in the 3rd quarter with similar growth recorded for Taiwan, Germany, and Canada. In the 4th quarter, exports grew with South Asian and SE Asian countries.</p><p>According to Reuters, South Korea provided 310 trillion won ($270.74 billion) of fiscal support in 2020, including four extra budgets to help the country withstand the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The government approved this year's first supplementary budget worth 14.9 trillion ($12.23 billion) won in March. Additionally, South Korea unveiled a 33 trillion won ($29.2 billion) supplementary budget on July 1, 2021, the largest on record for extra spending outside its annual budget, to offer pandemic relief to households, aid small businesses and create jobs.</p><p>Korea's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020 was $1.63 trillion, ranking 12th in the world and third in East Asia (IMF estimates). Korea's national debt reached 1,985 trillion won ($1.78 trillion), surpassing its annual gross domestic product for the first time ever. As such, the IMF warned South Korea to closely monitor government spending to avoid a future debt explosion give its rapidly aging population.</p><p>As Korea's long-established strength in the steel and petrochemical industries has waned in recent years, the country's leaders are looking to more technology-intensive industries to drive future growth. The industries targeted by the Korean Government include healthcare (medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology), industrial chemicals, information technology (IT) components, semi-conductor manufacturing, aerospace and defense, energy, environmental technology, transportation (including reviving the shipbuilding industry). U.S. companies have already begun to identify opportunities in these growing industries. Additionally, U.S. firms have started partnering with local Korean companies to expand market opportunities to third-country markets, including ASEAN, the Middle East, and other Indo-Pacific markets. Korea remains one of the world's most export-dependent industrialized nations, with exports valued at 40 percent of GDP. Given its robust shipping and air cargo infrastructure, Korea serves not only as a market destination for U.S. goods and services, but also as a hub for expansion into other markets.</p><p>Source: International Trade Administration</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/south-korea-market-overview\">https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/south-korea-market-overview</url></p><p>The Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement: Benefits and Opportunities for the Canadian Mining Sector</p><p>The CKFTA is Canada's first FTA in the Asia-Pacific region. It strengthens Canada's presence in the important South Korean market and helps expand our economic footprint in this dynamic and vibrant part of the world. It also offers exporters, investors and service providers strategic access to regional and global value chains, and levels the playing field vis-\u00e0-vis their key competitors from the U.S., the EU, Australia and other countries that have concluded an FTA with South Korea. As such, the CKFTA provides a platform for Canadian companies to become increasingly competitive in the region. In terms of economic impact, the CKFTA is projected to boost Canada's GDP by $1.7 billion and result in an increase in Canada's exports to South Korea by over 30%.</p><p>Overview of Opportunities in South Korea</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>South Korea has very limited mineral resources, relying on import to meet approximately 97% of its needs in mineral resources. It imports more than 46 kinds of minerals from over 100 different countries to meet its needs.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    In terms of metal and mineral resources, South Korea's is the world's third-largest importer of coal and the fourth-largest importer of iron ore. With regard to uranium, Canada supplies approximately two-thirds of South Korea's domestic demand.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Although South Korea is Canada's sixth-largest market for commodities exports, there remains significant export growth potential as Canada does not rank in South Korea's top 10 suppliers of mineral resources and currently supplies a mere 10% of South Korea's coal imports.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    With South Korean firms eager to diversity their global supply sources for metals and minerals and to secure stable, long-term supply agreements, opportunities exists for South Korean investments into Canada's mining sector and for joint Canada-South Korea mineral development projects in third countries.   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Between 2011 and 2013, South Korea imported an annual average of $2.8 billion worth of metal and mineral products from Canada ($494 million for metals; $2.3 billion for mineral products).   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    Products of export interest include unwrought and unalloyed aluminum, aluminum alloys, unwrought nickel, nickel powders, certain ferro-alloys, and cobalt powder.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Improved Market Access for Canadian Mining Exports to South Korea</p><p>The CKFTA significantly improves market access opportunities for Canada's metals and minerals sector by eliminating tariffs on all Canadian exports, including aluminum, iron, steel, nickel, non-ferrous metals, precious gems and metals, and other mineral products. As of January 1, 2015, 98.7% of tariff lines on metals and minerals became duty-free and all remaining tariffs will be eliminated within five years (current duties of up to 8%).</p><p>For example, with the CKFTA's entry into force on January 1, 2015, tariffs were eliminated on the following metals and minerals:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    gold (duties of 3%);   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    nickel and nickel products (duties of up to 5%);   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    diamonds (duties of up to 5%); and   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    copper and zinc (duties of up to 8%).   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Coal already benefits from duty-free access to South Korea and Canadian exporters will continue to reap the benefits of duty-free access.</p><p>Duty-free access gives Canadian metals and minerals exporters preferential access to the South Korean market, and levels the playing field vis-\u00e0-vis South Korea's current FTA partners such as the United States and the European Union.</p><p>Increased Access for Services and Improved Temporary Entry</p><p>Canadian service providers in the mining sector benefit from increased and more transparent and predictable access to the South Korean service market. For example, Canadian companies benefit from preferential market access in key areas of export interest, including foreign legal consultancy services, business services and services incidental to mining. This means that Canadian companies face reduced barriers when offering services in those sectors of the South Korean market.</p><p>The CKFTA also removes barriers to temporary entry for various professionals related to the mining industry, including engineers and physical scientists, to fulfil contracts in the South Korean market. The Agreement facilitates the movement of business persons by removing barriers to entry such as economic needs tests, and ensuring new barriers are not introduced in the future, such as quotas and proportionality tests.</p><p>These temporary entry provisions are the most ambitious that South Korea has ever negotiated, which gives an advantage to Canadian companies over their U.S. and EU competitors.</p><p>Reduced Non-Tariff Barriers</p><p>The Agreement contains strong disciplines on non-tariff measures, which help Canadian businesses reap the benefits of the Agreement and prevent market access gains from being undermined by a lack of transparency or unjustified trade restrictions. These strong disciplines are backed up by comprehensive bilateral dispute settlement provisions. Specifically, the Agreement:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    promotes and requires (in the absence of good reason not to) the use of internationally accepted standards that minimize duplicative certification and testing of products;   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    improves transparency with respect to standards and regulatory development by ensuring that companies have access to information, such as laws, regulations and administrative rulings, that can affect trade;   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    encourages cooperation in bilateral, regional and multilateral forums on ways to promote increased transparency; and   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    establishes a committee whereby any standards-related concerns can be addressed and dealt with on a timely basis.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Other Key CKFTA Benefits for the Mining Sector</p><p>Investment</p><p>The CKFTA's investment provisions provide investors from both countries with a greater certainty, transparency and protection for their investments, while preserving the full right of governments to regulate in the public interest. Among other things, the Agreement provides strong disciplines against discriminatory and arbitrary treatment, protection from expropriation without prompt and adequate compensation, and access to independent international investor-state dispute settlement. The CKFTA thereby encourages increased investment activities between Canada and South Korea.</p><p>Origin Procedures and Trade Facilitation</p><p>The Agreement simplifies the process of clearing goods through South Korean customs in view of:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    clear and transparent origin procedures to administer effectively the rules of origin without creating unnecessary obstacles to trade;   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    access to advance rulings on the origin or tariff classification of products;   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    the promotion of border procedures automated through the use of information technology in order to expedite procedures for the release of goods; and   </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    an impartial and transparent system for addressing any complaints about customs rulings and decisions.   </p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Intellectual Property</p><p>The CKFTA's Intellectual Property chapter provides clear and transparent intellectual property rules that help protect Canadians that own copyright, patent or trademark rights in South Korea. The Agreement's robust provisions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights help ensure that Canadian intellectual property rights-holders can do business with confidence in the South Korean market.</p><p>Government Procurement</p><p>The Agreement provides Canadian suppliers of products and services preferential access to procurement opportunities of South Korean central government entities. Through the Agreement, Canadian suppliers of products and services benefit from secure and predictable access to covered procurement by South Korean central government agencies for contracts valued above 100 million South Korean Won (roughly $100,000). South Korea's overall government procurement market is estimated to be worth $105 billion annually.</p><p>Canadian mining exporters, investors and service providers thus stand to gain considerably from the CKFTA.</p><p>For more information on the CKFTA and prospective benefits from this Agreement, please visit Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement, or contact the Trade Commissioner Service in South Korea (   <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:seoul-td@international.gc.ca\">seoul-td@international.gc.ca</url>   ).</p><p>Source: Trade Commissioner</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/korea-republic-coree-republique/157114.aspx?lang=eng\">https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/korea-republic-coree-republique/157114.aspx?lang=eng</url></p><p>Leading Companies</p><p>Dongkuk Steel Mill Co., Ltd (KRX: 001230)</p><p>Established in 1954, DONGKUK STEEL has taken the lead in Korea's steel industry, producing cold rolled steel, galvanized steel, Galvalume (GL) steel, prepainted steel, and high performance steel for over 60 years.

In 2008, KORES was reborn with a vision to grow into one of the global top 20 players in the mining and resources sector by 2020. The ambitious transformation reflected the Korean government's strong commitments to meeting the ever growing natural resources needs of the Korean economy.</p><p>Fostering the development of the Korean resources industry</p><p>Korea had been one of the poorest countries in the world until a mere generation ago, but now as a member of the 20-50 clubs, Korea has acquired a competitive edge in manufacturing and trading sectors. In fact, Korea is world's fifth largest mineral resources consumer, mainly due to the demands from the steel, electronics, automobile, shipbuilding and chemical industries. As such, it is time to turn over a new leaf and overhaul the Korean mining and natural resources industries to keep up the pace with Korea's manufacturing sectors.</p><p>Assisting the Korean consortiums</p><p>KORES stands at the center to realize Korean government's strong commitments in fostering resources industry. We are exerting our utmost efforts to upgrade our expertise and to achieve technology innovation and professional excellence in the shortest period of time possible, so as to be on par with major global companies in the resources industry.</p><p>Our Structure</p><p>Korea is a resource-poor country which imports more than 99% of metallic minerals including copper and nickel as well as energy resources such as bituminous coal and uranium. Korea Resources Corporation was established with the aim of contributing to the development of national economy through stable supply of mineral resources which are essential for business.</p><p>KORES not only engages in overseas resources development but also provides private companies with funds and technologies for resources development at home and abroad.</p><p>In addition, we stockpile mineral resources in preparation for national emergencies and develop and distribute value-added resource development technologies.</p><p>KORES is committed to sharing accumulated experience and knowhow in overseas resources development with private companies and proactively supporting their entrance into overseas markets. We will also focus on providing tailored technology support and protecting mine accidents to pursue co-prosperity and shared growth with them.</p><p>We will continue to shape a better future and share fruits with the communities.</p><p>Business Overview</p><p>Since 2008 KORES has focused on direct foreign investment and therefore expanded its overseas projects worldwide in the form of 26 projects over 15 countries as a December, 2017.</p><p>KORES, as a state owned entity responsible for the procurement of mineral resources for national industry, focuses on six strategic minerals : bituminous coal, uranium, iron ore, copper, zinc, nickle. More recently two new strategic minerals have come under focus : REE and lithium.</p><p>As a government owned entity, KORES encourages Korean companies to participate in the overseas mineral resources development by providing technical due diligence for Korean companies. To add, KORES runs stockpile storage system for rare metals in case of emergent needs, as well as conducts mine safety and educational training to raise the quality of safety awareness in Korea.</p><p>By focusing on minerals that hold high demand in Korean industry, KORES has secured projects in Australia (mainly in coal), Africa (mainly in nickel) and last but not least South America (mainly in copper) often referred to as 'the copper belt' to the geography of mine locations on the west coast of Central &amp; South America.</p><p>El Boleo is a historic undertaking as it is the first fully Korean operated overseas mining project in KORES' history.
