(Ritchey) Hilderman complete with authentic accounts written by the late firefighter Bob Ritchey, who passed away at the age of seventy on September 27, 2019.</p><p>Hilderman shares, \"Bob Ritchey enjoyed being a wildland firefighter and EMT. He fought fire all over Montana, big and small, from Yellowstone Park to Glacier Park. One day, he and his crew got a routine call to check out some smoke, so Bob and Joe, one of his crew members, loaded up in the truck and drove to the location. It was a small fire, so Bob proceeded to walk around it to get information for Harlowton headquarters so they would know what type of equipment was needed to put out the fire. But today was not to be routine. Suddenly, the fire blew up; it surrounded Bob on all sides. When he realized that he was trapped by the fire, he had to count on God and his training to save his own life. What happened next and how he dealt with it are detailed in this book.\"</p><p>Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Sandi L. Hilderman and Robert L. Ritchey's new book will grab the attention of each reader from the first page as they discover what it truly takes to be a wildland firefighter.</p><p>Ritchey and Hilderman's story is one of determination and skill as Ritchey explores how he managed to survive a life or death situation.</p><p>Consumers canpurchase\"Into the Flames\" at traditional brick &amp;

The Forest Fire Service also announced the outcome of its investigation into the cause of the 2019 Spring Hill wildfire that burned for a month, devastating thousands of acres of in the New Jersey Pinelands, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine R. McCabe said today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The filing of civil charges comes one year after the fire burned 11,638 acres of land in Bass River and Penn State forests. A complaint signed Friday, March 20, charges five individuals with setting a fire without written permission, and failure to extinguish the fire and notify authorities. The court filing seeks approximately $50,000 in restitution.</p><p>The Forest Fire Services pursuit of those responsible for this devastating wildfire was necessary because they recklessly put lives and property at risk, Commissioner McCabe said. The Spring Hill fire burned for a month, closed roads and required extensive resources to keep the public safe. Thankfully, there were no injuries or personal property damage during the fire, but thousands of acres of the publics natural resources were needlessly destroyed. We thank all our partners who helped with fire suppression and the investigation that followed. Everyone can help prevent wildfires by following common-sense guideline, but those who recklessly endanger themselves, others, and our environment should beware that they will be held responsible.</p><p>The Spring Hill fire started on a day when weather conditions were conducive to wildfire risk and spread. Peak wildfire season in New Jersey typically is from late March through early May. During that time, fallen leaves, branches and twigs are abundant, daylength increases, humidity can be low, and it is often warm and windy. Those weather conditions combined with lack of new leaf growth makes forest debris more susceptible to the drying effects of wind and sun, particularly in the Pinelands region of the state. The dry underbrush acts as kindling for wildfire growth.</p><p>While most wildfires are caused by people, other factors can also increase wildfire risk. A lightning strike was determined to have caused the Split Ditch wildfire at the Millville Wildlife Management Area on April 9. The Forest Fire Service deemed the 1,518-acre fire under control on April 11.</p><p>The Pinelands ecosystem, which covers a large swath of southern New Jersey including the area of the Spring Hill wildfire -- is especially vulnerable to wildfires because its predominant tree and shrub species are particularly flammable. In addition, this region tends to dry out quickly after rainfall because of its porous and sandy soils.</p><p>That was the case with the Spring Hill wildfire on March 30, 2019, which resulted when embers from an illegal bonfire on private property escaped and set a nearby forest ablaze. Weather conditions fueled the spread.</p><p>Now as New Jersey approaches peak wildfire season again, the Spring Hill blaze that charred thousands of acres of forest, closed a major highway, required hundreds of firefighters and thousands of dollars to suppress, is a stark reminder of the potential for large and catastrophic wildfire in the state.</p><p>Nearly all wildfires are caused by people, through accidents, carelessness, negligence and even arson, State Firewarden and Forest Fire Service Chief Gregory S. McLaughlin said. Reducing those risks is especially critical at this time of year, when weather conditions and other factors can increase wildfire risk. The painstaking investigation of the Spring Hill wildfire over the past year highlights why human behavior is a critical factor in preventing wildfires.</p><p>It is especially important that the public be extra vigilant while outside at this time of year in order to prevent accidents that can quickly lead to a wildfire, said Ray Bukowski, Assistant Commissioner for Natural and Historic Resources.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service works to prevent wildfires year-round through public outreach and education efforts, maintenance of fire breaks and prescribed burning. In addition, the Forest Fire Service uses a network of strategically placed fire towers staffed by trained observers to pinpoint fires and direct resources to them as quickly as possible. The Forest Fire Service also maintains a system of automated weather stations to monitor localized conditions.</p><p>Most wildfires are preventable, and the public should follow these guidelines:</p><p>Dont discard cigarettes, matches and smoking materials on the ground.</p><p>Obtain required permits for campfires from your nearest Forest Fire Service office. Dont leave fires unattended and be sure to douse them completely, until cold to the touch.</p><p>Keep matches and lighters away from children. Teach youth about fire safety.</p><p>Protect structures from wildfire damage by creating space of at least 30 feet between homes and flammable vegetation in forested or wooded areas, and 100 feet from homes in the Pinelands region. These buffers should be free from vegetation that will burn easily, such as fallen leaves, pine needles, twigs and branches. Make sure firetrucks can access driveways.</p><p>Report suspicious vehicles and individuals to authorities.</p><p>Use wood stoves and fireplaces carefully, since both can emit embers that spark fires. Fully douse ashes with water before disposal.</p><p>Another key component of wildfire control and ensuring ecosystem health is prescribed burning. This past winter and early spring, the Forest Fire Service completed a successful prescribed burning program that will help in managing risk this forest fire season. Using fire as a tool in a thoughtfully planned and controlled manner reduces risk and removes fuels that could contribute to wildfire start and spread. It also keeps forests healthy and provides strategic areas for firefighters to manage wildfires during an incident.</p><p>For more information about the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, wildfire safety, prevention, tips on protecting your home, current conditions and a list of contact numbers for regional Forest Fire Service offices, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.njwildfire.org\">www.njwildfire.org</url>.</p><p>To find your local Forest Fire Service office, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/contactus.html\">www.nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/fire/contactus.html</url>.</p><p>For the current fire danger in New Jersey, visit</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://njparksandforests.org/fire/firedanger-restrictions.htm\">https://njparksandforests.org/fire/firedanger-restrictions.htm</url>.</p><p>To sign up for wildfire or prescribed burning email and text message alerts, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.AlertMeDEP.nj.gov\">www.AlertMeDEP.nj.gov</url>.</p><p>Follow the DEP on Twitter @NewJerseyDEP.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123630556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YP2-FR21-DYTH-G083-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The details are as follows:-</p><p>The Ministry has issued Wood Based Industries (Establishment and Regulation) Guidelines, 2016 and amendment dated 11th September 2017 to decentralize the regulatory processes concerning the wood based industries for the development of the sector in the country.</p><p>To promote cultivation of bamboo in non-forest areas and to achieve the objective of increasing the income of farmers and green cover outside forest area, the Ministry has amended the Indian Forest Act, 1927 to exempt Bamboo grown in non- forest area from definition of tree, and thereby doing away with the requirement of felling/transit permit for its transport and economic use.</p><p>For seamless movement of timber, bamboo and other minor forest produce, the Ministry has also launched National Transit Pass System on pilot basis for issue of online transit permits. This system will help in monitoring and keeping records of movement of timber and issue of transit permits for inter-state and intra-state transportation of timber and bamboo and other minor forest produce from private lands/ government/private depot.</p><p>The Ministry has developed web based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications PARIVESH portal (Pro-Active and Responsive facilitation by Interactive Virtuous and Environmental Single-window Hub), which is a single-window integrated forest and environmental management system for online submission and monitoring of the proposals submitted by the proponents for seeking Environment, Forest, Wildlife and Coastal Regulation Zone clearances from Central Government. It is a GIS based system and analytics platform that provides information to various stakeholders using Decision Support System functionality.</p><p>Further, e-Green Watch portal of the Ministry is an advanced technology based platform designed to facilitate automation, streamlining and effective management of processes related to plantations and other forestry works taken up under CAMPA fund.

The policy would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing large buildings by approximately 325,000 metric tons by 2050 a 27% decrease in building related emissions from a 2008 baseline or the equivalent of taking 72,322 gasoline-powered cars off the road for a year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Building Emissions Performance Standards (BEPS) policy continues Seattle's leadership on climate action and represents a milestone for our city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build healthy communities,\" said Mayor Bruce Harrell. \"This bold legislation will not only create cleaner buildings for people to live, work, and play in, but also hundreds of local jobs and build pathways to careers in the green economy. I'm grateful to the Office of Sustainability and the Environment, Councilmember Herbold, and the broad coalition of environmental advocates, building owners, labor partners, affordable housing providers, and more who were involved in advancing this ambitious policy, representing our collective One Seattle commitment to a sustainable, more climate resilient future for our city.\"</p><p>The City of Seattle received input from hundreds of people during the process of developing the legislation, including residents, workers, community-based organizations, nonprofits, building owners and managers, tenants, labor representatives, environmental justice groups, affordable housing providers, and more, over nearly two years of meetings, open houses, webinars, advisory group and specialized task force sessions. The legislation was unanimously supported by City Council, in the Council's Select Committee on Climate Action.</p><p>Councilmember Lisa Herbold (District 1, West Seattle and South Park) said, \"Addressing greenhouse gas emissions is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Future generations will look back to this moment and judge us by what we did today to address our climate crisis. We experience the impacts here in Seattle: extreme heat, drought, and forest fire haze during the summer and even autumn has become normal. It's time for us to take big swings and make sure we're doing everything we can for ourselves and for all future generations of Seattleites. I'm proud to have had the opportunity to answer the call from Mayor Harrell, the Office of Sustainability and Environment, and advocates to sponsor and shepherd this legislation through the Council in our last weeks of 2023.\"</p><p>\"350 Seattle is delighted by the Committee for Climate Action's decision to pass the Building Emissions Performance Standard,\" said Shemona Moreno, Executive Director. \"We hope it sets a precedent for future Green New Deal policies and appreciate the hard work and thoughtful partnership from the Seattle Office of Sustainability and Environment. We need more climate policies like the BEPS; policies that meet Seattle's climate goals while creating more green jobs, fostering climate resilience, affordable housing and transportation.\"</p><p>The Building Emissions Performance Standard Policy (BEPS) applies to existing nonresidential and multifamily buildings greater than 20,000 square feet. Key policy details include:</p><p>BEPS sets carbon-emissions targets for buildings that become progressively lower in five-year intervals until reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>Compliance starts with reporting requirements by 2027 that quantify building emissions, followed by requirements to meet emissions targets by 2031 (for the largest buildings).</p><p>The BEPS policy has flexible compliance pathways to accommodate buildings of many uses, size, type, ownership, age, and systems, with low-income housing and human services given a longer lead time to prepare.</p><p>With the passage of this legislation, the City's Office of Sustainability and Environment (OSE) will next conduct the required public process to develop the Director's Rule, which will provide detailed compliance guidance for building owners. OSE expects this process to kick-off in Q2 2024 and wrap in 2025. OSE will concurrently issue early guidance to owners on how to estimate their building's existing emissions and future emissions targets, so that they can use this information to plan and implement emissions reduction projects.</p><p>\"BEPS is one of the most impactful climate actions we can take to reduce emissions and is the result of years of collaboration with stakeholders across labor, affordable housing, environmental sectors, and more,\" said Jessyn Farrell, Director of the Office of Sustainability and Environment. \"With Mayor Harrell's leadership and Council's support, we are now one step closer toward creating a cleaner, healthier City for us all and look forward to working with and supporting building owners in this transition.\"</p><p>Building owners and operators are also encouraged to check out the Seattle Clean Buildings Accelerator program which provides technical support and funding for upgrades and register for upcoming info sessions. Mayor Harrell included $4.5M per year to support the Accelerator program in the 2024 proposed budget for engineering and capital investments, prioritized for buildings in or serving frontline communities, as well as an additional $530,000 for BEPS implementation.</p><p>This legislation was called for both in the City's 2013 Climate Action plan and more recently in Mayor Harrell's Downtown Activation Plan. The BEPS policy was developed to maximize benefits to building owners and tenants and to ensure equitable pathways to high quality green jobs, especially for people of color and women. The policy is forecasted to create hundreds of local jobs that cannot be outsourced and will support workers directly in the Seattle area.</p><p>What People Are Saying:</p><p>Councilmember Dan Strauss (District 6 Northwest Seattle)</p><p>\"Growing up in Seattle, I watched as our summers became hotter, our skies smokier, and our weather less predictable. Inaction is not an option, and we must urgently combat one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, the buildings we work and live in. We already passed the strongest energy code in the nation to make new buildings more efficient and now, with this policy, we will ensure the buildings already built help address the climate crisis too.\"</p><p>Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda (Position 8 Citywide)</p><p>\"Passing this legislation is one of the most important steps the City can take right now to tackle our local climate emissions. Paired with the record investments we are making with Jumpstart Green New Deal funding to shore up the resilience of our local communities and workforce, this policy will strengthen the City's climate response and show strong leadership on local climate action. While there's still so much left to do to advance climate justice, today we should all celebrate passage of this landmark policy. Thank you to the Office of Sustainability and Environment, MLK Labor and Seattle's building trades, affordable housing advocates and providers, and the climate advocates whose years of advocacy and collaboration made this possible.\"</p><p>Deepa Sivarajan, Washington Local Policy Manager, Climate Solutions</p><p>\"Buildings are still the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington, and burning fossil fuels inside our homes and buildings pollutes our indoor air and harms public health. Seattle's new Building Emissions Performance Standard will ensure Seattle's largest existing buildings transition to being fully powered by clean energy over the next few decades. This policy will help put Seattle on track to meeting its climate targets while also protecting the health and safety of our communities, reducing air pollution, and increasing the use of heat pumps that provide both heating and air conditioning. We're very pleased to have worked with the City on making the policy more equitable, effective, and enforceable, and look forward to continuing this work in the coming years.\"</p><p>Dylan Plummer, Senior Campaign Representative, Sierra Club</p><p>\"To protect public health and mitigate the worst impacts of the climate crisis, Seattle must transition off of fossil fuels like polluting fracked gas. Developing strong and enforceable Building Emissions Performance Standards and requiring large buildings to make the switch from dirty fuels is a critical step to protect our climate and reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution and will offer a model for other cities in the region to follow.\"</p><p>Katie Garrow, Executive Secretary-Treasurer, MLK Labor (AFL-CIO)</p><p>\"Climate change has reached Seattle in the form of wildfire smoke and heatwaves and this policy is part of the solution. Mayor Harrell's Building Performance Standards policy is forecasted to create thousands of jobs over its lifespan which will benefit Seattle-area workers and expand career pathways for women and workers of color.\"</p><p>Debolina Banerjee, Green New Deal Oversight Board Executive Committee Member</p><p>\"The Building Emissions Performance Standard is a great opportunity to advance Seattle's Green New Deal by addressing one of the city's largest sources of emissions while creating green union jobs and expanding strategies to support climate resilience for people across Seattle. Equitable implementation and ensuring no communities are left behind in Seattle's clean energy transition is essential. We look forward to working with the Mayor, City Council, and community partners in the coming years to ensure BEPS plays a key role in Seattle's Just Transition.\"</p><p>Patience Malaba, Executive Director, Housing Development Consortium</p><p>\"Affordable housing is critical, as is solving our ever-growing climate crisis. Today, through Mayor Harrell's leadership, we will start making meaningful reductions in the climate pollution that, sadly, impacts our most vulnerable communities in Seattle first and worst. We will, at the same time, ensure that we are creating more resilient housing for Seattle's residents far into the future. This is one of those rare moments when we can celebrate a giant policy leap forward that addresses the intersecting crises of affordable housing, racial equity, and climate change. I am proud of the work we did together to ensure that the Building Emissions Performance Standard works for affordable housing providers and the broader ecosystem.\"</p><p>Rachel Koller, Managing Director, Shift Zero</p><p>\"Buildings must be part of the climate solution and Seattle's Building Emissions Performance Standards is a key strategy, guiding the city's largest buildings on a path to clean, efficient electric systems as they upgrade over the coming years. The resulting clean energy retrofits will make a difference in day-to-day lives, by expanding access to heat pumps for cooling in the face of heat events and wildfire smoke that are now familiar in our region.\"</p><p>Nancy Hirsh, Executive Director, NW Energy Coalition</p><p>\"This Building Performance Standard is vital to helping Seattle achieve its climate, clean energy, and economic goals. Building retrofits require planning and investment, and this proposal provides both. Large commercial and multifamily building owners will be able to access funding and incentives for clean energy retrofits from the Federal Inflation Reduction Act, state and local programs to decarbonize their buildings in the coming years, creating healthier living and working spaces.\"</p><p>Laura Jay, C40 Cities Regional Director for North America</p><p>\"Seattle's bold action to adopt a Building Energy Performance Standard sets a powerful example of what climate leadership looks like. With the proposed building standards, Seattle will join C40 Cities like New York, Boston, and Washington DC in charting a path forward for cities to reduce emissions from buildings, create good green jobs, and keep residents safe and healthy. C40 commends Seattle and Mayor Harrell and looks forward to the greener future enabled by this milestone achievement.\"</p><p>Jonny Kocher, Manager, Carbon-Free Buildings Program, RMI</p><p>\"The Seattle Building Emissions Performance Standard positions the city among national leaders in reducing emissions from existing buildingsa crucial step to confronting the climate crisis and delivering health and economic benefits for families and businesses. RMI applauds Mayor Harrell for proposing this new standard and we look forward to supporting this strong policy that prioritizes housing equity, climate justice, and energy savings for its most vulnerable residents.\"</p><p>Simone Mangili, Executive Director, Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance</p><p>\"Congratulations Mayor Harrell for this groundbreaking achievement. Seattle's collaborative approach, working closely with the building industry and environmental community to deliver the kind of impactful policy that the climate crisis requires, is a model for other cities.\"</p><p>Jessica Miller, Senior Director of Policy Strategy &amp; Engagement, IMT</p><p>\"Seattle's law marks a significant step towards aligning with major US cities like Boston, St. Louis, New York, and Washington DC. This strategic move not only integrates Seattle into a national effort but also enhances its potential to obtain crucial federal funding for equitable implementation. The impact of building performance standards extends beyond buildings; it offers substantial benefits for residents and the climate.\"</p><p>Neil Bavins, Principal, Windward Consulting NW</p><p>\"This is important and challenging legislation. As a member of the Technical Advisory Group, it feels like our concerns were heard and addressed. The City did a great job of listening to stakeholders and crafting a standard that is simple to understand and will be effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings.\"</p><p>Michelle Pion, SAFE Cities Senior Organizer, STAND.earth</p><p>\"Fossil fuel use in buildings is one of the biggest contributors to the pollution that causes climate change. Seattle has helped to lead the way in Washington on reducing pollution in new construction and we're encouraged to see them moving forward with a proposal to reduce pollution from existing buildings. This is a step in the right direction, and we hope this policy can help accelerate related efforts. A win in Seattle sets a template for cities across the country to do the same.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126295564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69W2-3XM1-DYTH-G437-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 13, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from Moscow, Idaho, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Climate change has intensified the scale of global wildfire impacts in recent decades. In order to reduce fire impacts, management policies are being proposed in the western United States to lower fire risk that focus on harvesting trees, including large-diameter trees.\"</p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Science Foundation; National Institute of Food And Agriculture; Bureau of Indian Affairs.<br/> The news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Idaho: \"Many policies already do not include diameter limits and some recent policies have proposed diameter increases in fuel reduction strategies. While the primary goal is fire risk reduction, these policies have been interpreted as strategies that can be used to save trees from being killed by fire, thus preventing carbon emissions and feedbacks to climate warming. This interpretation has already resulted in cutting down trees that likely would have survived fire, resulting in forest carbon losses that are greater than if a wildfire had occurred. To help policymakers and managers avoid these unintended carbon consequences and to present carbon emission sources in the same context, we calculate western United States forest fire carbon emissions and compare them with harvest and fossil fuel emissions (FFE) over the same timeframe. We find that forest fire carbon emissions are on average only 6% of anthropogenic FFE over the past decade. While wildfire occurrence and area burned have increased over the last three decades, per area fire emissions for extreme fire events are relatively constant. In contrast, harvest of mature trees releases a higher density of carbon emissions (e.g., per unit area) relative to wildfire (150-800%) because harvest causes a higher rate of tree mortality than wildfire. Our results show that increasing harvest of mature trees to save them from fire increases emissions rather than preventing them.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Shown in context, our results demonstrate that reducing FFEs will do more for climate mitigation potential (and subsequent reduction of fire) than increasing extractive harvest to prevent fire emissions. On public lands, management aimed at less-intensive fuels reduction (such as removal of 'ladder' fuels, i.e., shrubs and small-diameter trees) will help to balance reducing catastrophic fire and leave live mature trees on the landscape to continue carbon uptake.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Carbon Emission Sources Are Not Equal: Putting Fire, Harvest, and Fossil Fuel Emissions in Context. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</emphasis>, 2022,5.

Dozens of complaints about air quality and smoke   have poured into state and local agencies.Local NPR station <url normalizedValue=\"https://wbhm.org/2022/officials-see-hurdles-to-putting-out-landfill-fire-near-moody-as-neighbors-suffer/\">WBHM reported</url> about the numerous violations the Moody Landfill has received over a five-year time span. </p><p>According to the outlet, the ADEM found illegal waste such   as scrap tires, appliances, shingles and demolition materials at the site in 2017.   Inspectors also discovered large amounts of yard waste and \"other unauthorized waste like 'medical or infectious waste, industrial wastes, or hazardous waste.'\" One memo from a decade ago spoke about the potential for fires at the site. Violations were issues in 2013 and 2017.   As a response, the landowner's family put up signs about the type of waste that is allowed at the landfill and said they had diverted the waste to another site. A recent inspection in 2020 showed that was not the case. Moody Landfill was last inspected in August 2022, and the ADEM once again found construction and demolition waste piled on top of yard waste.In a statement made on Facebook on December 28,   EMA Director Patrice Kurzejeski posted:St Clair County EMA and your County Commissioner Chairman, Stan Batemon, have visited the site many times. St Clair County does realize and empathize with you and your family concerning your living conditions. Please know efforts from your local County Commission, State Senator/Representative, and Federal Senators/Representatives to identify a solution to this fire have not ceased. We have been working on this since the first day it was apparent that the landfill would continue to burn. I am sure you have heard our hands were tied due to the landfill being private property. But, with the continued push from your elected officials, we may be closer to a resolution very soon. Please continue to monitor social media and local news for updates.The ADEM announced it was working in conjunction with firefighting personnel including the Moody Fire Department and the Alabama Forestry Commission such as the Alabama Emergency Management Agency and the St. Clair County Emergency Management Agency.   Officials likened the underground blaze to the one in Centralia, Pa., a coal town that has largely been abandoned after a fire began in a coal mine beneath the area since 1962.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASTEA-687542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASTEA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:677P-M731-JBKS-P2XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">255491</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Informa Business Media, Inc.

Now, the nation's Supreme Court must decide if Khan's conviction should also be overturned.</p><p>On Aug. 5, Khan was found guilty of concealing assets obtained from selling state gifts given to him by foreign leaders while in office. Pakistan's Election Commission proceeded to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/international/pakistan-election-commission-disqualifies-imran-khan-for-5-years-what-does-that-mean-for-his-political-career--news-309215\">disqualify</url>  Khan from seeking office for five years because, under Pakistani law, no convicted person is eligible to lead a party, run in elections, or hold public office. That meant Khan could not run in Pakistan's upcoming parliamentary elections, which were set to take place later this year but are now likely to be delayed.</p><p>If Pakistan's Supreme Court follows Tuesday's appellate court ruling and throws out his conviction, then Khan will be eligible to run for reelection. However, despite the Supreme Court having not decided anything yet, Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/29/pakistan-court-suspends-imran-khans-conviction-in-big-relief-for-ex-pm\">deemed</url>  the suspension of his sentencing a win for democracy.</p><p>But Khan is not out of legal hot water yet. The former leader faces more than 100 cases against him, including charges of abetment to murder, orchestrating violent protests, and leaking state secrets. The Islamabad High Court <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-ex-pm-imran-khans-graft-conviction-suspended-geo-tv-2023-08-29/\">granted</url>  Khan bail on Tuesday\u2014but instead of releasing him, the court ordered jail authorities to keep him locked up so that on Wednesday, Khan can face charges on a completely different case.</p><p>In this one, authorities allege Khan publicized the contents of a confidential cable sent by Pakistan's ambassador to the United States as a means to try to prove that Washington was behind his ouster. Islamabad's Parliament ousted Khan in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, something Khan has gone on to accuse the United States and the Pakistani military of orchestrating. Both have denied these allegations. If Khan is convicted of leaking classified documents later this week, it doesn't matter what the country's Supreme Court decides in the first case; Khan will still not be eligible to run for office.</p><p>'[A]rresting him in any other case will cause further damage to our national integrity and repute of judicial system,' Zulfi Bukhari, Khan's former aide, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/sayedzbukhari/status/1696437498656743540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">wrote</url>  on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Gen.

The push to secure new military hardware is part of the Pentagon's efforts to adapt to threats of artificial intelligence and become less 'risk-averse' when it comes to adopting new technologies, said U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks. These weapons will be less expensive, easier to build, and more expendable.</p><p>The move comes amid U.S. Commerce Secretary <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/08/28/china-us-trade-raimondo-wang-engagement-decoupling-working-group-semiconductor/\">Gina Raimondo's trip</url>  to the mainland to discuss establishing closer business ties as well as increasing <url normalizedValue=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/31/energy-taiwan-semiconductor-chips-china-tsmc/\">Chinese aggression</url>  toward Taiwan, which Beijing deems part of its sovereign territory.

Need I say more? I will. <br/>The bulk of the trauma experienced as 'climate' in this research was the 2018 California Camp Fire, a devastating blaze that killed 85 people and burned down thousands of structures, including homes and businesses. It was a wholly unique and terrifying event. The idea that people who survived it might have post-traumatic stress is like suggesting people a majority of those surveyed were less thirsty after drinking a tall, cool glass of water. <br/>The reporting suggests that traumatic weather events resulting from Climate Change created PTSD-like symptoms and that mental health experts must be prepared to help the survivors. <br/>The California Camp Fire was the result of political negligence and progressive priorities[2]. It was started by an agin transmission line and spread by typical California winds in a state with a history of land-management neglect, especially forestland[3]. <br/>It was a Liberal-man-caused disaster and not the result of a warming planet or any other Climate Cult myth. <br/>To be clear, the trauma is real, and some folks will carry that around their entire life. Some of them may need support. And yes, people have been traumatized by severe weather for as long as humans have tried to live on a planet that has it. It's not new. It will always result in stress. Though I'd argue equally for that, there is significant unjustified stress created by false or incomplete narratives about things like climate (or COVID) which contribute. <br/>The non-stop harassment of regular citizens creates plenty of stress, which is justified by events like the Camp fire or natural earthly weather. <br/>It's gaslighting. <br/>A more accurate survey would examine the mental stress caused by excessive regulation and taxation - especially in California - resulting from the progressive obsession with using climate to launder tax dollars into certain people's pockets. We could use call it Post Tax-Bill Stress Disorder PTSD). A genuine and complicated mental health threat with vectors from every level of government. <br/><br/>The study was published in PLOS Climate.

Orange hazy smoke seen against Atlanta skyline.</p><p>Jul 19, 2023</p><p>Atlanta, GA</p><p>Atlanta is seeing some of the worst air quality in the nation, and the culprit is actually thousands of miles away.</p><p>More than 900 wildfires blazing in Canada are creating smoke and dust particles that are being carried by the jet stream all the way down to the Deep South. Georgia Tech scientists and researchers are watching closely.</p><p>Wildfires themselves aren't uncommon. But what is unordinary and, at times, dangerous is the number of particles in the air.</p><p>\"It is unusual to experience high concentrations of smoke aerosols within the contiguous U.S. such as what we have been observing recently,\" said Zachary Handlos, meteorologist and Senior Academic Professional within the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Tech.</p><p>The Federal Government, via AirNow.gov, updates air quality data in real time. This map from Tuesday shows dangerous levels of fine particulates in the air around Atlanta.</p><p>Fine particulate matter (also known as PM2.5) levels exceeded 55 micrograms per cubic meter of air south of Atlanta. This is the reason for the recent air quality alerts, which indicated that the air quality in metro Atlanta sat in the orange zone Monday and Tuesday, meaning the air has been potentially hazardous for the most at-risk people.</p><p>Older persons, pregnant women, young children and anyone with preexisting health conditions are among the most vulnerable populations. However, anyone can technically be affected by poor air conditions.</p><p>PM2.5 is fine enough to penetrate deep into the lungs,\" said Talat Odman, principal research engineer and air quality expert from the Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p><p>Older persons, pregnant women, young children and anyone with preexisting health conditions are among the most vulnerable populations. However, anyone can technically be affected by poor air conditions.</p><p>Both Odman and Handlos say an N95 mask can be a big help in filtering out this particulate matter.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wildfire smoke is dangerous because it contains higher levels of dangerous particles that can irritate the eyes, invade and harm the respiratory system, and worsen existing heart and lung diseases.</p><p>Handlos explained that there's a specific weather pattern helping to create the conditions necessary for all this smoke to travel such far distances.</p><p>\"Within the past few days, a large-scale trough feature in the upper troposphere moved through the Eastern U.S., which has led to a shift in upper-level winds out of the Northwest,\" he said. \"This allows for the transport of smoke from Southwestern Canada southeastward all the way into our region.\"</p><p>This same weather pattern has been bringing the smoke from these Canadian wildfires to other cities across the U.S. including Minneapolis, Washington D.C., and New York. This week has been the first time the smoke has made it so far south.</p><p>We see this same type of atmospheric conditions during other parts of the year in Atlanta.</p><p>\" Remember the freezing temperatures in Atlanta back in December?\" asked Odman. \"Similar to those days when air masses coming from Canada brought extremely cold temperatures here, they are bringing smoke from wildfires in Canada now.</p><p>This map from colleagues at the University of Wisconsin shows how wind flow and speed from the Jet Stream can carry smoke from Canada thousands of miles south towards Atlanta.</p><p>As Handlos explains, the summer heat and climate change are only working to complicate an already tenuous atmospheric environment.</p><p>Aerosols, like the smoke from a wildfire or from synthetic air pollutants, serve as surfaces to which water vapor molecules can attach. These tiny cloud droplets suspend in the air and create the hazy conditions that have been occurring in Atlanta.</p><p>\"With global climate change, regions experiencing an increase in temperature could become more susceptible to increased ozone concentration, a pollutant common in cities, as well as smoke blown in by wildfires, which are expected to occur more frequently,\" said Handlos.</p><p>Warmer regions are also seeing less rainfall, which puts them at greater risk for wildfires, perpetuating the cycle. This means regions with poor air quality may observe even worse air quality as a result.</p><p>Handlos says climate change models only seem to point to an increased probability of heat waves or warmer-than-average conditions. While the current situation is due to the Canadian wildfires, Handlos says wildfires are generally likely to happen more often due to global climate change.</p><p>\" There is an increase in the frequency and severity of fire events throughout the world. We should expect more events like this when smoke from fires in western US and Canada pollute the air in Atlanta,\" Odman concurred.</p><p>But can anything be done to make the situation better? The answer is complicated. Georgia Tech researchers have been working on ways to capture and clean air pollutants and to determine certain days where it may be best to adjust which power plants were operating in specific parts of the state in an effort to control emissions.</p><p>\"There aren't great strategies for eliminating the forest fire haze that reaches Georgia,\" explained Valerie Thomas, Professor in the H. Milton School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Tech.</p><p>But, she says, air pollution created by cars and trucks in major metropolitan areas like Atlanta is only compounded by conditions like the wildfire smoke we've been seeing.</p><p>\"Staying inside and not driving on days with poor air quality will reduce exposure to air pollution and reduce emissions,\" said Thomas.</p><p>As shared by the New York Times from data supplied by the AirNow.gov, Atlanta still the worst air quality in the entire country as of Thursday, July 19.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126030759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RP-7CY1-DYTH-G399-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 19, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It s raised $55 million at a valuation approaching $250 million.</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On oil rigs and at remote mines   not to mention advanced military bases, fire prevention outposts or even at elite surfing competitions   one basic problem slows the easy use of exciting new artificial intelligence models: data. By remote sensor, camera and drone, they re generating it by the terabyte. Then it usually just sits there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Nothing is being done with this data, and that just seemed crazy to me,  Dan Wright, CEO of startup Armada told<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes</emphasis>.  Once I got into the problem of bridging that digital divide, I couldn t help it; I just couldn t stop. </p><p>Armada has spent the past year building what it believes is the solution: a full-stack technology platform that brings AI grade computing capabilities to industrial devices that might benefit from them. A big piece of that: building on top of Elon Musk s SpaceX. While other startups have leveraged SpaceX in their strategies for mining or manufacturing in space, Armada believes it s the first to be built on top of Starlink, SpaceX s network of internet-provider satellites. Its software suite, Commander, includes tools for managing and connecting Starlinks and other internet assets to ensure connectivity in remote areas.</p><p>Armada also offers an app store of its own and others  apps for working with generated data on location (think sensors warning of pending needed maintenance or unexpected visitors at a remote mining site). Then there s the hardware: a weatherized mobile data center in a box called a Galleon that can fit on the back of a flatbed truck, and which can house racks of GPUs, or graphics processing units, crucial to running AI models.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>  We need more companies to try to solve problems where, if the tech works and the company is successful, the world is a better place for it.  &lt;footer&gt;Armada CEO Dan Wright&lt;/footer&gt;</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>While startups like OpenAI and Anthropic have raised billions of dollars in a race to build bigger and more powerful AI models, Armada is one of the most promising of another wave of startups looking to unlock their capabilities for business uses far from Silicon Valley or an Amazon Web Services data center. Cofounded with Jon Runyan last December, Armada already employs 60 people in the Bay Area and Seattle, where it s hiring away from the cloud and AI staff at cloud heavyweights Amazon and Microsoft.</p><p>Armada has no customers beyond a proof-of-concept trial, meaning its revenue remains at zero so far. But investors are bullish about its opportunities in energy, manufacturing and mining, as well as defense. In January, venture capital firms Founders Fund, Lux Capital and Shield Capital led a $15 million seed round into Armada that valued the company at more than $50 million. Last month, Armada raised an additional $40 million in a Series A funding round led by return investor 8090 Industries that included those funds as well as new investors Felicis, Contrary Capital, Marlinspike Partners, Valor and Koch Industries.</p><p>Armada s valuation is now already approaching $250 million after the funding, a source with knowledge told<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes</emphasis>. Armada declined to comment on its valuation.</p><p>And with ambitions to score contracts with the world s largest industrial players and the U.S. Department of Defense, Armada represents a high-difficulty, high-upside new act for Wright, who was last seen in the public eye resigning from his previous role as CEO of AI software unicorn DataRobot in July 2022 amid layoffs and an insider trading scandal. Wright declined to comment on that situation beyond a written statement. But with Armada, he believes he s back with technology that can be a major picks-and-shovels provider in delivering real results from the AI boom.</p><p> We need more companies to try to solve problems where, if the tech works and the company is successful, the world is a better place for it,  Wright said.  Hopefully people see Armada and say,  Hey, that was something the world needed.  </p><p>&lt;figure&gt;</p><p>&lt;figcaption&gt;</p><p>A group of SpaceX's Starlink satellites passing over Uruguay in 2021.</p><p>AFP via Getty Images</p><p>&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>Armada got its start at a private conference hosted by a major SpaceX investor, 137 Ventures, in Park City, Utah in November 2022. One of the firm s partners had been tinkering with possible business uses for Starlink, even taking out several patents. But SpaceX,<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reportedly</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>expected to be valued at $175 billion in the private market, had other priorities than building a software stack on top of its satellites, or getting into a new hardware product line. With the blessing of on-site executives, the firm approached Wright, a free agent after the DataRobot<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>controversy</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>a few months before.</p><p>A lawyer by training   he worked with cofounder Runyan at a Bay Area law firm serving startups more than a decade ago   Wright was general counsel at app performance manager AppDynamics when, two days before it was scheduled to go public in January 2017, it was acquired in a<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>shock move</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>by Cisco for $3.7 billion. Wright had been promoted to chief operating office before leaving for DataRobot in 2020, where he became CEO the following March. Runyan, meanwhile, was coming off a long stint as general counsel of access manager Okta, including during its 2017 IPO.</p><p>For what could prove to be a capital intensive, complicated business with multiple products and large-sized target customers that aren t used to working with startups, Wright and Runyan seemed ideal founders, investors said, their networks more than making up for a lack of deep AI research chops, or direct hardware experience. As technical leaders, they d quickly brought in CTO Pradeep Nair, a former vice president of engineering at VMware and Microsoft s Azure cloud division, and chief AI officer Prag Mishra, who had been leading AI and machine learning for Amazon s health unit and previously been a research lead at Microsoft.</p><p> It seemed like the right time and the right team,  said Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens.  A lot of times these really complicated tech problems end up being overvalued, and the business side of the equation gets undervalued. Armada has a great deal of competence in both. </p><p>And investors were unfazed by Wright s exit at DataRobot, where he and other executives resigned following a<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>report</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>of insider stock sales made by the executives, including Wright, that had not been made available to rank-and-file staff.</p><p> People that were involved came out saying they had a desire to work with Dan again, so that ultimately was a very positive signal for me,  said Lux general partner Shahin Farshchi.  There wasn t anything from that experience that would give me less confidence in Dan s ability to pull this off, his ethics and his moral compass in doing so,  added Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens.</p><p>Wright declined to answer specific<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes </emphasis>questions about his DataRobot tenure.  My track record of helping build successful technology companies speaks for itself,  he said in a written statement.  I look forward to continuing to support DataRobot s current leadership [in] any way I can and applying the lessons I learned there and at AppDynamics toward building a generational company at Armada with our incredible team. </p><p>&lt;figure&gt;</p><p>&lt;figcaption&gt;</p><p>An Armada Galleon close-up.</p><p>Armada</p><p>&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p><p>Made out of multiple layers of interior lining and and a reinforced outer casing of military-grade heavy gauge steel, a Galleon can fit on the back of a truck or rail car for its journey to a far flung location; there on a trailer or level ground, it can be up-and-running within 48 hours. The real value, however, is what s inside: in the standard 40 ft. Galleon, six racks of computer processing units, or CPUs, or GPUs; in a 20 ft. version, the housing for three.</p><p>Armada has a Galleon up and running at its Seattle offices, where it runs a number of AI applications in demos, but for now, it s unclear how many are active in the wild. Asked to connect<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forbes</emphasis>to customers, Armada introduced Nexa Resources, a publicly-traded mining company currently conducting a proof-of-concept trial, CIO Marcelo Alves Santos said by email. Setting up remote data centers at mines could otherwise take as long as eight months, according to Santos.  Collaborating with Armada offers the prospect of more efficient, quicker and adaptable operations, a significant step up from our current capabilities,  he said. But Armada later clarified that Nexa isn t currently operating any Galleons in the field.</p><p>A further-along trial is happening at a well-known media company, whose executive in charge asked to remain anonymous because he wasn t authorized to speak in an official capacity. There, Armada s Commander software suite, and specifically its Connect software for managing Starlink satellite usage, is proving the difference between the SpaceX satellites serving as a primary source of internet connectivity for streaming live events. By bonding up to seven Starlink terminals (on-ground receivers working with the satellites) together as one, the media company can ensure a high bandwidth baseline it couldn t by working with SpaceX alone, the person said.</p><p> If you re on the tip of Africa, that s a lot of data to be sending back to an East Coast Amazon data center,  the person said.  We can get richer content at a lower footprint. </p><p>SpaceX did not respond to a comment request. Armada called its relationship with SpaceX a  close collaboration  but declined to answer specific questions.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>  This has been the bane of our existence: we deployed a lot of great assets, but now there isn t enough bandwidth to do things.  &lt;footer&gt;Vice Admiral David Dunaway (USN, Ret.)&lt;/footer&gt;</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p>That media company is also exploring the use of Armada s other software, specifically a group of AI apps called EdgeAI. Products within the EdgeAI suite include a tool that can automatically detect and analyze motion in streaming video; another can process real-time automated narration. Handling such tasks at their source could allow an event streamer to run more local calculations, such as measuring the size of a wave or distance of a launch, and help identify the best camera angles to be sending back.</p><p>Other apps from inside Armada and through partners can have more industrial value, like filling out information forms required by regulators, or making maintenance suggestions before there is an emergency, the company said. At least one railroad company, which Armada declined to name, is testing the use of its apps to scan and sort containers at a transit hub; Armada also envisions uses in forest fire prevention and other safety uses where sensor data is often only analyzed after an emergency today, Runyan said.</p><p>David Dunaway, a retired vice admiral and the former commander of the Naval Air Systems Command, said he s interested in how Armada s tech can help the military process streaming video to make faster and better decisions, such as knowing whether it s safe to fire on an aerial combat mission. Dunaway is actively advising Armada on its approach to the Department of Defense, where the startup is working to bid for initial contracts.  This has been the bane of our existence: we deployed a lot of great assets, but now there isn t enough bandwidth to do things,  Dunaway said.  Nobody else is putting this kind of compute down-range,  he added, referring to operational areas closer to combat zones.</p><p>Of course, such contracts could take years to procure. Stephens, also the cofounder of Anduril, a defense-focused startup that was<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reportedly</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>seeking a $10 billion valuation in October, noted that Anduril has its own compute capability housed within its autonomous air vehicles. And another past Founders Fund investment, publicly-traded Palantir, already works with customers within the U.S. government and heavy industries to provide AI software. At least one SpaceX investor who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation said they had declined to invest in Armada over concerns its technology would be too easily matched by rivals over time.</p><p>All the more reason for Armada and its founders to announce themselves   and tout their big-business credentials   ahead of a competitive land grab.  You can t come in and just spin out of Stanford and run this kind of company,  claimed Runyan.  Dan and I have been building networks in Silicon Valley for 20 years. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-content_65773a6673e5561ab82fca53</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69VJ-VJH1-DXVP-5193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 11, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000DSM4</classCode><className>STACK INFRASTRUCTURE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS531210 OFFICES OF REAL ESTATE AGENTS &amp;

Just a year ago, \u201cit was always dark, even if the sun was shining, because of all the trees that were here,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said of the grove near his town of San Miguel Topilejo \u2014 on the edge of the encroaching urban sprawl.</p><p>While most people associate Mexico City with traffic jams and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-latin-america-air-pollution-mexico-city-pollution-f9c2e6eeeb6c09594d30c010be775f1a\">polluted air</url>, actually about one-half of the city\u2019s territory is rural, almost all of it in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta and Tlalpan. About 20% are protected nature areas, like the mountains covered with pine and fir forests that adjoin the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Those trees guarantee the recharge of aquifers that supply nearly 20 million people living in the city \u2014 and its suburbs. They also help clean the polluted air of the city and serve to contain high temperatures.</p><p>Why the illegal tree cutting has gotten so bad so fast is a matter of debate.</p><p>Local farm communities \u2014 many of whose members are paid as park rangers or soil conservation workers by the city government \u2014 think that organized crime gangs have moved into the illegal logging business.</p><p>It would not be a far stretch: Such gangs have long used the rural communities on the city\u2019s edge to set up safehouses to hold kidnapping victims and its forests as dumping ground for the bodies of their victims.</p><p>Some of the villagers suggest the federal government\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-mexico-91f8c4eec02e6da3ea5f23de83d45a09\">crackdown on the sale of contraband gasoline and diesel</url> stolen from government pipelines may also play a role, saying those who used to make a living selling fuel at roadside stands may now have turned to logging.</p><p>Mexico City authorities say they have identified criminal groups behind illegal logging, and in the past few months they have struck back, mounting operations involving hundreds of police officers and soldiers who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/massive-raid-illegal-loggers-mexico-city-1b1b10af2806ef7d503f55ada8bf40c4\">raided clandestine sawmills in the mountains</url>.</p><p>The city also sponsors reforestation efforts, but it is a race against time. Many of the tiny saplings won\u2019t survive, and it would take decades to replace the majestic mature forests being cut.</p><p>In 2010, forests covered about 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) of the city\u2019s total area of 370,000 acres (150,000 hectares), according to the activist group Global Forest Watch.</p><p>The group says the city lost 121 acres (49 hectares) of forest in 2022 \u2014 as much as in all of the four previous years together.</p><p>The problem is particularly acute in San Miguel Topilejo, which \u2014 because it has forests and is crossed by highways \u2014 makes it an attractive place for gangs to cut logs and move them to sawmills.</p><p>Pablo Amezcua, a natural resources engineer who works in San Miguel Topilejo, said that before 2020, only about 500 acres (200 hectares) had been affected by logging. Amezcua says that by mid-2023, a total of about 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) had been fully or partially cut.</p><p>Combating illegal loggers is a Sisyphean task.</p><p>According to data from the country's attorney general for environmental protection, there have been 122 illegal logging complaints since 2013 in Mexico City, with more than half of those so far in 2023.</p><p>On a recent day, a group of forest rangers and volunteers set out on a reforestation mission in trucks from San Miguel Topilejo, going down narrow dirt tracks in the forest that are barely wide enough for the small trucks to pass.</p><p>They were escorted by soldiers and armed officers of the National Guard.</p><p>At the wheel of one of the trucks, a 24-year-old looked nervously from side to side as he piloted the vehicle. Like many of the rangers interviewed for this story, he asked not be named citing security reasons.</p><p>He said that when he passed the same spot two days before, there were trees where now there are felled branches and heaps of pine boughs, which could be dangerous fuel in the next forest fire season.</p><p>Riding next to him is a 58-year-old ranger who says he was shot in his abdomen by illegal loggers he tried to stop in November. A year before he says he was forced to flee his community after his family received threats.</p><p>Sadly, his situation is not unusual. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-mexico-colombia-caribbean-brazil-f7f713ef5ee6303506df635d7045418b\">Mexico is the world's deadliest place</url> for environmental and land defense activists, according to a 2022 report by the nongovernmental group Global Witness. Mexico saw 54 activists killed in 2021, the highest number in the world.</p><p>The fact the forests have survived is itself a feat.</p><p>As Mexico City\u2019s population exploded between the 1950s and 1970s, urban sprawl crept steadily up the forested mountain slopes on the city\u2019s southern boroughs. All kinds of logging had already been prohibited but some believe the prohibition fueled illegality.</p><p>Marina Robles, the head of Mexico City\u2019s environment department, said the causes behind illegal logging are many, from real estate interests to organized crime.</p><p>For starters, organized crime gangs that were once content to use the forests as a hide-out and body-dumping ground, now want to control every activity, licit and illicit, that occurs on what they consider \u201ctheir\u201d turf. That includes illegal logging.</p><p>A couple of months ago, local residents \u2014 left to their fate against the gangs \u2014 protested by blocking highways leading out of the forest.</p><p>In response, authorities started the raids in June, with the help of 500 soldiers.</p><p>By early August, acting Mayor Mart\u00ed Batres said authorities have identified al least five organized criminal logging groups in the city and had seized 32 lumber yards and 28 illegal sawmills within city limits. A dozen more sites were found in the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Most were semi-portable, fly-by-night operations.</p><p>\u201cThey find a place that has the right conditions, they set up the sawmills, cut down trees, all very rapidly, from one day to the next; they start milling the logs and then pack up the sawmill,\u201d Batres said.</p><p>He hopes to pass tougher penalties for illegal logging but, at present, it is hard to even arrest illegal loggers, who have attacked rangers and even soldiers, at one point dousing an army patrol with gasoline.</p><p>In return, some local residents set fire to logging trucks.</p><p>But it is an unequal battle.</p><p>\u201cThey have high-powered rifles,\u201d said the ranger who was wounded in November. \u201cThese criminals completely out-gun us.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-39586451a563b4732da11304aae0b8f320230828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691Y-19S1-DYMD-613W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1120\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 28, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Just a year ago, \u201cit was always dark, even if the sun was shining, because of all the trees that were here,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said of the grove near his town of San Miguel Topilejo \u2014 on the edge of the encroaching urban sprawl.</p><p>While most people associate Mexico City with traffic jams and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/mexico-latin-america-air-pollution-mexico-city-pollution-f9c2e6eeeb6c09594d30c010be775f1a\">polluted air</url>, actually about one-half of the city\u2019s territory is rural, almost all of it in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta and Tlalpan. About 20% are protected nature areas, like the mountains covered with pine and fir forests that adjoin the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Those trees guarantee the recharge of aquifers that supply nearly 20 million people living in the city \u2014 and its suburbs. They also help clean the polluted air of the city and serve to contain high temperatures.</p><p>Why the illegal tree cutting has gotten so bad so fast is a matter of debate.</p><p>Local farm communities \u2014 many of whose members are paid as park rangers or soil conservation workers by the city government \u2014 think that organized crime gangs have moved into the illegal logging business.</p><p>It would not be a far stretch: Such gangs have long used the rural communities on the city\u2019s edge to set up safehouses to hold kidnapping victims and its forests as dumping ground for the bodies of their victims.</p><p>Some of the villagers suggest the federal government\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-mexico-91f8c4eec02e6da3ea5f23de83d45a09\">crackdown on the sale of contraband gasoline and diesel</url> stolen from government pipelines may also play a role, saying those who used to make a living selling fuel at roadside stands may now have turned to logging.</p><p>Mexico City authorities say they have identified criminal groups behind illegal logging, and in the past few months they have struck back, mounting operations involving hundreds of police officers and soldiers who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/massive-raid-illegal-loggers-mexico-city-1b1b10af2806ef7d503f55ada8bf40c4\">raided clandestine sawmills in the mountains</url>.</p><p>The city also sponsors reforestation efforts, but it is a race against time. Many of the tiny saplings won\u2019t survive, and it would take decades to replace the majestic mature forests being cut.</p><p>In 2010, forests covered about 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) of the city\u2019s total area of 370,000 acres (150,000 hectares), according to the activist group Global Forest Watch.</p><p>The group says the city lost 121 acres (49 hectares) of forest in 2022 \u2014 as much as in all of the four previous years together.</p><p>The problem is particularly acute in San Miguel Topilejo, which \u2014 because it has forests and is crossed by highways \u2014 makes it an attractive place for gangs to cut logs and move them to sawmills.</p><p>Pablo Amezcua, a natural resources engineer who works in San Miguel Topilejo, said that before 2020, only about 500 acres (200 hectares) had been affected by logging. Amezcua says that by mid-2023, a total of about 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) had been fully or partially cut.</p><p>Combating illegal loggers is a Sisyphean task.</p><p>According to data from the country's attorney general for environmental protection, there have been 122 illegal logging complaints since 2013 in Mexico City, with more than half of those so far in 2023.</p><p>On a recent day, a group of forest rangers and volunteers set out on a reforestation mission in trucks from San Miguel Topilejo, going down narrow dirt tracks in the forest that are barely wide enough for the small trucks to pass.</p><p>They were escorted by soldiers and armed officers of the National Guard.</p><p>At the wheel of one of the trucks, a 24-year-old looked nervously from side to side as he piloted the vehicle. Like many of the rangers interviewed for this story, he asked not be named citing security reasons.</p><p>He said that when he passed the same spot two days before, there were trees where now there are felled branches and heaps of pine boughs, which could be dangerous fuel in the next forest fire season.</p><p>Riding next to him is a 58-year-old ranger who says he was shot in his abdomen by illegal loggers he tried to stop in November. A year before he says he was forced to flee his community after his family received threats.</p><p>Sadly, his situation is not unusual. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-mexico-colombia-caribbean-brazil-f7f713ef5ee6303506df635d7045418b\">Mexico is the world's deadliest place</url> for environmental and land defense activists, according to a 2022 report by the nongovernmental group Global Witness. Mexico saw 54 activists killed in 2021, the highest number in the world.</p><p>The fact the forests have survived is itself a feat.</p><p>As Mexico City\u2019s population exploded between the 1950s and 1970s, urban sprawl crept steadily up the forested mountain slopes on the city\u2019s southern boroughs. All kinds of logging had already been prohibited but some believe the prohibition fueled illegality.</p><p>Marina Robles, the head of Mexico City\u2019s environment department, said the causes behind illegal logging are many, from real estate interests to organized crime.</p><p>For starters, organized crime gangs that were once content to use the forests as a hide-out and body-dumping ground, now want to control every activity, licit and illicit, that occurs on what they consider \u201ctheir\u201d turf. That includes illegal logging.</p><p>A couple of months ago, local residents \u2014 left to their fate against the gangs \u2014 protested by blocking highways leading out of the forest.</p><p>In response, authorities started the raids in June, with the help of 500 soldiers.</p><p>By early August, acting Mayor Mart\u00ed Batres said authorities have identified al least five organized criminal logging groups in the city and had seized 32 lumber yards and 28 illegal sawmills within city limits. A dozen more sites were found in the neighboring state of Morelos.</p><p>Most were semi-portable, fly-by-night operations.</p><p>\u201cThey find a place that has the right conditions, they set up the sawmills, cut down trees, all very rapidly, from one day to the next; they start milling the logs and then pack up the sawmill,\u201d Batres said.</p><p>He hopes to pass tougher penalties for illegal logging but, at present, it is hard to even arrest illegal loggers, who have attacked rangers and even soldiers, at one point dousing an army patrol with gasoline.</p><p>In return, some local residents set fire to logging trucks.</p><p>But it is an unequal battle.</p><p>\u201cThey have high-powered rifles,\u201d said the ranger who was wounded in November. \u201cThese criminals completely out-gun us.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP\u2019s climate coverage at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-39586451a563b4732da11304aae0b8f320230828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691Y-19H1-DYMD-613P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 28, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And I am sure thethat challenge at the world is facing at the moment this is the right place that can engage in innovation , research, directional approach on the focused areas FRI has not only been instrumental in advancing scientific research and technological applications in forestry but also stands as a premier training academy for the officers of the Indian Forest Service and there ones who will catalyse positive situations in Bharat and my foreign friends will be happy to know we are one sixth of the humanity. congratulations to the ministry of environment forest and climate change for facilitating this crucial and impact full event you had the director general and the honorable minister is also very passionate about this he is in a missionary zeal, he is working in overdrive to accomplish what is calling me here today is critical need of the planet, in this country which is home to one sixth of the humanity, we are lucky to living in the times which is Amritkaal, that is my friends abroad can note 75 years of our independence and this Amritkall forest is a Gauravkall there are many aspects where we can take pride in our epochal achievements that is wearing also the issue which you address during last 2 days.</p><p>Honorable Governor indicated about rise of Bharat,India you will re collect just about India was counted as fragile 5 economies that were in some sense burden on the globe where we have come now in 2022 as the Honorable Governor stressed we became the worlds fifth largest global economy in the process we overtook UK and France.</p><p>There are all indications that by turn of the decade by 2030 we world have overtaken the economies of Japan and Germany to be third largest economy of the world. this accomplishment by Bharat India in turn cast on the nation great obligation to secure synergetic response for tackling issues that have been faced by the planet. we have been acknowledged by global outfits including IMF to brightest destination for the investment and opportunities our digital penetration and spread has stunned the world- our digital transactions in 2022 being four times of the US, UK, France and Germany. Our per capita internet data utilisation during 2022 has been more than the combine of US and China. Growth trajectory of Bharat and other nations can be secured only when all on the planet are aware of existential challenges. Growth trajectory of Bharat and other nations can be secured only when all on the planet are aware of existential critical challenges and that is the writing on the wall, may be few decade ago, the issue was not taken seriously but now every one has come to know about the challenge the planet is facing and the draconian consequences it can have, it is heartening a positive development the nations of the world are converging with positive mindsets to find the solution to these problems and the deliberations you have are part of that but friends a brief reference was made by the Honorable Governor for thousand of years our history our civilizational ethos they conversion of one aspect which is in Sanskrit is known as Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam When India got the presidency of the G20 a remarkable vent at a critical time in the history of the planet we have a motto for that and the Moto was we take the world take as one Earth one family one future.</p><p>friends what you addressed what you deliberated what you work to find resolutions is to secure this if the nations of the world can believe this is one Earth one family one future the challenges that are staring us at the faces will not affect an individual nation they will affect planet as such like Covid which was unknown challenge to every part of the globe every part of the society this challenge is for most severe critical then kovid challenge.</p><p>The apt theme for G20 went a long way. I was associated as Vice President and interacted with global leaders. They came out with the Delhi Declaration, I would be making reflections only to the extent it is a quiet for your deliberations, great accomplishment the declaration recognised the importance of collective action in tackling environmental challenges and climate change. Our forests are not merely a resource but also encompass the cultural, spiritual and intellectual heritage of the country Forests are our lungs. Our life line. People dependent on forests have to be nurtured, maintaining balance.</p><p>Forests besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.</p><p>These are much more than reservoirs of biodiversity, they are also the lifeline of millions of our citizens, especially the tribal and forest-dependent communities.</p><p>Friends, It is imperative that we strike a delicate balance between development and conservation, ensuring that our forests continue to thrive while meeting the development requirements of our citizens. Conservation, though critical and crucial, cannot be isolated from the well-being of communities that rely on forest resources.</p><p>Sustainable development and containing climate change are quintessential to a secure future. These challenges in a sense are existential.Forests,covering third of all land on Earth, breathe life into our world. providing us with oxygen, shelter, jobs, water, nourishment and fuel.India is one of the world's most-biodiverse countries and among the few countries that have managed to increase its forest and tree cover, and that too in harmony with rapid growth in the economy.</p><p>Friendsthe people therefore must be like enlightened that forest apart from that all we know out of common sense are the largest store houses of the carbon after the oceans observing greenhouse gases from the air and lock it away above and blow the ground it is no surprise in a scenario like this if we damage forest if we cut forest we release whose amount of carbon emission that contribute to climate crisis we all need to realise that forest are climate solution one of the impactful resolute acceptable solution to climate change forest providers carbon sink carbon Singh that observes up to 2.4 billion metric ton carbon each year can be afford while being the cross roads of these great problems to ignore such a vital impact the forest have been our lives there urgent need and this is specific to world and more specific to my country we must resonate and nurture our ponds and our forest land that is not a large area in every village and small community in India in Africa in South America you will find there will be forest land it will be home to cattle which will take care of several issues this country this is a campaign we have decided there is a significant accomplishment to have 75000 Amritsar over more than 50000 are already in existence the United nation forum on forest if the world has achieved something great we need a global body United nation is unique in performing this task and this particular forum on forest exemplifies the synergy resulting from focus collective actions serving as a beacon of and the platform for nation to come together share knowledge and force partnership to more sustainable future.</p><p>I am sure the delegates who take home several of solutions by our affirmative policies which are providing in Bharat to solve the problem, today deliberations and the themes very thoughtfully selected is a challenge We are stern we are flabbergasted that in spite of the technological advancement we have made how we are suffering forest fires even the most developed nation are unable to find quick solution these theme forest fire wildfire this is very technical it has to be addressed and the resolution found in a multi layer approached Technology being one of them people making people aware is another sustaining forest in the right manner and you would know more about it I am not expert you all here are and the second thing is the forest certification and sustainable forest management nothing can be more critical I said more than a billion people I can say more than population of India ath of the humidity all over the world we have this population life livelihood existence of this people is dependent on the forest and therefore I congratulate the United Nation for human forest.</p><p>The officials of the Government of India for having very imaginatively thought of these two things that are of great contemporaneous relevant not to our country but to the world at large all over the world will find one thing the under privilege and financially weaker section of the community they often bear and they bear the most, they bear severally front of nature's Fury. In our country fortunately we have developed ecosystem because of scientific growth technological application that if we are visited with natural calamities we want the people well in advance our sanitized of the vulnerable presence officer manner otherwise it is limited but then that is one way. How to ensure the problem does not arise is a critical issue can there be predictability of that can we use science to a level where we can find resolution of the serious issue and other aspect the world over and our constitution in particular provides for it equitable distribution of resources and social justice which means the governance must be of a kind that impacts the last man in the line it changes the life for the better of that category of the people who have lost hope by series of steps in last decade India performance is phenomenal it has been of a label which could not be imagined or dream of I say so because it was in 1989 I came to associated with government after being elected to parliament to the house of the people at the part of the government was the big changes as taken place but more is required to be done friends distributive social justice is not only for governance it is for every person in the planet to issue or it he or she has to perform his or her duty and that is giving back to the society something which is vital deforestation habitat fragmentation encroachment of human activities pause significant critical dangerous threat to our rich biodiversity we have made a serious effort in our country that we need to nurture biodiversity preserve it and recreate it if he we can we owe it to the future generations that we are merely trustees at the moment we cannot afford to compromise our future generation by our reckless approach exploitation of natural resources we all are bound to engaged in optimal of utilisation of natural resources the world over there has to be thought process that you are fiscal power cannot be correlated to consumption on utilisation of natural resources fortunately we are finding other ways also so that are dependence on economic front or natural resources is declined take the energy sector renewal energy sources alternate sources of energy.</p><p>My foreign friends would appreciate, this also take a serious geo political aspect to occasions energy has become the other method to wepanization everyone has to be work together to find a solution so that all mighty have given us we generalize that exploit that and fractify that.</p><p>On top of these are challenges the climate change exasperate these challenges and this is what you have addressed frequent forest fire alternate for patterns all over the world you see desert area are being faded the pattern has been change these are issues that chase the ecosystem in a manner with the humidity will take time to adjust so rather than I just fall pray become a victim of this big change let us find a solution I can assure you the world has enough interact.</p><p>Nations have enough worth if they converge they find a solution what is more important they need to relies there is a problem facing us implementation of univertive Technologies is required to be there satellite monitoring is one such way I can tell you it be a grade Pride India became the first country on the planet to land on the south pole of the moon but what is the more important is our ISRO a great scientific output has contributed massively by putting satellite of other countries in the space who are engaged into resolution of issues which you discussed and including of those country that are very developed because ISRO is a good value for money and has scientifics sharper cutting edge sustainable development few years ago was just How was the slogan last 10 year in India we have realised it into the ground the business National clean air program swachh Bharat mission and in the green India mission they are testament to the foresightness visionary approach of prime minister Narendra Modi who has a passion to work for humanity he has a vision that is inconsonance withVasudev kutumbkamwith one Earth one family one future and then is quick at execution this is happened India's focus on climate and environmental action is highlighted by the launch of ambitious green credit program to incentivise environmental friendly activities this is turning out to be a game changer initially it started in slow pace now be look at credit your economy is enhanced in the process there is a gain for larger humidity life style for environment and prime minister has very pressured about it he has focused on this in his monthlyMAN KI BAAThe has focused on this in the parliament he has focused on this in global forum and that is a flexive initiative globally launch by the prime minister two years ago it is fructify into geometric results our mitigation strategy emphasize on clean and efficient energy system safe and smart sustainable green mass urban transportation network friends if you spend few days here you will find our mass transportation system is one of the best in the world those who have been to this country today 2 decades ago will not be able to even appreciate was it there ever connectivity all the all these go also in favour of environmental preservation as the world fastest growing economy India's focused on energy sector it is important for all.</p><p>India is committed and this is part of the issue which you discussed to clean energy and environment by 2030 will be generated by renewable sources. There was a time when we use to wait for years and decades to adopt the technology of the world now we are in the front of using this technology and this technology that makes our environment expect under control let me let me illustrated by one example the National green hydrogen mission with initial outlay of 19000 crore approved by the cabinet in January 2022aims to accelerate the deployment of Green Hydrogen as a clean energy source.No countries applying this are not in double digit but this offers Avenue for employment Avenue for entrepreneurs a venue forindustrial business and scare of the challenges on climate change and environment India took the lead forthe solar alliance established headquarters next to national capital ofDelhi so several initiative have been taken. I am sure during the deliberations you would have thought of many more innovative steps out of the box solutions to the great challenge we face.</p><p>friends I have no doubtI talk about the principle of trusteeship, this planet to ours we will have to handover this planet to future generations to the extend we can keep it as such if not improved</p><p>The decisions we make today will resonate through the ages, shaping the legacy we leave for generations to come. Friends before coming this body of expert this is not my primary area but I just citizen as one of the persons affected I thought over it I kept record for your daily Britain's also what is happening all over global so I have no doubt I can share my thought with you. For resolute and impactful resolution of environmental challengesand climate chane menace it is imperative that there is synergetic global stance as that is the only option. I am sure the deliberations here over two days would so contribute.Let us pledge to work in togetherness at global levelto work for a future where our forests flourish, sustaining life in all its wondrous forms. Let us resolve tousing natural resources wisely and optimally [5:56 PM, 10/27/2023] udaypsinghags: How can we allow an individual to use natural resources on the plank of financial affordability it is unjustify able it is in equator it is un acceptable everyone on the planet is required as trusty to use natural resources of timli and I am sure this will happen one of the greatest human beings according to Einstein people can never believe work on the planet the father of this nation Mahatma Gandhi he shares advice I will end by coating him what the father of nation said</p><p>The earth has enough for everyones need, but not for everyones greed.</p><p>See it in the context of sinister, pernicious, mechanisms all over the world when they deal with wildlife when they deal with foreign produce I am sure your deliberations would go a long way in shaping a strategy that will help planet at large I am grateful to the organisers are according me this unique rare opportunity to reflect on an issue that touches live of every living beings up on the planet lastly to our foreign delegates do please spare time look around the India I can tell you you will see that kind of culture diversity both in nature and human species which you may not find else on the globe.</p><p>Thank you, Thank you so much for your time Jay Hind, Jay Bharat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126213213</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GT-BDM1-DYTH-G0J1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 27, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When there's a problem, they orchestrate the response, directing servicemen and line crews into the field for outage and emergency response and regular system maintenance.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>\"Our job is all about maintaining reliability and public safety,\" said Greg Van Fleet, Clark Public Utilities Dispatch System Operator. \"When there's a fault in the grid, it's like ringing the siren at a fire station.\"<br/>Clark Public Utilities maintains some of the shortest outage durations of any utility in the nation. Those are the product of years of proactive work and collaboration across the utility, but they simply wouldn't be possible without fast-acting and high-performing dispatchers initiating the response.<br/>When they spot trouble, dispatchers send a serviceman out to fix it. If it's too much for one or two people, dispatch sends out a larger and better-equipped line crew.<br/>The dispatch office is the nerve center of the utility. Its employees work directly with several other departments to share critical information between planners, engineers and customer service representatives to the line crews and servicemen on the ground.<br/>When it comes to spotting outages in the 656-square-mile service area, dispatchers have a lot of tools at their disposal, but few are as helpful as customer outage reports. A call to PowerLine or the outage reporting tool on the utility's website help crews pinpoint faults - whether one home or 10,000 are affected.<br/>\"Sometimes we don't know there's an outage if customers don't report it,\" Van Fleet said. \"The more calls we get the faster we can locate the issue.\"<br/>Working as a dispatcher isn't for everyone. It requires specialized trainings and utility industry certifications. Plus, the job can get chaotic, fast, but employees have to stay calm and organized under the pressure and be unafraid to dig into complicated circumstances.<br/>\"One minute everything is going fine, then all of the sudden something like 30,000 people are hit by an outage, and alarms start blaring and the phones ring off the hook, and it's up to you to figure out what's going on and develop a plan as quickly as possible,\" said Van Fleet. \"It can be a lot to handle in the moment, but, when it's over, it's hard to beat the sense of satisfaction you get knowing you orchestrated a quick and successful response.\"<br/>Clark Public Utilities is connected to a multistate transmission system so dispatchers must work closely with area utilities such as the Bonneville Power Administration or PacifiCorp to keep power properly moving.<br/>\"Electricity supply and demand must be in a constant balance to keep the system stable, both locally and regionally\" Van Fleet said. \"Dispatchers are central to maintaining that balance. We help ensure issues in one area don't risk an outage elsewhere.\"<br/>To report an outage at your home, call PowerLine at 360-992-8000 or by clicking \"report an outage\" at clarkpublicutilities.com.<br/>Energy Adviser is produced by Clark Public Utilities and relies on the expertise of utility energy counselors and staff, who provide conservation and energy use information.

Forest Service has issued a ban on all open burning and has canceled all burning permits for the following counties in western North Carolina: Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The burning ban goes into effect at 5 p.m. Friday, April 3, 2020, and will remain in effect until further notice.</p><p>\"With spring wildfire season on us, coupled with the COVID-19 crisis, we don't need to take any unnecessary chances with the dry weather and fuel conditions that will exist in the western part of our state during the next several days,\" said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. \"Until we see more greening in western North Carolina, these hazardous forest fire conditions will continue. This open burning ban is a necessary step to protect lives and property.\"</p><p>Under North Carolina law, the ban prohibits all open burning in the affected counties, regardless of whether a permit was previously issued. The issuance of any new permits has also been suspended until the ban is lifted. Anyone violating the burn ban faces a $100 fine plus $180 court costs. Any person responsible for setting a fire may be liable for reimbursing the N.C. Forest Service for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Local fire departments and law enforcement officers are assisting the N.C. Forest Service in enforcing the burn ban.</p><p>Answers to frequently asked questions</p><p>Q: What is open burning?</p><p>A: Open burning includes burning leaves, branches or other plant material. In all cases, burning trash, lumber, tires, newspapers, plastics or other nonvegetative material is illegal.</p><p>Q: May I still use my grill or barbecue?</p><p>A: Yes, if no other local ordinances prohibit their use.</p><p>Q: How should I report a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: How should I report a person who intentionally starts a wildfire?</p><p>A: Call 911 to report a wildfire.</p><p>Q: My local fire marshal has also issued a burn ban for my county. What does this mean?</p><p>A: The burn ban issued by the N.C. Forest service does not apply to a fire within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. Local government agencies have jurisdiction over open burning within 100 feet of an occupied dwelling. The N.C. Forest Service has advised county fire marshals of the burning ban and has asked for their consideration of also implementing a burning ban. If a fire within a 100-foot area of a dwelling escapes containment, a North Carolina forest ranger may take reasonable steps to extinguish or control it. The person responsible for setting the fire may be liable for reimbursing the N.C. Forest Service for any expenses related to extinguishing the fire.</p><p>Q: Are there other instances which impact open burning?</p><p>A: Local ordinances and air quality regulations may impact open burning. For instance, outdoor burning is prohibited in areas covered by Code Orange or Code Red air quality forecasts. Learn more about air quality forecasts at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecasts\">https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air-quality/air-quality-outreach-education/air-quality-forecasts</url></p><p>Q: Can I have a campfire when I go camping?</p><p>A: Campfires would be considered open burning and are not exempt from the burn ban. Portable gas stoves or grills are alternate methods for cooking food while camping during a burn ban.</p><p>Q: What can I do to protect my house against the risk of wildfire?</p><p>A: Learn about wildfire risk assessments and preparedness and prevention plans on the N.C. Forest Service website at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncforestservice.gov/fire_control/fc_wui.htm\">https://www.ncforestservice.gov/fire_control/fc_wui.htm</url>.</p><p>The N.C. Forest Service will continue to monitor conditions. Residents with questions regarding their specific county can contact their county ranger with the N.C. Forest Service or their county fire marshal's office.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123602400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKC-8KT1-DYTH-G0FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The fire in the region, called Bohemian Switzerland on the Czech side and the Saxon Switzerland National Park on the German side, started last weekend. It had seemed to be under control but spread again early today, German news agency dpa reported. </p><p>Hundreds of firefighters on both sides of the border battled the flames with help from reinforcements from neighboring Poland and Slovakia. Eight firefighting helicopters were working to douse the flames in the hilly and rocky region, which is difficult to access and where about 618 acres of forest was burning today. Local authorities warned tourists to stay away from the area. Saxony state officials banned hikers from entering several forests in the region. To prevent additional blazes, they also asked local residents not to set off fireworks at private parties, \"It's all very tense. We can by no means speak of an easing\" of the fire yet, said Saxony Interior Minister Armin Schuster. \"Firefighters have reached the limits of their capabilities,\" he said. Another large forest fire in the Elbe-Elster district of the eastern German state of Brandenburg was under control today after flaring up again yesterday evening, local authorities said. The fire was still burning an area of 1,236 acres. A police helicopter scouted the area with a thermal camera to look for pockets of embers that could ignite into flames. Some areas are contaminated with World War II ammunition and are too dangerous for firefighters to enter because the heat or human contact could cause explosions. Germany's army has sent several military helicopters to both fires to support local units.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018244fad4e1abff56fa68880000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667J-G5J1-JBSK-R4R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 28, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Large swaths of America are once again engulfed in a toxic haze that's drifted down from Canada, which is experiencing its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65816466\">worst fire season on record</url>. Our northern neighbor has burned through a record-breaking 8.2 million hectares so far this year, sending smoke plumes as far as Europe. And, despite the best efforts of hundreds of firefighting personnel who have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/international-firefighters-canada-wildfires-1.6879084\">come from all over the world</url> to pitch in, the fires don't look like they will be winding down anytime soon.</p><p><br/>The problem is, Canada is not trying to put out just one fire. Right now, a map from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre shows <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/\">a country spotted red with blazes</url>, like it's come down with a nasty case of chicken pox. Remarkably, these fires aren't clustered in a single region: Their spread is the northern equivalent of New York and California burning at the same time, with additional fires stretched in between. <url normalizedValue=\"https://ciffc.net/\">According to the CIFFC</url>, more than 509 fires are active in Canada, 253 of which are classified as \"out of control.\"<br/>Likewise, the smoke that's been descending over America isn't coming from one particular fire. It is the cumulative effect of all those burns, David Roth, a forecaster with NOAA's Weather Prediction Center, told me, though those closer to the border have more of an effect. Until the fires are fully out, Americans will remain at risk of more smoke days.<br/>When will this all be over? In general, a fire can burn as long as it has fuel and oxygen and it's warm enough to do so. So how long do they typically go for? \"That question does not have an answer-or at least not one that's satisfying,\" Issac Sanchez, a battalion chief for communications at CalFire, California's firefighting agency, told me over the phone. Even if we remove human firefighting efforts from the equation, different fires burn at different speeds and for different lengths, depending on where they are located and what is burning. \"Every single fire is its own event,\" Sanchez explained. \"It's got its own behavior. We can't attack them exactly the same way.\" Particularly nasty fires can certainly take weeks or months to resolve. California's largest fire on record, the August Complex, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/16/august-complex-includes-doe-fire/\">burned for 87 days</url>, while its second-largest, the Dixie fire, burned for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2021/7/13/dixie-fire/\">more than 100 days</url>. In 2017, Canada's Elephant Hill fire <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/elephant-hill-emissions-canada/\">burned for well over two months</url>.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/south-extreme-heat-wave-texas-climate-change/674598/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Summer in the South is becoming unbearable</url>]<br/>What's aflame matters. Grasslands burn rapidly, the same way a piece of paper you throw in a fireplace crumbles into ash long before the log beneath it does. A hillside in California can burn itself through quickly, while a more forested area, with thicker, denser brush, might linger. What vegetation is burning, how much, and how dry it is can speed up or slow down fires. <url normalizedValue=\"https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/sustainable-forest-management/boreal-forest/13071\">Most of Canada</url> is classified as boreal forest-chilly, northern forest-and much of the fire is happening in that kind of ecosystem. This type of forest tends to burn at higher intensity and over larger areas because of the kinds of trees and how densely packed they are, Piyush Jain, a research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service, told me. Some boreal forests contain peat, which can slow fire-if it's wet. But if that peat is dry, it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wildfires-peat-challenge-alberta-firefighters-1.6850347\">can burn underground and spread</url> fires even farther.<br/>Weather matters, too. Hot temperatures supercharge fires; the wind spreads them. Snow and rain help dampen flames, sometimes ending fires altogether. Though precipitation doesn't always put them out entirely: In recent years, zombie fires in the Arctic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/05/28/zombie-fires-burning-arctic-siberia/\">have quietly smoldered under the snowpack throughout the winter</url>, only to reignite in the following spring.<br/>Lastly, where a fire takes place can determine its life span: Fires tend to burn uphill, and may struggle to jump a lake or a river. The area's topography also changes how accessible it is to firefighters. Remote, hard-to-access areas sometimes call for parachuting firefighting squads, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/science-technology/fire/people/smokejumpers\">known as smokejumpers</url>.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/wildfire-smoke-brain-health/674336/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How real is smoke brain?</url>]<br/>So-when will this all be over? In Canada, the mean duration of a fire that's more than 1,000 hectares (or a little less than four square miles) is 23 days-or a little over three weeks, according to Jain. Meanwhile, a fire that's more than 10,000 hectares (about 40 square miles) burns for a mean duration of 39 days. Some of the fires active now have been burning for weeks; others are just beginning: In the past 10 hours alone, CIFFC logged three additional fires.<br/>And the currently entrenched fires are big enough that no one really can say how long they will drag on. \"Some of these fires in [the] northern boreal forest of Canada right now are enormous,\" Bruce MacNab, the head of Wildland Fire Information Systems with Natural Resources Canada, told me. \"And it would take some huge rain events to completely stop them.\" He believes that they likely will last \"for some weeks yet.\" Broadly speaking, Canada's fire season tends to start waning by the fall. Karine Pelletier of SOPFEU, Quebec's forest-firefighting agency, told me that, this year, barring many heavy periods of rainfall, the agency expects firefighting operations to last until September.<br/>In the meantime, millions of Americans will have to brace themselves for more extreme smoke days. For exactly how long depends on a number of factors, including, quite literally, which way the wind blows.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-smokecanadafireshowlongmonths674601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KT-SYW1-JCG7-V0C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Basically, limit those additional stressors such as close interactions as much as possible so that they have ability to minimize exertions as well.\"</p><p>Air quality numbers in Madison were in the \"very unhealthy\" zone early Thursday but by later in the day had been upgraded to \"unhealthy,\" according to the DNR. An air quality advisory was in effect through noon on Friday for most of Wisconsin.</p><p>The deluge of smoke comes from more than 490 fires, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported this week that 29,393 square miles of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1, which exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 29,187 square miles, according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>The risk that smoke poses to humans, and to birds, depends somewhat on distance, according to a recent article by the Audubon Society. Toxic gases such as carbon monoxide pose a direct risk to firefighters on the front lines, but smoke's primary hazards are particles smaller than a strand of hair, which can be carried for thousands of miles. And because of their tiny size, they can be absorbed directly into people's bloodstream and, with exposure over time, lead to health problems, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, the Audubon Society reported.</p><p>\"The extent to which smoke affects birds' health isn't as well understood. The health effects may mirror what we see in people and they certainly manifest more quickly,\" said Olivia Sanderfoot, an ecologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the impacts of wildfire smoke on birds. \"Bird lungs are not like human lungs: They are rigid, with several balloon-like air sacs facilitating airflow that travels only one way, so that birds take in air on both the inhale and exhale of a breath. This constant flow of fresh air pulls in roughly twice as much oxygen as human lungs, enabling birds to fly in oxygen-poor air at high altitudes. But it also makes them more susceptible to air pollution.\"</p><p>At the International Crane Foundation near Baraboo, the 114 birds from the around the world have the option of staying outdoors or going into an indoor enclosure, said Kim Gray, the foundation's chief operating officer.</p><p>\"The main thing we've done is a keep a close eye on them,\" Gray said. \"So far they've been coming through all of this really well.\"</p><p>Birds in the wild typically flee when they sense danger, like from an approaching fire. But with the smoke that has covered Wisconsin, it's unlikely birds and other wildlife are feeling threatened.</p><p>\"There's no imminent danger so they'll just wait it out,\" Gray said. \"It takes a lot of energy for bird to take on a new location. As long as there's still food and there's still water, they're going to stick to that.\"</p><p>For the animals at the Vilas Zoo in Madison, precautions depend on the indoor spaces available. Otters and the red panda are being given choices on whether they want to be inside or outside, but over the last two days the otters have been inside more than outside, according to Kristin Moala, the zoo's outreach specialist.</p><p>The three orangutans, including 1-year-old Menjadi, are being kept indoors since their inside space is similar in size to their outdoor space, Moala said.</p><p>The zoo remains open, staff are being equipped with N95 masks, and youth educational programs are taking place indoors. Sunday's Family Fun Day will go on as scheduled.</p><p>\"We're just keeping our fingers crossed that this will be blowing out soon,\" Moala said. \"We definitely have fewer people at the zoo and we're definitely being impacted by it but were doing everything we can to keep our staff and our animals safe.\"</p><p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>BARRY ADAMS, STATE JOURNAL A woodchuck emerges from the brush along the Lake Monona shoreline on Wednesday near the Olin Park boat landing.

The fires have been exacerbated by a nearly 13-year-long drought in the country, as well as a heat wave. </p><p><br/>Many of the fires are concentrated in the Biobo region, located about 560 kilometres (348 miles) south of the capital city of Santiago. Four of the deaths reported so far have taken place there and many of the deaths involved vehicles. <br/>'In one case, they were burned because they were hit by the fire,' interior minister Carolina Toha said. In the other case, she added, they suffered an accident while 'probably trying to escape the fire'. <br/>The Associated Press also reported that a firefighter was hit by a truck while fighting the flames. <br/>The government has declared a state of catastrophe in Biobio and the neighbouring region of Nuble, another area hit hard by the fires. Toha said the region of La Araucania was also struggling to contain the blazes, amid strong winds and high temperatures fuelled by Chile's withering heat wave[1]. <br/>On Friday, weather forecasts predicted temperatures of more than 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) in Nuble's capital of Chillan. <br/>Hundreds of homes have reportedly been damaged or destroyed, but the exact number remains uncertain. <br/>Chile's President Gabriel Boric cut his vacation short to visit affected areas, saying the 'full force of the state will be deployed' to control the blazes and assist victims. <br/>Para mantener la seguridad de los hogares y apoyar evacuaci\u00f3n en zonas rurales afectadas por los incendios forestales, @Carabdechile[2] contin\u00faa patrullajes preventivos en las regiones de uble y Biobo. En conjunto enfrentamos la emergencia. pic.twitter .com/p5Y2nu0Puu[3]; <br/>\u2014 Presidencia de Chile (@Presidencia_cl) February 3, 2023[4] <br/>Partly due to climate change[5], wildfires have grown in scope, intensity and frequency as rising temperatures[6] and drought heighten fire conditions around the world, resulting in explosive blazes in places like Chile, Algeria, France, Spain and the western United States[7]. <br/>In late December, a forest fire[8] near the coastal resort town of Vinas Del Mar in Chile killed at least one person and destroyed more than 100 homes. <br/>'Families are having a very difficult time,' Ivonne Rivas, the mayor of Tome in the Biobo region, told a local radio station. 'It's hell what they are living through, the fire got away from us.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera\">https://www.aljazeera</url> .com/news/2022/10/10/future-heatwaves-will-lead-to-large-loss-of-life-report-warns [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Carabdechile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/Carabdechile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/p5Y2nu0Puu\">https://t.co/p5Y2nu0Puu</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Presidencia_cl/status/1621594743682514948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/Presidencia_cl/status/1621594743682514948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/24/how-climate-change-drives-heatwaves-and-wildfires\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/24/how-climate-change-drives-heatwaves-and-wildfires</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/record-heatwave-europe-uk-france-spain-wildfires</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/12/thousands-evacuated-as-wildfires-spread-across-western-us\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/12/thousands-evacuated-as-wildfires-spread-across-western-us</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/23/chile-declares-state-of-emergency-after-wildfire-kills-two\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/23/chile-declares-state-of-emergency-after-wildfire-kills-two</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/4/death-toll-rises-as-chile-reels-from-wildfires-driven-by-heatwave\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ALJZ136341167547062986225876100033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALJZ-136341</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67G6-W261-F03R-N088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><timeReceived>12:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Al Jazeera English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 4, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chile</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Latin America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Crisis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

With an increase in extreme climate-related weather events worldwide, including Canada's record spring forest fire season this year, the urgency of the situation calls for more ambition and international cooperation on climate action to keep the 1.5 C Paris Agreement warming limit within reach and avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, concluded his participation in the seventh Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) in Brussels, Belgium. Canada, along with His Excellency Huang Runqiu, Minister of Ecology and Environment of China, and Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal (European Commission), co-convened the two days of meetings with over 29 ministers and other high-level representatives, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, and 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) President-designate Dr. Sultan Al Jaber from the United Arab Emirates, to agree on priorities to increase international momentum in the lead up to COP28.</p><p>At MoCA, participating ministers shared expectations for COP28, including the need to keep global warming to 1.5 C within reach and to work together to support people and communities everywhere who are experiencing severe impacts as a result of the climate crisis. Canada stressed the need for new and enhanced concrete actions to reduce emissions, its commitment to an inclusive approach to addressing climate change, the importance of establishing a fund and funding arrangements for loss and damage at COP28, as well as its commitment to make climate and biodiversity action mutually reinforcing following the historic adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework during COP15. Canada came to Brussels ready to demonstrate and deliver on an ambitious outcome.</p><p>The Minister also announced $450 million in new funding for the second replenishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), a 50 percent increase from Canada's pledge to the GCF's first replenishment in 2019. The GCF is a critical funding mechanism of the Paris Agreement to support low-emission, climate-resilient development pathways. Minister Guilbeault encouraged other countries to follow Canada's contribution to the GCF, which will further strengthen its ability to respond to the climate crisis and is part of the collective US$100 billion climate finance goal, which is on track to be achieved this year and through to 2025.</p><p>During MoCA, the Minister collaborated with his co-conveners from China and the EU. The Minister also strengthened relationships with representatives of several countries, including Singapore's Minister of Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu; German State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action, Jennifer Morgan; and the United Kingdom's Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero, Graham Stuart. Furthermore, the Minister hosted a roundtable discussion with youth, environmental non-governmental organizations, think tanks, and leading business organizations on the clean energy transition and our shared climate priorities.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"It's sobering to witness smoke from Canada's historic forest fires this spring reaching as far as Europe. This is a stark reminder that the climate crisis is affecting us all. We need to work together and take more ambitious action. The world is looking to those of us in leadership positions to put aside any differences and deliver real solutions across all fronts--the cost of failure is too high.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quick facts</p><p>* Ministers and high-level representatives of more than 20 countries participated in MoCA7: Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt (COP27 President), Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Senegal (Chair of Least Developed Countries), Singapore, South Korea, Spain (President of the Council of the European Union), Switzerland, Turkiye, United Arab Emirates (COP28 President), the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zambia (Chair of African Group). European Union representatives also took part.</p><p>* Canada hosted the first Ministerial Meeting on Climate Action (MoCA) in Montreal in 2017. The goal is to bring together major economies and key climate actors to discuss concrete steps to help advance implementation of the Paris Agreement and demonstrate continued commitment to global climate action.</p><p>* This spring, Minister Guilbeault and Jennifer Morgan, German State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action, hosted a group of climate finance contributors to take stock of the US$100 billion collective mobilization goal. Based on the positive updates from this meeting, contributors reiterated confidence that they are on track to meet the goal this year and each year through 2025.</p><p>* In 2021, Canada doubled its international climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over five years and is delivering on its commitment. Canada's total climate finance goes beyond its official climate finance pledge and includes funding export credit support, core contributions to multilateral development banks, private finance mobilized through public investments, support from FinDev Canada, and other international assistance with a climate change component.</p><p>* Canada continues to support efforts by developing countries to phase out coal and has made progress on the Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) program under the Climate Investment Funds (CIF). Canada's contribution, which represents approximately one third of total current funding, directly supports coal-power retirement plans in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, the Dominican Republic, and North Macedonia.</p><p>* As part of its commitment to tackle multiple crises and support multilateralism, Canada will continue to collaborate on key issues ahead of COP28 later this year and will welcome the world to Ottawa in April 2024 for the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-4) on Plastic Pollution to work toward a global agreement.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2023/07/canada-concludes-productive-discussions-with-international-partners-in-belgium-ahead-of-cop28.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2023/07/canada-concludes-productive-discussions-with-international-partners-in-belgium-ahead-of-cop28.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8217517 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8217517</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68R2-GDW1-JC11-11WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1120\"/><timeReceived>2:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 16, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I can share numerous examples of wildfires I was personally involved in where we chose to allow the fires to burn under Control/Containment Guidelines. In most cases these fires burned as planned, but in other cases they did not. When fires escape their control lines the risk is transferred to surrounding properties and the additional men and women who are assembled to fight the, now larger, wildfire. I submit the following eight points for support for this bill:</p><p>1) Firefighting resources are limited and valuable. Committing personnel to monitoring fires that are not being actively suppressed is unwise at this time.</p><p>2) Fires are more extreme across this country than has been historical. Often I heard \"I have never seen wildfire behavior like I saw on this fire\". Things are different now. It is now particularly important now to put out wildfires when they are small.</p><p>3) Fire behavior and prediction models are being refined but in some cases did not accurately predict the observed behavior. This is not the time to be managing unplanned ignitions.</p><p>4) I am very aware that at times this bill would put a burden on firefighting resources.</p><p>5) The forests have had fire excluded for many decades. The condition of the forests, particularly in the West is very different than it was when the Forest Service began managing public land. Many stands are overstocked and contain numerous dead trees. This is not a reasonable place to manage unplanned ignitions when in CA 8 of the 20 largest fires have occurred since 2020.</p><p>6) This bill simply directs the Forest Service to do what they used to do, to direct resources to suppress wildfire and to do prescribed burning with a higher level of planning.</p><p>7) Line officers can find themselves trying to find a balance between the desires of forest fire restoration advocates and fire suppression when there may not be the time and information necessary to make a reasoned decision. I have been in that position and I fully understand the importance of returning fire to the landscape. It is essential.</p><p>8) The agencies have used many terms and phrases to communicate what they are doing is exhausting and confusing. Fire Use, Alternative Containment strategy, Confine/ Control, Managed for Resource Benefits are all used to describe to the public what is going on. It may appear to most people that the fire is being \"let burn\".</p><p>I fully support H.R. 188 as it provides a clear message from the elected officials in this body to agency officials regarding the urgency and appropriateness of fuel treatment. The bill is fully supportive of the mission of the Forest Service. I submit the following four points for support for this bill:</p><p>1) The agency appears to be struggling to deliver fuel treatment expectations even though they have received millions of dollars from Congress. This bill will provide additional encouragement by giving them expanded use of Categorial Exclusions.</p><p>2) It is critical that the work of fuel treatment be pursued aggressively. Wildfires are depleting the public's fiber resources and putting the agency's mission at risk.</p><p>3) The condition of the nation's forests is in urgent need of fuel treatment and thinning. It is especially critical where public lands are adjacent to communities and private lands, particularly industrial forest lands.</p><p>4) Requiring the agency to consult with impacted parties, representatives of local governments and interested entities should not be an excessive burden to the agencies.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II10/20230523/115955/HHRG-118-II10-Wstate-CrabtreeL-20230523.pdf\">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II10/20230523/115955/HHRG-118-II10-Wstate-CrabtreeL-20230523.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC523322L6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689H-2M21-JCCP-04H1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 23, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The objectives of the study were two-fold: firstly, to generate meaningful nickel-sulphide-focused targets across the property using its proprietary SmartTARGETTM AI technology, and secondly, to use the new exploration data to reinterpret the geology underlying the Ducros claims.</p><p>The unique fingerprint of the Ni-Cu-PGE Fortin Sill Zone was used to train the SmartTARGETTM targeting algorithms. This involved the integration and synthesis of multiple exploration datasets including the recently completed VTEMTM, airborne gravity, high-resolution drone magnetics and Lidar surveys, along with the data from two seasons worth of surface biogeochemical surveys and the Ducros diamond drilling assay, lithogeochemical and geotechnical databases. ALS GoldSpot used its Supervised Learning (\"SL\") and Semisupervised Learning (\"SSL\") algorithms on 25-metre and 10-metre datastacks during its study.</p><p>More than a dozen new nickel-sulphide targets have been generated by the study, the locations of which can be seen in Figure 1. Of note, several of the new nickel-sulphide targets, which are characterized as having a geophysical conductive response comparable to that of the Fortin Sill Zone, lie along strike of the Fortin Sill Zone, immediately adjacent to the recently discovered Q-Zone, within the southern portion of the Ducros Ultramafic Sill Complex and along strike to the south of the Ducros Sill Trend (Figure 1). As part of the targeting exercise, several new non-conductive large-tonnage nickel-cobalt anomalies were also generated (Figure 1), similar in character to the Q-Zone and Ducros Sill Trend.</p><p>In parallel with the AI targeting project, ALS GoldSpot also completed a litho-structural reinterpretation of the Ducros Property. Due to the relatively thick and consistent blanket of surface cover at the property, the new geological interpretation leans heavily on short wavelength airborne magnetic data in combination with the growing Ducros drillhole database. The results of this new geological interpretation can be seen in Figure 1 and are highlighted by a better understanding of the primary geological structural framework of the Ducros property and how this affects the interpreted location and extent of some key mafic-ultramafic intrusive bodies. It is expected this new geological interpretation will greatly enhance the Company's exploration efforts going forward by allowing future work programs to focus on the most prospective Ni-Cu-PGE targets within the large &gt;15,000-hectare Ducros property.</p><p>Ducros Property Exploration Update</p><p>As announced on <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2023%2F08%2Fquebec-nickel-resumes-drilling-at-fortin-sill-nickel-copper-pge-zone%2F&amp;esheet=53578613&amp;newsitemid=20231005135364&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=August+9%2C+2023&amp;index=3&amp;md5=befec19c45cfc8b636717d0d06c9b847\">August 9, 2023</url> , the Company reports the program of exploration drilling and down-hole geophysics at the Fortin Sill target area continues as planned. The new drilling at Fortin Sill is focused on exploring for additional Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides down-plunge and along strike of the main outcropping mineralized showing. Up to 5,000 metres of drilling is planned for this phase of work, which will explore at depth beneath the Ni-Cu-PGE Zone as well as more than two kilometers of strike length of prospective geology. This work will also test the geological model discussed in the Company's <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quebecnickel.com%2F2022%2F12%2Fquebec-nickel-reports-new-high-grade-assay-results-from-fortin-sill-zone-drilling-including-1-07-ni-1-19-cu-364-ppm-co-2-70-g-t-pt-pd-au-over-4-77-metres%2F&amp;esheet=53578613&amp;newsitemid=20231005135364&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=December+15%2C+2022+news+release&amp;index=4&amp;md5=69cc546aba483c6c9627ef9862a1d4d6\">December 15, 2022 news release</url> . Downhole electromagnetic geophysical surveys are being used to identify and target accumulations of conductive Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides during this phase of drilling. Since the restart of drilling in August, a total of five deep holes have been completed and are currently being logged and sampled, three of which have been surveyed with down-hole geophysics to date. This phase of drilling is expected to continue until later this fall and possibly into the winter months, depending on local ground conditions.</p><p>Corporate Update</p><p>The Company is happy to announce that David Patterson, Executive Chairman of QNI, has returned to his role as QNI's Chief Executive Officer effective October 1, 2023.

A fire that broke at Saturday morning on the island of Lesbos prompted authorities to call for the evacuation of the Vatera resort on the island's southern side. </p><p>The fire came very close to the resort and at least one house was engulfed by the flames. But more than five hours after an emergency message was sent by phone to residents, the evacuation was still \"ongoing,\" fire service spokesman Yannis Artopoios told reporters. He said 50 firefighters with 17 fire engines, nine special firefighting planes and one helicopter are fighting the blaze. Local police said Saturday afternoon they had evacuated over 450 people from two hotels and 92 houses and that 60 officers were scouring the area for anyone that refused to move. Greece's biggest fire Saturday was burning in the northeast near the border with Turkey for the third day running, inside a national forest that is the home to rare species, especially vultures. The Dadia national forest is mostly made up of highly flammable pine trees. Two more major fires were burning Saturday, one in a remote mountainous area in the region of Western Macedonia and another in the Peloponnese region, Artopoios said. The European Union gave Greece's forest service 72 million euros this year to help maintain forests and clear them to prevent fires from spreading.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press A firefighter tries to extinguishes a forest fire Saturday near the beach resort of Vatera, on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos, Greece.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001385873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:660X-D351-DY6F-J4D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditioneBlast EditionCLFM EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionMF12 EditionML2 EditionNC EditionNC1 EditionNC14 EditionNC14C EditionNC2 EditionNC3 EditionNC4 EditionNL1 EditionNM1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 24, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Detroit, a mostly Black city with a poverty rate of about 30%, had some of the worst air quality in the U.S. on Wednesday, prompting the Environmental Protection Agency to warn that \"everyone should stay indoors.\"</p><p>\"The more breaths you're taking, you're inhaling, literally, a fire, camp smoke, into your lungs,\" said Darren Riley, who was diagnosed with asthma in 2018, a few years after arriving in Detroit.</p><p>\"Many communities face this way too often,\" said Riley, who is Black. \"And while this wildfire smoke allows, unfortunately, many people to feel this burden, this is a burden that far too long communities have faced day in and day out.\"</p><p>The EPA's AirNow.gov site showed cities including Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Ohio, had \"very unhealthy air\" as of Wednesday afternoon. A wider circle of unhealthy air spread into Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Louisville, Kentucky.</p><p>Earlier this month, smoke from the wildfires blanketed the U.S. East Coast for days.</p><p>Another round of drifting smoke from the wildfires was moving through western Pennsylvania and central New York and headed toward the Mid-Atlantic, said National Weather Service meteorologist Byran Jackson. In Canada, smoke will migrate across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said.</p><p>Detroit's southwest side is home to a number of sprawling refineries and manufacturing plants. It is one of the poorest parts of the city. According to a 2022 report by the American Lung Association, the city's long- and short-term particle pollution ranked among the worst in the nation.</p><p>\"Being close to those refineries - that's an environmental factor that's difficult to control,\" said Dr. Ruma Srivastava, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. \"It does increase their risk for asthma flareups. For them, it's even more important to follow the (air quality safety) recommendations.\"</p><p>Riley's own experiences prompted him to start JustAir, which provides air pollution monitoring.</p><p>\"Just because you're born in a certain ZIP code or you're born into a certain family with a certain skin color doesn't mean that you should have an unequal go at it,\" he said.</p><p>Elsewhere, Milwaukee County Emergency Medical Services saw a spike in calls for residents with respiratory complaints, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Office of Emergency Management data show a disproportionate amount of calls for respiratory issues\u00a0- 54.8%\u00a0- have been for Black people in Milwaukee, according to the newspaper. Milwaukee County's population is 27.1% Black.</p><p>In Chicago, where about 29% of the population is Black, Mayor Brandon Johnson urged young people, older adults and residents with health issues to spend more time indoors. He pledged \"swift action to ensure that vulnerable individuals have the resources they need to protect themselves and their families.\"</p><p>Minnesota issued a record 23rd air quality alert for the year through late Wednesday night, as smoky skies obscured the skylines of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana were among other states issuing air quality alerts, and cities including Louisville also advised people to limit prolonged or intense outdoor activity.</p><p>\"This is particularly thick smoke,\" said Jackson, with the National Weather Service.</p><p>Across Canada, 490 fires are burning, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported Monday that 29,393 square miles of land including forests has burned across Canada since Jan. 1. That exceeds the previous record set in 1989 of 29,187 square miles, according to the National Forestry Database.</p><p>\"As long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,\" said Flisfeder, the Canadian meteorologist.</p><p>The small particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can affect the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe. Health officials say it's important to limit outdoor activities to avoid breathing in the particles.</p><p>The warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, said Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington.</p><p>Quentin Hernandez, a 24-year-old event planner from Detroit, was out skateboarding for about an hour Wednesday at a skate park near the Ambassador Bridge, which connects the city and Windsor, Ontario.</p><p>\"It just sits like this all day,\" said Hernandez, saying that it smelled like being at a barbecue. \"Literally, the smoke just sits in the air.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Smoke pouring down from Canadian wildfires has created air quality so bad, that Chicago's is currently the worst on Earth. Still, not everyone was heeding those warnings on Tuesday. CBS 2's Andrew Ramos came across many people going about their business.

A freighter passes through the Detroit River Wednesday as smoke fills the sky reducing visibility to Windsor, Ontario, as seen from Detroit.

Canadian wildfires have led to the worst air quality New York has ever had-and the worst air quality anywhere in the world right now. The air has taken on a sepia tint, and the city looks like the setting of a postapocalyptic movie.</p><p><br/>Many individuals are blaming the situation on climate change and calling for mass government intervention. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, has used it to renew her call for a Green New Deal. This is an example of what Mises Institute fellow Joshua Mawhorter has referred to as the statist non sequitur: \"The statist non sequitur involves the existence of a problem followed by the alleged solution of statism. It is typically put in the form of a statement or a loaded question presupposing the necessity of a 'solution' imposed by the state as the obvious and sole conclusion.\"<br/>We must provide a better answer than the statist non sequitur.<br/>For this we can turn to perhaps the loudest voice in defense of fossil fuels, Alex Epstein. Fossil fuels are routinely attacked for their alleged cause of extreme climate events like this wildfire-induced haze. However, Epstein has argued in his book Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas-Not Less that even conceding the most radical anti-fossil fuel claims regarding global warming, fossil fuels are still a benefit to society. \"Even if we concede fossil fuels have caused global warming,\" he asks, \"how have climate related deaths trended since the proliferation of fossil fuels?\" He replies:<br/>Over the last century, as CO2 emissions have most rapidly increased, the climate disaster death rate fell by an incredible 98 percent. That means the average person is fifty times less likely to die of a climate-related cause than they were in the 1920s.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.<br/>A dramatic reduction in climate-related death has to be the result of at least one of two factors: (1) an improvement in the state of climate conditions and/or (2) an improvement in the state of our ability to protect ourselves from climate.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.<br/>The dramatic change has to be an improvement in our ability to protect ourselves from climate dangers such as extreme temperatures, drought, storms, floods, and wildfires.<br/>How have we gotten so good at protecting ourselves from climate?<br/>In large part by using fossil-fueled machine labor.<br/>We use fossil-fueled construction machines to build sturdy buildings. We use fossil-fueled heating machines to produce warmth when it's cold and fossil-fueled cooling machines to produce cool air when it's hot. We use fossil-fueled irrigation machines to alleviate drought.<br/>To put the relationship between fossil fuels and our safety from climate in a sentence: ultra-cost-effective fossil fuel energy powers the machines that produce unprecedented protection from climate.<br/>Epstein demonstrates that even if fossil fuels create climate change and cause significantly worse climate conditions, the vast technological benefits of fossil fuels have been so overwhelming that that there have been fifty times fewer climate deaths than there were one hundred years ago. Therefore human flourishing is stronger thanks to the effects of fossil fuels.<br/>With these facts in mind, what is the best way to deal with forest fires? Epstein explains that there are three ways to fight wildfires-reducing fuel load, building fire barriers, and intelligently fighting fires-and that all of them are more effective with the help of fossil fuel-powered machinery.<br/>Fuel load reduction consists of intentionally scorching fire-prone areas to remove potential wildfire fuel (such as dead trees and leaves) before it piles up enough to feed a forest fire. These controlled burns used to be done regularly in western US forests until the US Forest Service and environmentalists put a stop to them. Epstein thinks we should reimplement fuel load reduction, writing:<br/>Today we have the ability to use fossil-fueled machines to do far more targeted controlled burns by creating firebreaks to prevent uncontrolled spread, planning the exact area to be burned, and assessing success with satellite imagery or via airplane. In addition to controlled burns, we can use fossil-fueled machine labor to do logging, in which case we actually convert the wood that could cause wildfire into wealth. We can also do mechanical brush clearing, using tractors with mulchers and other equipment attached.<br/>Fire barriers are another great way to control forest fires. The same fossil fuel-burning engines that now allow us to better execute controlled burns also allow us to build larger, stronger fire barriers \"between forests and people-or, if desired, between one area of forest and another.\"<br/>The last resort in controlling wildfires is of course firefighting, and this has also been improved by fossil fuels. As Epstein explains, \"We use fossil-fueled machines and fossil fuel materials to fight fires when they start. We use high-energy fossil-fueled machines, like trucks and aircraft for transporting water, and flame-resistant, oil derived materials such as Nomex to protect firefighters.\"<br/>Every method of fighting fires-and thus for protecting against their wide ripple effects, like hazardous air quality-has been vastly improved by fossil fuels. Those calling for political action against fossil fuel use are therefore calling for more wildfire destruction, not less.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-186220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FB-DHJ1-JCG7-83GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 Mises, Canada All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ludwig Von Mises Institute Of Canada</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 10, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting out of Oslo, Norway, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Wildfires are recurrent natural hazards that affect terrestrial ecosystems, the carbon cycle, climate and society. They are typically hard to predict, as their exact location and occurrence are driven by a variety of factors.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Nederlandse Organisatie Voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Oslo: \"Identifying a selection of dominant controls can ultimately improve predictions and projections of wildfires in both the current and a future climate. Data-driven models are suitable for identification of dominant factors of complex and partly unknown processes and can both help improve process-based models and work as independent models. In this study, we applied a data-driven machine learning approach to identify dominant hydrometeorological factors determining fire occurrence over Fennoscandia and produced spatiotemporally resolved fire danger probability maps. A random forest learner was applied to predict fire danger probabilities over space and time, using a monthly (2001-2019) satellite-based fire occurrence dataset at a 0.25 spatial grid as the target variable. The final data-driven model slightly outperformed the established Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) used for comparison. Half of the 30 potential predictors included in the study were automatically selected for the model. Shallow volumetric soil water anomaly stood out as the dominant predictor, followed by predictors related to temperature and deep volumetric soil water. Using a local fire occurrence record for Norway as target data in a separate analysis, the test set performance increased considerably. This demonstrates the potential of developing reliable data-driven models for regions with a high-quality fire occurrence record and the limitation of using satellite-based fire occurrence data in regions subject to small fires not identified by satellites.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"We conclude that data-driven fire danger probability models are promising, both as a tool to identify the dominant predictors and for fire danger probability mapping. The derived relationships between wildfires and the selected predictors can further be used to assess potential changes in fire danger probability under different (future) climate scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A data-driven model for Fennoscandian wildfire danger.

(TSX-V: BRW, OTCQB: BRWXF; \u201cBRW\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the discovery of a significant lithium pegmatite outcrop, measuring at least 100m long by 15m large, at the Anatacau Main Project, located in the Eeyou Istchee-James Bay region of Quebec. The outcrop is within a larger cluster of pegmatite dykes all of which contain high grade lithium mineralization.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Killian Charles, President and CEO of BRW, comments: \u201cThis exciting discovery demonstrates the clear potential of the Anatacau Main Property which has never been systematically explored for lithium. Both the Anatacau Main and West Projects remain very prospective for additional pegmatite discoveries. As exploration remains restricted due to forest fire and alongside the recent discovery of the substantial spodumene-bearing boulder field at Mirage, BRW is now preparing a major drilling campaign in Q3 across several assets.\u201d</p><p>The Anais Spodumene-Bearing Pegmatite Showing</p><p>This discovery is located 22km east of BRW\u2019s Anatacau West and Allkem\u2019s James Bay Project along a large-scale E-W deformation corridor which is host to the known lithium-bearing pegmatite dykes in the region. This structure runs through both the Anatacau West and Anatacau Main properties over a total of 15.5 km (see Figure 1), all of which has never been explored for lithium.</p><p>The showing consists of several parallel pegmatite dykes with visible spodumene mineralization. The largest dyke found to date is exposed over a 15m wide by 100m long outcrop (see Figure 2). The mineralization varies between 5% and 50% spodumene throughout the pegmatite, with quartz, feldspars and accessory muscovite. Spodumene crystals are light grey and up to 20cm long (see Figure 3). BRW believes the pegmatite dykes are structurally controlled, dip steeply towards the north-west with gentle folding and stacking.</p><p>To date, BRW has collected over 19 surface grab samples across the Anais showing all of which returned high grades values ranging from 1.2 to 3.8% Li2O. The majority of the samples graded above 2% Li2O, among which the highest grades (&gt;3% Li2O) are found within the Main dyke, in massive spodumene-rich bands. Note that the described samples are selected samples and thus the values reported above are not representative of the grade of mineralized zones.</p><p>BRW will pursue exploration work on its Anatacau West and Main Project once conditions are deemed safe. In the interim, BRW will immediately apply for necessary permits to support an Autumn 2023 drilling campaign.</p><p>Figure 1: Regional Total Field Magnetic Map of the Anatacau West and Main Projects</p><p/><p>Figure 2: Aerial Photograph of the Anais Showing Outcrop</p><p/><p>Figure 3: Massive Light Grey Prismatic Spodumene Crystals</p><p/><p>About the Anatacau Project</p><p>The Anatacau Main and the Anatacau West Projects are under option from Osisko GP, a subsidiary of Osisko Development whereby BRW can earn a 90% interest in the projects.

One tiny spark can unleash an inferno.<br/>Fighting forest fires in Europe has never been so hard. Here's why:<br/>WHAT'S CAUSING EUROPE'S WILDFIRES?<br/>The continent's so-called rural exodus since the second half of the last century, as Europeans moved to cities in search of a better life, has left significant areas of countryside neglected and vulnerable.<br/>Woodland is littered with combustible material, says Johann Goldammer, head of the Global Fire Monitoring Center, an advisory body to the United Nations. That includes things like dead tree trunks and fallen branches, dead leaves and desiccated grass.<br/>\"This is why we have unprecedented wildfire risk: because never before in history - say, the last 1,000 or 2,000 years - has there been so much flammable material around,\" he said.<br/>Carelessness with naked flames is often enough to ignite a wildfire. In Portugal, where more than 100 people died in wildfires in 2017, authorities say 62 percent of outbreaks stem from farming activities such as burning stubble.<br/>IS GLOBAL WARMING A FACTOR IN THE WILDFIRES?<br/>Climate change has added a scary new dimension to wildfires and made them more menacing.<br/>That is especially true in southern Europe, where the increasing occurrence of fire weather conditions - high temperatures, drought and high winds - make summer wildfires \"the new norm,\" says Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London.<br/>The European Union noted this month that over the past five years the bloc has witnessed its most intense wildfires on record and that the continent's current drought could become its worst ever. The Mediterranean region is warming 20 percent faster than the global average, according to the U.N.<br/>EU fire statistics bear witness to the problem. The amount of burned European countryside has more than tripled this year, with almost 450,000 hectares charred through July 16, compared with a 2006-2021 average of 110,000 hectares in those same months.<br/>ARE WILDFIRES DIFFERENT NOW?<br/>The droughts and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight, as conditions make it easier for them to spread quickly. Scientists say climate change will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.<br/>That includes instances of so-called \"megafires\" - blazes so big they are virtually unstoppable.<br/>Spain's wildfire problems this year began with the arrival in spring of the country's earliest heat wave in two decades.

The lightning-caused fire began July 17 and is being allowed to fulfill its natural role in a fire-dependent ecosystem.</p><p>Located 5 miles west of the North Rim Lodge, the Dragon Fire is burning in continuous ponderosa pine forest. Fire managers plan to continue monitoring fire activity while buffering containment lines to the north and east of the fire. All actions are being based on firefighter and public safety as well as current and expected fire weather and environmental conditions.</p><p>As of this morning, the Tiyo Point Trail is closed and motorists driving along the W-1/Point Sublime Road should be aware of fire personnel and equipment in the vicinity. Motorists should watch out for snags across the roadway and slow down for emergency response vehicles. Southwest-west winds may move smoke east towards the North Rim Grand Canyon Lodge and smoke may also be seen from the South Rim.</p><p>Wildfire is a natural process within the fire adapted ecosystem on the North Rim. By allowing the Dragon Fire to carry out this natural process, a variety of resource objectives will be met including reduction of hazardous fuels, promoting forest regeneration, improving wildlife habitat, and restoring a more open forest understory.</p><p>Resources assigned to the fire are 2 wildland fire engines, 2 wildland fire modules, a 20-person hand crew, 1 helicopter, and local resource specialists.

Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as North Carolina and Indiana, affecting millions of people.</p><p>\"I can taste the air,\" Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, N.Y., which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.</p><p>In Baltimore, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Fort McHenry, a national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon as distant ships pushed slowly through the haze.</p><p>\"I walked outside this morning, and it was like a waft of smoke,\" said Funk. She said the couple planned to stay inside later Wednesday, as officials were urging.</p><p>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.</p><p>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been lapping into the U.S. since last month but intensified with recent fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control Wednesday - which, unsettlingly, was national Clean Air Day in Canada.</p><p>The smoke was so thick in downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital, that office towers just across the Ottawa River were barely visible. Quebec Premier Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Legault said the province currently has the capacity to fight about 40 fires - and the usual reinforcements from other provinces have been strained by conflagrations in Nova Scotia and elsewhere.</p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have already arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more will be arriving soon.</p><p>In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. His administration has contacted some U.S. governors and local officials about providing assistance, she said.</p><p>The largest town in Northern Quebec - Chibougamau, population about 7,500 - was evacuated Tuesday, and Legault said the roughly 4,000 residents of the northern Cree town Mistissini would likely have to leave Wednesday. But later in the day, Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano said his community remains safe and asked residents to wait for instructions from Cree officials.</p><p>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense.</p><p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he noted.</p><p>Across the border, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned the public to \"prepare for this over the long haul.\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams told residents of the United States' most populous city to limit outdoor activities and parks officials closed beaches as smoke smudged out the skyline.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.</p><p>Major League Baseball put off games in New York and Philadelphia, and even an indoor WNBA game in Brooklyn was called off. The smoke even affected Broadway, where \"Killing Eve\" star Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing and left the matinee after 10 minutes; the show restarted with an understudy, show publicists said.</p><p>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K, advised participants to adjust their plans according to air quality.</p><p>New Jersey closed state offices early, and some political demonstrations in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were moved indoors or postponed. Striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area.</p><p>The smoke exacerbated health problems for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis.</p><p>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Burnett said, \"I came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed.\"</p><p>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself.</p><p>\"It's unfortunate, and I'm having some problems for it, but there should be help for them,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5153369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68F2-XC01-DYWP-812M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"929\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

According to news reporting out of Jiangsu, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Porosity is one of the important factors to determine the fuel efficiency and the risk of forest combustible fire. In this work, we explore the porosity effect on the ignition phenomena, autoignition limit, and extinction of flaming combustion.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), University Natural Science Research Project in Jiangsu Province, Postgraduate Research &amp; Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Tech University, \"The ignition experiment of pine needle and wood powder fuel bed with various porosity was conducted under external radiation at a constant heat flux of 5-60 kW/m2. Several ignition phenomena including the cone-piloted flaming ignition, smouldering, smouldering to flaming transition, and no ignition can be obtained. And the pine needle could be burnt out in the flaming state, but the wood powder was easily ignited and presented a short flaming period, such as only 10% mass loss in flaming combustion and 70 -80% mass loss in smouldering combustion for an 84.67% porosity fuel under the radiant heat flux of 35 kW/m2. The ignition of a larger porosity fuel bed is more difficult, requiring a higher critical heat flux. The measurements suggested that the porosity was important to determine smouldering to flaming transition, but weak affected the smouldering ignition with the critical surface temperature 350 degrees C to pine needle and 280 degrees C to wood powder. The porosity has a slight influence on the ignition time and critical mass flux, with an order of magnitude lower than incident heat flux. The fuel with low porosity is more likely to be self-extinguished due to limited oxygen supply, and responds to a higher critical mass flux of flaming self-extinguishing. The proposed heat-transfer analysis explains and well predicted the ignition limit and delay time.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This research helps understand the development of biomass burners and forest fire, and the interaction between flaming and smouldering fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Effect of Porosity On Ignition and Burning Behavior of Cellulose Materials.

He uses numbers from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System.</p><p><br/>\"Wildfires have been getting less frequent in Canada over the past 30 years,\" McKitrick writes. \"The annual number of fires grew from 1959 to 1990, peaking in 1989 at just over 12,000 that year, and has been trending down since. From 2017 to 2021 (the most recent interval available), there were about 5,500 fires per year, half the average from 1987 to 1991.\"<br/><url normalizedValue=\"/media/images/2023/sizes/480w/CanadaFires2.jpg\"> Link to Image </url><br/>The overall number of fires shows a similar, declining trend in the U.S. over the past 30 years, but the acreage burned has increased.<br/>A June 2023 Congressional Research Service \"report\" explains, \"The number of annual wildfires is variable but has decreased slightly over the last 30 years.\" The same report notes that \"the number of acres affected annually, while also variable, generally has increased.\" Research Service authors write, \"Since 2000, an annual average of 70,025 wildfires have burned an annual average of 7.0 million acres. The acreage figure is more than double the average annual acreage burned in the 1990s (3.3 million acres)\"<br/>That Congressional report cites data from the current National Interagency Fire Center website, which only shows data back to 1983. This is further than the 30-year window considered by the Congressional Research Service report. But looking at the Center's total available data does not change the overall picture appreciably.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"/media/images/2023/sizes/480w/WildfireInteragency.jpg\"> Link to Image </url><br/>The area burned is again variable, which is expected because significant fires can often escape and burn millions of acres in a dry year. Adding numbers from previous large burns can add some perspective.<br/>The largest fire recorded in the U.S. was the Miramichi Fire in Maine, in 1825, which burned 3 million acres. Four of the ten largest fires reported in the United States occurred in or before 1910. The remaining six all occurred after 2000. The most devastating forest fire is the Peshtigo Fire, which occurred in October 1871 in Wisconsin. That single fire killed over 1,200 people and burned up to 1.5 million acres.<br/>With several sources listing massive burns - more than one million acres -in the past two centuries, it's interesting that the Fire Center's data is limited to the past 40 years. For that additional information, the internet Wayback Machine is a helpful resource. A look at one past iteration of the Center's website shows that up until December 2020, the National Interagency Fire Center showed wildfire data going back to 1926. This additional data reveals a great deal about the nation's wildfire history.<br/>U.S. wildfires have dropped dramatically over the past century, both in number and total acres burned.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"/media/images/2023/sizes/480w/TotalWildfires-1983-2022.jpg\"> Link to Image </url><br/>Despite the wide variability in the fire record, forest managers and fire modeling experts who are willing to speak out have argued that climate both is and is not a major factor in wildfires. As the redacted data on the Fire Center's website indicates, our perceptions of trends in fire behavior depends on when we start counting.<br/>Published information on wildfires will often motivate trained foresters to reach out. McKitrick's Financial Post article \"prompted an interesting email...from an experienced forester,\" he noted in a June 16 Tweet.<br/>\"As someone who works in forestry and has worked fires, and been evacuated due to fire, I have looked into the data, and it bothers me to no end how 'the science' is ignored.\" They continue, \"Climate change doesn't make fires more intense, fuel loading does.\"<br/>The Mackinac Center has similar experiences. Our June piece on wildfires, \"Only who can prevent forest fires?\" explains, \"Wildfire science confirms a basic fact: Dry weather tends to dry out materials that fuel and intensify wildfires. But climate change is not to blame for this year's or any year's wildfires.\"<br/>That is the case, even though \"more and more, ostensibly settled climate science aches to point out that there's nothing climate change can't do. Whether you're worried about increasing or decreasing temperatures, increasing or decreasing precipitation, increasing or decreasing wildfires, climate change appears to have you covered.\" But \"forest management policies play the key role in determining whether wildfires increase or decrease in number and intensity.\"<br/>We've received emails from foresters who say they agree with our forestry work. Refusing to allow active management and failing to suppress fires immediately have heightened fuel loading conditions. Heavy fuel loads ensure that, when a fire does start, and fire crews are not immediately able to stop it, it is likely to explode into an intense conflagration that burns everything.<br/>These massive fires can effectively take areas back to the earliest of seral stages-bare mineral soil conditions, similar to when the glaciers retreated. From there, it can take decades for the land to transition from mineral soil back to grasses, to shrubs, and then to trees and forests.<br/>People should be skeptical about the climate change hysteria that reemerges during every wildfire season. Instead, they should focus on active forest management practices, including harvesting, spacing and thinning, as well as prescribed fires. These practices implemented prior to dry years would reduce fuel loading and lessen the likelihood of a major fire. This would do far more to protect forested lands than locking them up in preserves and hoping lightning never strikes.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-187751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68P5-0P71-DYY9-04KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 Mackinac Center, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mackinac Center For Public Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 12, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The small Canadian town sits at the confluence of two rivers and was built on one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas in North America-the Nlaka'pamux people have called it home for more than 10,000 years. About 250 people lived in the Lytton of the recent past, on a few cross streets and several dozen lots-you could take it in all in one breath. One blistering June evening in 2021, a wildfire burned through the entire place, and the neighboring Lytton First Nation.</p><p><br/>Patrick Michell, the former chief of a nearby Nlaka'pamux community, was at the band office when he got a succession of texts from his wife in the span of minutes: Somebody just called and said Lytton is burning. Then, Our reserve is on fire, and then: Our house is on fire. After that, the cell service cut out. In the hours that followed, roughly 1,000 people were evacuated; two people died. Ninety percent of the town of Lytton was destroyed, as were dozens of homes and community buildings across Lytton First Nation. The hundreds of residents who lost their homes scattered across British Columbia.<br/>Less than a week after the blaze, the province's then-premier, John Horgan, pledged his government's support to help Lytton rebuild as a \"town of tomorrow,\" more resilient to future climate-change challenges. More than two years later, that tomorrow still hasn't arrived. The first residential-building permit was issued last month, and the town had remained under a state of local emergency until June, which meant that residents were prohibited from setting foot there. The plan that the village council initially offered-to become a model of minimizing carbon emissions-wasn't the plan that many residents wanted, either. They didn't want to live in the town of tomorrow. They just wanted to come home.<br/>This idea of rebuilding to meet the climate of the future is becoming conventional wisdom among disaster-recovery experts, and it makes sense: What were once record-breaking weather events are becoming routine. So why wouldn't we want to prepare for the worst-case scenario while building back in ways that don't make the problem worse? The day before the fire, Lytton's temperature had crept to 121.3 degrees Fahrenheit, the hottest ever recorded in Canada; high winds and a once-in-10,000-year heat dome, virtually impossible without human-caused climate change, helped create the tinderboxlike conditions for the town's quick and near-total devastation. This summer, Canada endured its worst wildfire season ever, with the most land burned in the country's recorded history. More than 6,700 blazes have burned roughly 45.7 million acres of land-an area larger than Washington State-and even now, in December, more than 200 fires are burning, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In August, multiple fires burned across British Columbia, surrounding Lytton First Nation and the village. Nearly 200,000 Canadians were placed under an evacuation order this year and 30,000 in British Columbia alone this summer; some members of Lytton First Nation who fled in 2021 were forced to evacuate yet again.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/11/climate-change-policies-contradictions/675967/?utm_source=feed\">Read: One huge contradiction is undoing our best climate efforts</url>]<br/>As these fires burned, Canada wrestled with the limits of its disaster-response approach. Without a national body akin to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the U.S., Canada's patchwork approach involves the military and three levels of government on a case-by-case basis, with the affected locality usually taking the lead. \"In Canada, we're not going to have somebody thousands of miles away tell me how to fix my community,\" Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, in Canada, told me. Historically, recovery after flooding or wildfire has also been more reliant on the private sector. There's an expectation that the pockets of affected homeowners will get what they need through their insurance, Sara Shneiderman, a professor of anthropology and public policy and a co-lead of the Disaster Resilience Research Network at the University of British Columbia, told me: \"But because of climate change, we're seeing that it can be this mass-scale devastation, which means you need a very different kind of approach.\"<br/>In Canada, disaster recovery is flexible by design, but flexibility, as Lytton learned, can look like having no plan at all. Many people lost their home, their pets, and anything they were unable to take with them at a moment's notice. The year of the fire, a third of Lytton's residents were 65 and older, likely retired and living on fixed incomes, and less than half of the town was adequately insured. Most of the town's infrastructure and services burned. Lytton also lost its governance records, bylaws, and policies when its server and backup server burned. A model that focuses on local knowledge and autonomy, Kovacs admitted, wasn't well suited for a town where \"nobody had a home, and nobody could get to work-there was no one to do it.\"<br/>Everything that had given Lytton its charm before the fire had now become a liability. Lytton's mayor, its small staff, and the small village council, elected uncontested and used to handling wastewater treatment and other day-to-day issues, were ill-equipped to deal with high-level crisis communications or to reconstruct a town. What's more, Lytton was broke-its tiny tax base had been decimated and could not fund the removal of toxic dirt and debris, let alone a complete rebuild. Bringing in consultants, experts, and construction workers to help with the recovery was a challenge too, in part because of the town's small size and relative isolation, and because of the remote area's limited accommodations. On top of all of this, not long after the fire, heavy rains, atmospheric floods, and snowstorms left many of the region's main arteries impassable for extended periods.<br/>Lytton was on its own. The provincial government provided initial recovery funding, but for months, the only support offered to residents was a $2,000 payout. As the council struggled behind closed doors to come up with a plan, residents saw little opportunity to offer input. After months of pressure from their constituents, the council asked for more direct support from the province; in October 2021, the town finally announced a short-term recovery plan and hired a recovery team using provincial money. In December 2021, residents started getting $1,300 a month for interim housing.<br/>But within a month of the fire-without officially consulting the community-the mayor had already announced to the media that Lytton would be rebuilt as a carbon-neutral town. Residents were mystified and infuriated in equal measure. \"It would be fine to do something like this if you were planning a brand-new subdivision,\" Denise O'Connor, a lifelong Lytton resident and a former school principal, told me in October 2022. \"But when you're in a disaster, it doesn't make sense  There's been zero sense of urgency for the people.\"<br/>The initial plans required residents to rebuild their homes to net-zero standards for heating and cooling. The council also considered installing power lines belowground to minimize fire risk, as well as solar sidewalks-hardened solar panels fitted into sidewalks-and wind turbines to power municipal buildings. When I asked Jan Polderman, who was mayor at the time, what prompted this decision, he told me the council had looked at the available provincial and federal grant funding, and seen money for sustainable and net-zero initiatives. \"Working towards being net-zero and fire-resilient-obviously, after that type of fire, that's a pretty high priority-was the best route to go for the next 100 years,\" Polderman said. Plus, because the city of Vancouver is aiming to require net-zero buildings by 2032, \"we pitched the [provincial] government to use Lytton as a test model so that by the time Vancouver and Kelowna have to go net-zero, they have proven technology to use,\" he told me. The council had a nice story to tell about the long-term benefits of building back better from a devastating climate disaster. But all residents heard was that it was going to take far longer to move home.<br/>Some of their neighbors were already rebuilding. Tricia Thorpe and her husband lost everything in the fire, but because their farm was located outside Lytton proper, they were exempt from the village's rebuilding rules. \"It's a silver lining that we fell through the cracks. Otherwise, we'd still be waiting to rebuild,\" Thorpe told me. They weren't insured, so they relied on crowdfunding, donations, and volunteer labor. \"We're trying to be as energy efficient and fire resistant as we can,\" Thorpe said. The property's electrical lines run underground from a stand-alone shed to the house; the house and the barn have cement cladding, metal siding, and metal roofs to improve fire resistance; sprinklers cover their property's southeast side, the direction from which another fire would most likely blow in. They put in a heat pump, have radiant floor heating, and are planning to get solar panels as soon as they can afford them.<br/>Meanwhile, a major chunk of federal and provincial funding for Lytton took until 2022 to come through; the federal government launched its homeowner grant program only this past May.  People in the Lytton area can apply for grants of $10,000 toward rebuilding to fire-resilient standards and, depending on home size, about $84,000 to rebuild to net-zero standards-using solar panels or better-insulated walls and roofs, as well as thicker, more airtight windows.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/ira-climate-bill-discounts-home-electrification/675013/?utm_source=feed\">Read: I turned my house into a zero-carbon utopia</url>]<br/>It's a good policy in principle, Ali Asgary, a professor of disaster and emergency management at Toronto's York University, told me: \"We want to rebuild in a way that buildings and infrastructure receive less damage and cause no death during future similar events.\" But the net-zero requirements go beyond that-and some in Lytton struggle to see why they have to jump through these extra hoops to get help. \"Sure, it might be a positive thing to be a model community that helps plan for others in the future,\" Shneiderman, of the Disaster Resilience Research Network, said. \"But that's not necessarily serving the needs of the people who are actually there.\"<br/>In the months following the fire, lacking information and any sense of when they'd be back home, residents grew discontented. Some, like Thorpe, believe that the plans for Lytton to become carbon neutral were a PR move more than anything else. One council member resigned; recovery managers came and went. On Facebook, people shared what little information they had and vented. After uproar from residents, the council softened some of the other proposed green-building regulations; any official talk of solar sidewalks stopped. But by then, it was too late-goodwill had been lost. In large part because of her frustration with the net-zero standards, O'Connor ran for mayor, and won.<br/> A big problem with the current net-zero grants, she told me, is the number of boxes residents must tick to qualify-you can't meet just some of the requirements; it's all or nothing. And because most of the federal grant money would only be paid at the end of the rebuild, some people are forgoing the grants, O'Connor told me. In December 2023, a Canadian insurer, in partnership with the federal government, did offer to advance residents the money to rebuild to fire-resilient and net-zero standards. But this process has gone on for long enough that some people have already decided against moving back to town at all. When the village council polled former residents this past April, before the announcement of the federal and insurance funding, 65 percent of households that had relocated planned on moving back to Lytton. And although 60 percent said that they would rebuild to fire-resilient standards, only 13 percent were planning to rebuild with net-zero standards in mind.<br/>For two years, Lytton was an eerie collection of signifiers that a town once thrived here: cracked sidewalks and intact metal fences; the bones of a concrete building that had once been a health clinic; a small cemetery that was still recognizable; a set of burnt, misshapen plastic Adirondack chairs on someone's lawn. As recently as this fall, recovery workers were still clearing debris, cleaning the soil of toxins, and working to uncover thousands of Indigenous artifacts, including a 7,500-year-old spear point, copper grave goods, tools, and red ochre wrapped in birch bark, which was central to ancestral burials-another stumbling block along the long road to the Lytton of tomorrow. As of this writing, no homes have been built.<br/>In contrast to the town of Lytton, the neighboring Lytton First Nation's recovery has moved more swiftly. Its losses were less total than the village's, and it works directly with Indigenous Services Canada, which has separate funding. Although many still feel that the Lytton First Nation recovery is lacking, last summer, the Nation set up temporary housing, which meant that Michell-now Lytton First Nation's rebuild director-and others were able to come home while they waited to rebuild on their lots. Their rebuilding plan includes a mix of prefab homes and homes made of wood and constructed on-site, with a focus on climate resilience, done their own way. They are cognizant of fire: This summer, Michell, still living in temporary housing on Lytton First Nation and told that he could have to evacuate for nearby fires at any moment, was out every day, cutting his neighbours' grass, making sure everything was as fire safe as it could be. He called himself a climate refugee. \"Three years of wildfire-evacuation alerts and orders in Lytton, and I'm still here,\" he told me. He plans on staying, but part of him wonders how many more hits this place can take-and what the Lytton of the future could look like for his grandchildren.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-canadawildfirerebuildinglytton676947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69XX-FB01-JCG7-V1HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Each spread is a snapshot of the harrowing adventures of the family traveling, hunting, and finding shelter. Ultimately our young heroine, in a cave, discovers drawing and telling a story. One dramatic spread shows the family trailing the side of a mountain path; the following spread discreetly shows the death of one member in a rockslide, feet still visible. The story ends with a fictionalized epilogue, written originally in Spanish and translated into English, about the young girl who discovers cave drawing becoming a leader of the clan. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> Recommended as a read-along within a group or with a caregiver, the book will be of even further benefit if accompanied by explanation of the Pleistocene era.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014This fanciful tale of a tiny boy whose entire life must be modified to accommodate his diminutive stature sends an affirming message about embracing one's unique qualities. Little Pea is so small, he sleeps in a matchbox and learns to swim in the bathroom sink. He is blissfully unaware that his size might ever present a problem until he goes to school and can't participate in activities like the other students. Despite loneliness, he finds solace in art and ultimately carves out a fulfilling life for himself illustrating postage stamps. The text and illustrations frequently demonstrate a playful juxtaposition: \"As he got older, he wrestled bears\" (the bears are teddy bears) \"and raced his own car\" (the car is a toy car). Illustrations rendered in a soft pastel color palette complement the gentle tone of the narrative. As in William Joyce's George Shrinks, the story never lingers on conflict or sadness, which may be reassuring to sensitive readers. Little Pea and all other characters are white-presenting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> This sweetly quirky story with uplifting themes is a cozy read-aloud and will be a welcome purchase for larger collections.\u2014Allison Tran</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gr 1\u20133</emphasis>\u2014In this largely wordless picture book, a crow is attempting to make its own room in a corner. The corner is gray and drab. The crow starts out with a bed, a plant, and a bookshelf; it gradually expands to fill the space with additional artwork and objects. However, the crow still feels lonely and in the ending pages, cuts a window and meets another bird. The drawings are sparse; shading and cross-hatching in color pencil add a charming element to the illustrations. The few sentences are simple short phrases showing the progression of the crow realizing that it isn't more objects it needs, but companionship. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> Recommended purchase for those looking for high design and charming picture books about friendship and community-building.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014Young Nika has a secret, and she's afraid of judgment and criticism from others. This secret weighs on her so heavily, it interferes with her daily life\u2014until she discovers that her burden grows lighter when she shares it with a friend. Reassuring themes of empathy, self-compassion, and communication are conveyed through straightforward, all-caps prose crafted in short sentences. The visuals in this book are particularly striking, with large illustrations rendered in crayon and paint, evoking a childlike drawing style. An effective use of color conveys mood\u2014red to indicate anger and blue to imply sadness\u2014with creative interplay between the text and illustrations, as in one spread where the phrase \"IT IS A VERY HEAVY SECRET\" literally bears down on a crouching Nika. Between the expressive illustrations and the story's encouraging message, readers will find much comfort here. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> Readers will relate to this book's affirming themes and eye-catching illustrations, making it a first purchase for picture book collections and an especially good choice for story hours about feelings.\u2014Allison Tran</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">K-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014A young girl learns to embrace her differences in this quirky illustrated book for young readers. As the title suggests, Lenore was born with a big green hand. Embarrassed and frustrated by this oddity, she tries to hide her hand by wrapping it in a scarf, only to get the surprise of her life when the hand starts talking to her. As it turns out, the hand, Chuck, wasn't thrilled to be stuck to a small pink blob, and recounts his adventurous attempt to escape. Ultimately, Chuck and Lenore realize they're in this world together and choose to recognize the value in each other's existence in a conclusion that offers an uplifting message about living with a physical difference or what others may conventionally perceive to be a disability. The surreal tone of this story is sure to elicit giggles from children. At the same time, it may spark important discussions about differences and empathy. Divided into short chapters, each page of this book features just one or two sentences accompanying a single illustration. Expressive pencil drawings mimic the look of children's artwork. Color is used effectively throughout the story: Visuals are initially rendered in gray scale with the occasional pop of green, but as Chuck and Lenore discover the beauty of seeing the world anew, soft pastels bloom on the pages. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> This book is undeniably weird but beautiful, imparting an priceless and enduring message about accepting differences and seeing with others' perspectives.\u2014Allison Tran</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gr 2\u20135</emphasis>\u2014Dive into simple machines, shenanigans, and family with this STEM-based picture book about a young girl named Mazie who loves to try to engineer her family's problems away. While her inventions aren't always the perfect solution she sought, her optimism and the support of her family throughout provide an uplifting, science-specific accompaniment to other popular picture books such as those in the \"Questioneers\" series. The stamped and graphite-based illustrations are reminiscent of 2010s cartoon series and provide a welcoming flatness that allows young readers to slip into each panel and action-driven step with Mazie. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> While the flow of the text is not particularly dynamic, the STEM tie-ins and breakdown of simple machines in the back matter make this a good choice for classroom activities and for readers who love unpacking the secret science woven into illustrations.\u2014Aryssa Damron</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 1</emphasis>\u2014In this lavishly illustrated wordless book, a young child plays in a treehouse and has a magical afternoon with a family of extraterrestrial beings. The human child and the extraterrestrial child are not gendered; both sets of parents are clearly cued as mothers and fathers. Most of the spreads follow the human child looking in awe and exploring the bucolic world of the treehouse and the surrounding lands. Through the child's wandering, readers meet the visiting family of extraterrestrials, drawn as celestial heads, bodies, torsos, legs, and segmented arms. Ultimately the extraterrestrial and the human become fast friends, playing with each other and trading stories. The full-color artwork has scultural shading and shadowing in a realm of round shapes and few sharp angles. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis>S Recommended for libraries looking for books with diverse representations and about curiosity and friendship.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014Readers will be captivated by this retelling of a South American fable that encourages determination and cooperation. A fire threatens to destroy a majestic rainforest that a wide of variety of animals calls home. Armadillos, elephants, and jaguars flee to safety, but a small hummingbird stays to do everything she can to combat the flames, ultimately inspiring the other creatures to follow suit. The story of the hummingbird's bravery unfolds in lyrical prose that maintains a distant formality well-suited for a fable, inviting read-alouds in reverent tones. The drama of the forest fire plays out in vivid spreads featuring lush digital illustrations, bold enough to be eye-catching at a distance and intricately detailed up close. Back matter includes a guide to the global habitats of the animals depicted in the story, interesting facts about hummingbirds, and notes from both the author and artist. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> A beautifully told fable with uplifting themes and a timely environmental message. Purchase where folktales are popular.\u2014Allison Tran</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014A slow-paced cozy adventure of an anthropomorphized pig heading north to drive over a bridge, stalled by a wolf who tells the pig that the bridge is broken. The pig goes home with the wolf to have coffee and snacks with his wolf partner and ends with the pig driving off to discover that the bridge does not exist. The story is told completely in narrative, with implied conversation by text placed in proximity to the animal speaking. The artwork is a charming full-color flat drawings of deliberately limited dimensionality, set at the end of winter when patches of snow are visible. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> A book that opens like a fairy tale and ends more like an existential question, this is recommended as an additional purchase, for its poetic setting and pacing.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">K-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014Rosie is a racing greyhound who manages to escape the racetrack and find a park to be with other dogs. During her magical escape, she zooms in a manic flight through a circus, houses, subways, the ocean, etc. to finally find a safe place to be herself. The book is told through full-color spreads and vignettes with facing images. The text is largely descriptive with Rosie's point of view told in the third person until the very end, when she meets other dogs. Diversity of people in this story is shown with gestural representations of the audience of crowds using color. The rough pastel drawings are beguiling and through sketched gestures show the speed of Rosie moving through the landscape. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> Where dog stories are popular, or books in translation, this is a recommended purchase for its blissful adventure of Rosie the dog.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014A little girl can't be a tiger\u2014or can she? When Saira views a nature documentary about these big cats, she immediately feels a kinship and decides she's a tiger, too. Undaunted by naysayers, this sassy young girl roars and prowls with glee, influencing other classmates to join the fun. When she tries to convince her mother that tigers don't have a bedtime, however, her clever mom surprises her with some tiger facts of her own. Brimming with creativity and humor, this affirming tale will resonate with imaginative readers, and the sheer amount of roaring throughout the story makes it a terrific selection for story hour. Along with reporting Saira's antics, the narrative offers gentle encouragement for adults to lovingly support their children's choices and explorations as they grow. The book's quirky lettering style can make the prose challenging to read, but the big, bold collage illustrations are rich in detail and well-suited to the story's themes of self-confidence and empowerment. With a positive representation of diverse main characters\u2014Saira and her mom are brown-skinned\u2014there is a wide range of skin tones among the book's supporting cast as well. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> An uplifting read for kids with big imaginations, this title is a welcome purchase for most picture book collections.\u2014Allison Tran</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">K-Gr 3</emphasis>\u2014A colorful, slightly spooky rumination on animals that go bump in the night and a child's imagination. The bulk of the book focuses on the animal kingdom at night, from the tiniest things that glow in the dark to nocturnal owls and tigers that prowl for food, then returns to the bedroom where the imaginative element is at play. The gouache, watercolor, and ink illustrations are engaging, lush, and equally creative as the text: children will recognize the animals but be excited by the way the illustrations move and prowl like the creatures themselves. The opening is somewhat slow to hook readers, but then the prose builds beautifully in wave after wave. That may make this less useful at bedtime. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> This blue-hued picture book is a great read-aloud for animal lovers and kids who have enjoyed Where the Wild Things Are.\u2014Aryssa Damron</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PreS-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014In this picture book originally published in Spanish, jabiru storks are used as a metaphor to show the variety of human social groupings. For each spread, jabiru storks are shown as a two-dimensional drawing against a flat natural backdrop with a single sentence describing both the storks and a human experience. One spread describes different family groupings, including eggs and chickling jabirus; another describes the passing of jabirus, all using a limited vocabulary. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> Recommended as an additional purchase for libraries to show different familial structures, how these structures can change and how each of us follows our own path.\u2014Vi Ha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">K-Gr 2</emphasis>\u2014Keyana is a fun-loving girl with big plans for the ultimate sleepover when her old friend, Nia, comes to visit after moving away. With a detailed list of all their old favorites planned, what could possibly go wrong? But the girls can't seem to agree on anything and bickering ensues. The issue isn't as simple as what snack or whether to ride scooters or bikes for Keyana. Will Nia move on without her? This is a great book to show successful conflict resolution. Giving students an opportunity to see the importance of looking at both sides and trying new things will have them making connections to reflect on their own relationships. Barlow's illustrations, featuring Black and brown characters in cozy domestic scenes, add great detail to the story with pastel hues of watercolor that are calming. Readers will want to pack their pajamas and join the sleepover too. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VERDICT</emphasis> This is a strong addition to any SEL collection specific to conflict resolution and perfect for elementary school libraries.\u2014Darla Kaminsky</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLJREV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLJREV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B13-H9M1-JBPJ-10T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256569</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Library Journals, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>School Library Journal Reviews</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15157\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 69</volume><issueNumber>No. 12</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 22, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL67</classCode><className>PREHISTORIC LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL68</classCode><className>DRAWING &amp; ILLUSTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009P1K</classCode><className>SCHOOL LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DSO5</classCode><className>LONELINESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>N519120MM</classCode><className>LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL68</classCode><className>DRAWING &amp; ILLUSTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009P1K</classCode><className>SCHOOL LIBRARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

After the worst year to date in 2019, 2020 was another year in which fires burnt large areas of natural land in Europe. Despite the increased level of preparedness in EU countries, about 340,000 hectares (ha) were burnt in the EU in 2020 - an area 30% larger than Luxembourg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2021 fire season is even worse. By the release of this report, some 0.5 million ha have already gone up in flames, 61% being forests that will take years to recover. About 25% of the zones burnt in Europe were inside the 'Natura 2000' sites - the EU reservoirs of biodiversity. The EU has reinforced its capacity this year to assist countries this fire season, and has already been used extensively for the large fires that hit the Mediterranean region this summer.</p><p>Climate change is more noticeable every year too. A clearly observable increasing trend shows higher levels of fire danger, longer fire seasons and intense fast-spreading 'mega fires', on which traditional firefighting means have little power. This year, about 130,000 ha were already burnt by the end of June, which marks the traditional start of the fire season. Fires no longer affect southern states only, but are a growing threat also for central and northern Europe. More than nine out of 10 fires in the EU are caused by human actions. Therefore, public awareness and educational campaigns about the risk of fires are key to prevent disasters.</p><p>Key findings of the report</p><p>* The 2020 report on forest fires shows that Romania was the most affected country, followed by Portugal, Spain and Italy, as per national reporting;</p><p>* Wildfires heavily affected Europe's Natura 2000 protected areas: counting for 136,331 ha - about 40% of the total burnt area in 2020 - slightly less than in 2019 but above the average of the past 9 years;</p><p>* As in 2019, unfortunately, Romania accounted again for almost half of the burnt area in Natura 2000 sites, mostly in the Delta Danube Nature Reserve;</p><p>* In 2020, fires of over 30 ha affected 20 EU Member States, burning 339,489 ha in total, which is slightly above the amount recorded in 2019;</p><p>* More people have lost their lives in the 2020 fire season than in 2019 also: national reporting from Spain recorded six causalities, among which, four were firefighters;</p><p>* In 2020, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service rapid mapping was activated 17 times for detailed mapping of forest fires, which is less than the activations so far in 2021;</p><p>* The EU Civil Protection Mechanismwas upgraded with a fleet of firefighting aircraft via rescEU in 2019, reinforcing its capacity to assist countries during this fire season.</p><p>The forest fire season in 2020 was characterised by a large number of wildfires during the first half of the year. Fires burned in winter over the Danube delta and in the Pyrenees, and in spring mainly in the Balkan region. During summer and autumn, the most affected were the Mediterranean countries, specifically Spain and Portugal, which recorded the largest fire events in the EU for 2020. The largest wildfires of the year occurred outside the EU, in Ukraine near the Chernobyl buried nuclear reactor.</p><p>Members of the College said:</p><p>Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, responsible for the Joint Research Centre, Mariya Gabriel, said: \"Climate change is increasing the risk and the magnitude of wildfires around the world. Since 2016, the unprecedented fires that have happened globally show a behaviour and intensity that was never experienced before. We have seen our forest growing in the EU over the last decades and we need to preserve them more than ever to heal our planet. The JRC and the European Commission are mobilising science, technologies, policies and cooperation to prevent these massive fires, safeguard our forests, preserve biodiversity and, above all, protect lives in the EU and beyond.\"</p><p>Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, said: \"Forest fires pose a significant disaster risk to the whole of Europe as well as to other parts of the world. Over the course of the past ten years, the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to more than forty large-scale forest fire emergencies. Climate change is also extending the forest fire season by several months, increasing the likelihood of more wildfire emergencies for European communities going forward. We are determined to step up all efforts to strengthen our EU-wide response to forest fires, to help prevent, prepare and respond.\"</p><p>Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said: \"Changing climate is making an impact on the length and severity of the fire season, endangering more lives and taking the toll on nature. Today's report shows how devastating the last year has been, and as shown by data from this year. The European Commission has adopted a new EU Forest Strategy to increase the resilience of forests in Europe. Healthy and resilient forests and land that is managed in a way that protects biodiversity and people is crucial to mitigate the impact of wildfires. That's why we're working with partners and national authorities to establish land-based wildfire prevention as a norm.\"</p><p>Background</p><p>The Joint Research Centre provides a key contribution to wildfire disaster risk reduction in Europe and globally, through the development and operation of the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). Under the EU Copernicus program and the Expert Group on Forest Fires (EGFF), EFFIS provides continuous monitoring from satellites of the fire situation in Europe. It provides countries with a platform for exchange of good practices on prevention, firefighting, restoration and fire management at the European level. EFFIS was used by government organisations and citizens, with nearly 300,000 users from 178 countries in 2020. EFFIS is also complemented by the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS), which extends the monitoring to the entire globe.</p><p>The Forest Fires in Europe, Middle East and North Africa reports of the JRC provide a very comprehensive overview of the situation regarding forest fires. The 2020 edition includes reports from 33 countries in the covered regions describing national fire management activities and actions taken at both national and European levels during the fire campaigns in this period.</p><p>The EU is working actively to prevent wildfires, preserve forest, recover biodiversity and save lives. In March this year, the Commission published new guidelines for prevention of wildfires, for forest and vegetation management to reduce the spread and intensity of fires, and for effective responses. Building on the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, part of the flagship initiative of the European Green Deal the Commission proposed new EU Forest Strategy for 2030, which steps up action on forest fire prevention and promotes better climate resilience.</p><p>Report: <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC126766/annual_report_2020_final_topdf.pdf\">https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC126766/annual_report_2020_final_topdf.pdf</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7651138 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7651138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63YR-R4Y1-DYG2-R3TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><timeReceived>8:41 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 30, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to the 2017 Montana Climate Assessment, the annual average temperatures in the state has increased 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950 and is projected to increase by approximately 3.0 to 7.0 degrees by midcentury. As climate change makes summers hotter and drier in the Northern Rockies, the annual forest fire season has nearly tripled since the mid-1970s, from 49 to 135 days. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) </p><p><br/>Idaho and the Northern Rockies are facing an unprecedented wave of development that is fracturing wildlife habitat, threatening water quality, and seeing vastly increased logging of our national forests under the guise of 'restoration' and wildfire prevention. <br/>There is hope, however, to keep our forests standing, our wildlife healthy in secure and connected habitat, and ensure clean, cold water continues to pour from our mountain headwater streams and rivers. The last best chance for the last best place is the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, which has just been introduced in the U.S. Senate as S.1531[1], by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and already has 11 Senate co-sponsors. <br/>As more scientists and policy-makers understand every day, keeping our forests and the ecosystems they support intact is the nation's best, cheapest, and most efficient way to combat the increasingly dire effects of climate change. <br/>That's what the act does by designating all of the remaining Inventoried Roadless Areas in the Northern Rockies as Wilderness, which would extend the nation's highest level of land and water protection to approximately 23 million acres of public land in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Wyoming. <br/>Water is the lifeblood of the West and protecting the forests that shade mountain snowpack slows melting, which keeps water available for downstream use until later in the season when it is most needed. This is especially critical given the longer, hotter and drier summers the Northern Rockies are now experiencing. <br/>The act also designates about 1,800 miles of rivers and streams as Wild and Scenic Rivers[2], which will protect them from the ongoing rush of streamside development that results in sedimentation from bank erosion and nutrient pollution from septic systems. Keeping rivers and streams clean provides obvious benefits for our legendary Rocky Mountain fisheries and riverine ecosystems, but cleaner source water also translates into significant savings for municipal water treatment plants and higher quality water for citizens. <br/>Much like the great work done by the revered Civilian Conservation Corps[3], the act will also put thousands of people to work. It will restore over one million acres of habitat and watersheds damaged by past logging as well as removing 6,300 miles of old, continually eroding logging roads. <br/>Despite the development pressures, the Northern Rockies remain home to almost all of the native species that were here when Lewis and Clark passed through on their expedition more than 200 years ago. The act ensures that traditional land and water migratory routes are restored for native wildlife and fish. This is especially important to threatened and endangered species such as grizzly bears, lynx, bull trout, wolverine, fisher and many other species currently facing inbreeding and extinction due to the lack of connecting corridors. <br/>The act is based on solid science, not political expediency or special interest influence. It was written by prominent scientists and residents from the Northern Rockies who live and work here, including John Craighead. who was named by National Geographic as one of the top 100 scientists of the 20th century. <br/>The Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act protects and restores the environment for native fish and wildlife, efficiently fights climate change, and creates thousands of good jobs restoring past damages. It does all this by designating existing Inventoried Roadless Areas on public lands as Wilderness. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe\">https://idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe</url><br/>The post The Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act is the last best chance for the last best place[4] appeared first on Idaho Capital Sun[5]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1276\">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1276</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rivers.gov\">https://www.rivers.gov</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-civilian-conservation-corps.htm#:~:text=Roosevelt%20established%20the%20Civilian%20Conservation,lands%2C%20forests%2C%20and%20parks\">https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-civilian-conservation-corps.htm#:~:text=Roosevelt%20established%20the%20Civilian%20Conservation,lands%2C%20forests%2C%20and%20parks</url>.

Scientific volunteers from three Chilean universities collaborating on a marshland restoration project within the Rano Raruku volcano made the rare find.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The laguna, or lake, within the volcano began to dry up in 2018, a member of the Ma\u2019u Henua community, which manages the Rapa Nui national park where the volcano is located, told The Guardian.</p><p>The statue is just over five feet tall and was found lying down on its side. Researchers told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS6emeUYG4Q\">Good Morning America</url> it's a smaller statue and they will likely use carbon-14 dating to figure out how old it is.</p><p>Called moai, the centuries-old statues are part of a Polynesian tradition to honor ancestors, Terry Hunt, an archaeologist from the University of Arizona, told Good Morning America.</p><p>\"There have been no moai ... found in the dry bed or in what was previously a lake, so this is a first,\" Hunt said.</p><p>The statues have distinct, long faces and no legs; many were made from volcanic ash and are located near fresh water on the island.</p><p>The island's tallest moai statue is 33 feet tall; they typically weigh around three to five tons but can weigh up to 80, Hunt said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Egypt:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/02/01/egypt-embalming-recipe-mummies/11156181002/\">Ancient Egyptian embalming fluids \u2014 researchers decipher the recipe to preserve mummies</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hercules:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/10/07/hercules-statue-discovered-ancient-greek-city/8195021001/\">Larger-than-life, 2,000-year-old Hercules statue discovered in Greece</url></p><h>Moai represent ancestors and connect generations</h><p>Moai statues represent ancestors who have passed on, community elder Maria Elena Hotu told <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/travel/story/gma-gets-1st-new-moai-statue-found-easter-97457249\">Good Morning America</url>. They create connections between current generations and their ancestors.</p><p>According to oral tradition passed down among the island's people, the heavy statues walked themselves, Hunt said.</p><p>Today, islanders use rope and their own collective strength to move the moai from side to side, to make them appear as if they are walking forward.</p><p>The recently discovered moai was \u201cfull-bodied with recognisable features but no clear definition,\" according to a statement from the Ma\u2019u Henua Indigenous Community given to The Guardian.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really unique discovery as it\u2019s the first time that a moai has been discovered inside a laguna in a Rano Raraku crater,\u201d the statement said.</p><p>How has climate change impacted moai statues?</p><p>Researchers believe climate-induced changes drying the lake led to this most recent discovery. These changes created an \"unusual opportunity\" to study the area, Hunt told Good Morning America.</p><p>There are nearly 1,000 moai in the area and several have been impacted by charring after a forest fire on the island in October, according to The Guardian.</p><p>With strong storms and subsequent droughts \"and exposure to the elements in general, the statues will weather faster,\" Hunt told Good Morning America.</p><p>Good Morning America also reported rising sea levels have sped up the erosion process along the coast, where moai statues stand and watch over the island.</p><p>The outlet said islanders are building a retaining wall to help prevent future damage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

The Government of Canada is investing in revitalizing our forest ecosystems including by planting two billion trees. As part of this initiative, communities and industries from coast to coast to coast are raising saplings, planting trees and bringing innovative technologies to the table.</p><p>Remotely piloted aircraft systems, such as drones, are used in various sectors across our economy, from delivery methods to search and rescue operations. Now, they are making their mark in Canada's forest sector.</p><p>Today, Peter Fonseca, Member of Parliament for Mississauga EastCooksville, on behalf of the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, announced a contribution of over $1.3 million to Flash Forest, a company that uses drone technology for tree planting. A total of over one million trees are set to be planted by Flash Forest over the next two years.</p><p>Using new technology in an effort to innovate and improve tree-planting initiatives in Canada, Flash Forest uses drones, advanced seed pods, automation and machine learning to plant in some of the most severe forest fire sites across Canada.</p><p>The sites will be monitored for germination success and to obtain survival data on the success of using drones for planting instead of traditional tree-planting methods. The project will use rapid drone deployment technology using AI, biological seed pods and robotic process automation to improve germination and the survival of temperate and boreal tree species in Canada.</p><p>Once seed pods are planted, forest growth will be monitored over consecutive seasons. The reforestation method employed by Flash Forest, which aims to plant at least 10 times faster than traditional methods and significantly cut costs, allows for rapid post-wildfire response within months of the fire, higher biodiversity and data-driven ecosystem restoration.</p><p>The federal contribution is made through the 2 Billion Trees program (2BT), which supports tree-planting projects with the aim of planting two billion trees over 10 years and helps to advance the nature-based solutions needed to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125541898</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66T3-VT81-DYTH-G32X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 13, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
