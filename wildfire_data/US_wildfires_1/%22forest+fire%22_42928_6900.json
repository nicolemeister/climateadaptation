In any case, much has changed and The Forward is very much aware that its readership today is as much as a quarter right-of-center, including some Ultra-Orthodox... who are not right-of-center, but just garden variety fascist. Fascists have rallied behind Marjorie Taylor Greene and have painted her in the bright hues of a martyr to their world of grievances. So how would The Forward handle her recent  &lt; &gt;foray into inevitable, classic anti-Semitism[1] &lt;/ &gt;?</p><p> After all, a right-wing evangelical group, Christians United for Israel, just called[2] for GOP leaders to \"condemn all those who traffic in antisemitic tropes\" and remove Greene from committees pending a full review of her past statements, and the Republican Jewish Coalition called her latest conspiracy theory \"indefensible and unacceptable[3]\" while the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations-- which includes right-wing groups like AIPAC and American Friends of Likud-- called for a \"swift and commensurate response[4]\" from congressional leaders. Would the Forward revert to its usual on-the-other-handism? On Friday, PJ Grisar warned Forward readers that Greene's latest conspiracy-- the \"Jewish Lasers\"[5]-- are no laughing matter. \"Antisemitism,\" wrote Grisar, \"is a hell of a drug\" and, like many anti-Semites before her how could could she not go after the Rothschild's since, as she said, \"there are too many coincidences to ignore?\" Could Jews just roll their eyes and ignore her? Laugh it off? Grisar noted that \"Jewish Twitter was unsure of what to make of this, perhaps her most insane claim yet. Many found the premise funny-- awful tropes notwithstanding-- because, I mean, Jewish space lasers seem like something Mel Brooks promised us in the teaser for History of the World Part II[6].There's no harm in memeifying something no reasonable person could possibly believe. Is there? The laser theory resembles the original definition of a big lie, first described as a distortion of truth so outrageous no one could believe someone would be audacious enough to make it up.All it's missing to meet our current standards for the term is a sustained campaign by those in power and a precise political aim. But Greene's rise proves there are holes in the barrier between fringe, nutty beliefs and policymakers.It's one thing for Greene the private citizen to put a lie like this out into the world, it's quite another when she is a U.S. representative. And to dismiss these pre-office musings as not applicable now is to miss the power of the online lobby that elevated her to Congress to begin with. It's a cohort that, like their champion, buys into Trump's big election lie, believes the elite subsist on baby blood, is obsessed with Jewish control and questions whether jet fuel can melt steel beams.Conspiracy theories, both bizarrely novel and steeped in centuries of prejudice, now have a voice in government. We need only look to the life of the man[7] who coined the term 'big lie' to see the dangers of that arrangement.But that's why I think poking fun at these conspiracy theories-- or challenging them with facts-- is actually imperative.Jew lasers and notions like it can and should be laughed out of town, before they make their way to the Capitol. The Forward also decided it was time to do an update on the Rothschild's-- a where are they today[8] kind of thing. One married Paris Hilton's sister, Nicky. \"Another is an environmental activist in Santa Monica, California who crossed the Pacific Ocean[9] in Plastiki, a craft made of recycled plastic bottles. Another tragically died just two weeks ago at age 57. They invest, run business interests, donate generously to a variety of causes, and not one of them has ever caused a forest fire with laser beams. Today's Rothschilds aren't as rich as Bezos and Gates, but they still command the attention of antisemites and conspiracy mongers... The Rothschild family has featured heavily in antisemitic conspiracy theories since at least the 19th century. If you believed the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the past, you'd think the family caused both Communism and capitalism, World War I and II, 9/11, the recent Malaysian Air disaster and-- oh, they sank the Titanic.\" At the same time the editors of The Forward were figuring out how to deal with the newest GOP super-star, the Washington Post was publishing an unambivalent column by Kathleen Parker, The GOP Isn't Doomed; It's Dead[10]. \"With the electoral eviction of Donald Trump from the Oval Office,\" she wrote, \"Republicans had a shot at redemption and resurrection. They missed and failed-- and deserve to spend the next several years in political purgatory. The chaos now enveloping what's left of the Grand Old Party after four years of catering to an unstable president is theirs to own. Where conservatism once served as a moderating force-- gently braking liberalism's boundless enthusiasm-- the former home of ordered liberty has become a halfway house for ruffians, insurrectionists and renegade-warriors... The party's end was inevitable, foreshadowed in 2008 when little-boy Republican males, dazzled by the pretty, born-again, pro-life Alaska governor, thought Sarah Palin should be a heartbeat away from the presidency. The dumbing down of conservatism, in other words, began its terminal-velocity plunge, with a wink and a pair of shiny red shoes. Palin cast a spell as potent as the poppy fields of Oz, but turned the United States into her own moose-poppin,' gum-smackin' reality show. Forget Kansas. We're not in America anymore.\" The road from Palin to Taylor Greene (or Mad Cawthorn or Lauren Boebert) could have been predicted... but wasn't. \"Suddenly,\" wrote Parker, \"the 'good ones are worried about their newest member, Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a QAnon-promoting female version of Trump-- only without the charm. You begin to see how this monster mutates like a certain virus into ever-more-dangerous versions of itself.'\" Going forward, not only will House Republicans be associated with a colleague who 'liked' a Twitter post calling for Speaker Nancy Pelosi's murder[11]. They'll be attached to QAnon, which promotes the extraordinary fiction that Trump was leading a war against Satan-worshiping pedophiles and cannibals, whose leadership includes [12]Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks and, oh, by the way, yours truly, as well as U2's Bono[13].To those Republicans who can read: You own all of this. The party isn't doomed; it's dead. The chance to move away from Trumpism, toward a more respectful, civilized approach to governance that acknowledges the realities of a diverse nation and that doesn't surrender to the clenched fist, has slipped away. What comes next is anybody's guess. But anyone who doesn't speak out against the myths and lies of fringe groups, domestic terrorists and demagogues such as Trump deserves only defeat-- and a lengthy exile in infamy. Good riddance.

Gavin Newsom[5]. <br/>Also on the yes side: Lyft, but also some of the unions that vociferously opposed the rideshare giant's 2020 ballot measure to rewrite state labor law[6]. On the other: the California GOP and its longtime political nemesis, the California Teachers Association. <br/>And depending on which campaign you believe, this is either a taxpayer-funded handout for a single corporation \u2014 or a climate-saving spending package opposed by billionaires who don't want to pay higher taxes. Or neither. <br/>If you're still undecided on Prop. 30 \u2014 or just curious about how it would work \u2014 we've boiled it down to 15 key numbers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>35,000 <br/>The approximate number of Californians who earned more than $2 million a year in 2019 and would therefore have to pay up if Prop. 30 passes at last count, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Analysts say the number is now probably greater than 40,000. You've heard of 'the 1%'? This is an even more rarified set than that: The 0.2%. <br/>30% <br/>The rough share of the state's personal income tax revenue paid by these 0.2%-ers, according to the most recent numbers. Personal income tax isn't the only source of state money, but it's by far the largest. Looking at the entire pot of cash that state lawmakers can draw on for discretionary spending, these select hyper-rich taxpayers cough up about one-fifth. <br/>That's a selling point for backers of Prop. 30. Unless you're rich enough to plausibly be in the market for a private plane, this measure isn't going to raise your taxes. <br/>But for opponents, that narrow source of funding is exactly the problem. The highest earners tend to get the bulk of their money through their investments. Because the stock market and other financial markets soar to higher booms and sink to lower busts than the economy as a whole, the taxes they pay are notoriously volatile[7]. That, opponents argue, makes the super rich a bad source for an ongoing, long-term investment. <br/>15.05% <br/>California's new top income tax rate, if Prop. 30 passes, for as long as 20 years. <br/>That doesn't mean the highest-earning 43,000 will be forking over more than 15% of their entire princely incomes to the state. The new rate would apply only to money earned in excess of $2 million per year. <br/>Now, California's top rate, 13.3%, starts at $1 million of income, which itself was set by a 2004 ballot measure[8] taxing millionaires to fund mental health services. That's already the highest marginal tax rate of any state in the country and far above the national average of 5.5%, according to the Tax Foundation[9]. But it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison. Hawaii, with the second highest top rate of 11%, for example, hits anyone with earnings above $200,000. <br/><br/>Opponents of the measure say such a high rate could chase California's wealthy \u2014 and all their cash \u2014 out of the state, which would pull the rug out from under the state budget. If that sounds familiar, critics of high taxes on the rich have been predicting an exodus of the elite for more than a decade[10]. There's never been much evidence[11] to back up that narrative. <br/>But this new record-high rate would put us in uncharted fiscal waters, especially now that federal law no longer allows taxpayers to write-off[12] as much of their state tax payments. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A sign inside a Lyft rideshare vehicle in Los Angeles. Photo by Ted Soqui, SIPA USA via Reuters<br/>$0 <br/>The amount that the proposition earmarks for Lyft. <br/>Maybe you've heard that Prop. 30 is a 'special interest carve-out' for the San Francisco-based rideshare company. That's how Newsom, the measure's most recognizable opponent, put it in an ad for the 'no' campaign[5]. <br/>Strictly speaking, that isn't true. The text of the measure[13] doesn't mention Lyft, or any company, by name. But Lyft stands to benefit. State regulators are requiring all of California's ridesharing companies[14] to go entirely emission-free by 2030, including 90% electric vehicles in their fleets. By making it cheaper and easier to buy electric cars, Prop. 30 could help Lyft meet that goal without drawing from its own corporate treasury to help its drivers comply. <br/>Hence the next number. <br/>95% <br/>The share of the 'Yes on 30' fundraising that comes from Lyft ($45 million and counting of $48 million so far). <br/>That's why opponents of the measure argue that it's a corporate giveaway. <br/>On Tuesday, the 'No on 30' campaign accused the proposition's backers of trying to hide the corporate giant's involvement by listing not 'Lyft,' but 'Lift' as its largest funder in a recent television ad. Attorneys with the 'No' campaign say they wrote to station managers across the state demanding that they 'stop airing the advertisement with the illegal disclaimer.' <br/>Steve Maviglio, a spokesperson for the Yes on 30 campaign, called the misspelling a 'typo' that was 'immediately corrected.' <br/>44 <br/>The number of people who have given more than $100,000 to the 'No' campaign so far. Their donations add up to about two-thirds of the total haul. The biggest contributors include some of California's highest earners, including Netflix founder Reed Hastings, venture capitalist Michael Moritz and Catherine Dean, chief operating officer of Govern For California[15], an organization at the center of an influential donor network and that itself has provided the effort with $250,000 in staff time. <br/>Among those top donors, at least 10 of them are billionaires, according to Forbes[16]. <br/>That's why supporters of the measure describe the opposition as funded by the California elite. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A sign for electric vehicle parking and charging in Millbrae. Photo by Martin do Nascimento, CalMatters <br/>80% <br/>The share of Prop. 30 revenues \u2014 estimated to total $3.5 billion to $5 billion a year \u2014 that is set aside to beef up the state's charging infrastructure and to provide subsidies for more people to afford electric cars. Half of that money is set aside for low-income communities. The state has already dedicated $10 billion over a five-year period on these programs. California's recently passed mandate to phase out all new sales of gas-powered cars by 2035 requires massive investments in clean energy. <br/>Here's a breakdown of what that looks like: <br/>35% of the total Prop. 30 revenue would go towards building charging stations in homes and apartments. That money will also be used for building fast-chargers in public spaces and fueling infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, buses and off-road construction equipment. 45% of all funds would go towards the state's zero-emission subsidy programs[17] meant to help make electric vehicles more affordable. Currently, eligible residents can receive as much as $7,000 or $9,500 in state subsidies, depending on the program. All programs have income limits. Prop. 30 would increase state funding for zero emission subsidy programs by $1.6 billion to $2.25 billion per year, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office[18]. This pool of money is also meant to increase access to other modes of clean transportation that don't require owning a car, including electrifying public transit, school buses and bikes. <br/>$384 million <br/>The federal funding[19] California is expected to receive over the next five years, provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, will help accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles. The money will be used to install charging stations statewide and builds on the state's $10 billion climate investment in electric vehicles. The federal money also includes $68.2 million so that 177 school buses can be replaced with electric models[20]. <br/>Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will be available through the Inflation Reduction Act,[21] where applicants can expect to receive a tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle. <br/>18% <br/>So far this year, 17.7% of all new cars sold in California were electric, according to the California Energy Commission[22]. All told, more than 1.3 million electric cars have been sold in the state. Though California is home to just 10% of all cars in the U.S., the state represents 42.6% of all new zero emission vehicle sales sold nationally. <br/>$66,000 <br/>The average price tag of a new electric car is about $66,000[23], but can range anywhere from about $28,000[24] to upwards of $160,000[25] for luxury models. <br/>The cost has steadily been decreasing as more models flood the market, but for most people, they're still out of reach. There are more than 115 electric models available, with the Chevy Bolt EV, MINI Electric and Nissan Leaf among some of the most affordable. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A prescribed burn in 2019. Photo courtesy of Lenya Quinn-Davidson, University of California Cooperative Extension/Humboldt County Prescribed Burn Association <br/>$1 billion <br/>Efforts to address wildfires would receive only 20% of the funds raised via Prop. 30, but there's plenty of ways to spend the money. The Legislative Analyst's Office[18] estimates that if approved, the proposition would likely increase wildfire response by $700 million, to about $1 billion a year. <br/>That's on top of the new state budget[26] that provides a one-time allocation of nearly $1 billion from the general fund for wildfire-related activities. <br/>Living with wildfires requires big money in California: The state has spent as much as $4 billion a year to fight wildfires, depending on the severity of the fire season. Most of that comes from the state's emergency fund. <br/>Critical to understanding how this new money might be used is to make clear the distinction between two parts of the proposition: allocating funds for 'response' and funds for 'prevention.' <br/>$26 million <br/>The per-unit cost of a new generation of firefighting helicopters[27]. Response generally means suppressing fires that have already ignited. In California, that means employing the largest civilian fleet of water and retardant-dropping aircraft[28] in the world, spinning up choppers and calling in scores of bulldozers, water trucks and nearly 8,000 firefighters and support personnel. <br/>State officials could choose to allocate the new funds to purchase more equipment that helps put out fires. Or Cal Fire could hire more personnel, an effort already underway. The state could also choose to use some of the money to better support Cal Fire's behavioral health unit to address what fire officials have called a mental health crisis[29] among hard-pressed first responders. <br/>$582 million <br/>The current state budget[30] allocates $582 million over three years for projects that either seek to prevent fires or boost the resiliency of forests to withstand blazes. <br/>It's a big chunk of the prevention piece, where researchers argue the bulk of the new money should go \u2014 doing what we can to prevent fires from starting and minimizing the size and destructive capacity of those that do. <br/>The general term for this method of fire prevention is fuels treatment, and this approach, too, is pricey and difficult to manage. Generally, the money could be spent removing things that burn \u2014 trees and brush. To make an impact, that would have to happen on a large scale. So-called mechanical thinning[31], removing vegetation by hand or with machines, is effective, but also expensive and time consuming. <br/>More efficient and cost-effective are prescribed burns[32], carefully planned and executed small fires, whose low intensity removes the more flammable plants and small trees, preserving large trees and leaving a healthier and less vulnerable landscape. <br/>There are political, bureaucratic and societal reasons that more prescribed burns aren't undertaken. And, as California remains in the grip of a devastating drought[33], there's also an ever-narrowing window to safely set trees on fire. <br/>For a variety of reasons, California is not emphasizing fuels-reduction activities. The state has conducted fuels reduction projects[34] on only 4,000 acres this year. Its much-touted agreement with the U.S. Forest Service[35] pledging to collectively 'treat' one millon acres in the state by 2025 has not come close to getting there. <br/>Should Prop. 30 free-up unexpected funds to address wildfires, it will be up to Cal Fire and state officials to determine how to prioritize the spending. And, the only sure thing to know about fire in California is that it won't be nearly enough. <br/>40% <br/>give or take. That's the share of the discretionary spending in the state budget that is required by law to fund K-12 education. The actual amount varies from year to year and depends on a formula that very few Californians actually understand[36]. <br/>But the money raised by Prop. 30 would be exempt from that requirement. That's why the California Teachers Association, the state's largest union of educators, opposes the measure, which it says would 'set a dangerous precedent[37].' <br/><br/><br/><br/>CalMatters data

Glendora Ridge Road and Glendora Mountain Road were both open.</p><p>\"We ask our public to stay out of the fire area to allow the land to recover,\" the USFS said. \"Due to the good work of the firefighters, the Ranch 2 Fire did not turn into a large fire. The rugged and steep terrain, the dry chaparral and very, very warm days made this an unusually challenging fire.</p><p>The USFS is estimating that full containment will be achieved on Friday.</p><p>No structural damage has been reported since the suspected arson blaze began about 2:45 p.m. on Aug. 13 near North San Gabriel Canyon Road and North Ranch Road.</p><p>Eight cases of heat-related injuries to firefighters have been reported, and 50 firefighters have been treated for exposure to poison oak during the firefighting effort, said Capt. Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority, who served as an information officer for the Ranch2 Fire.</p><p>The number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced Monday to 275 from more than 400 during the weekend.</p><p>Felony charges were filed last week against a 36-year-old homeless man who allegedly set the blaze during an argument with a fellow transient. Osmin Palencia, who lives in a tent near the Mountain Cove community, could face up to 23 years in state prison if convicted of one count each of arson during a state of emergency and arson of a structure or forest, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.</p><p>Palencia -- who allegedly has a prior conviction from 2015 for dissuading a witness -- surrendered to authorities on Aug. 16 and has remained behind bars since then. He is set to be arraigned Sept. 11 at the West Covina courthouse.</p><p>The Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from very high to extreme last week and moved into full fire-restriction mode, including prohibiting camp fires in developed sites.

Vegetation remains at critical dryness levels, U.S. Forest Service officials said.</p><p>\"All flanks of the fire appear to remain stable, with some crews staying on the mountain overnight so they can seek out any isolated areas of heat,\" the Forest Service said in a statement Monday.</p><p>Crews have been focusing on building containment lines on the western edge of the fire between Fern and Cold Creek canyons, according to fire officials, who said good relative humidity recovery was expected to help slow fire activity.</p><p>The western flank of the fire, where terrain is especially steep, has been especially difficult for firefighters, according to the U.S. Forest Service, which is estimating that full containment will be achieved on Friday.</p><p>No structural damage has been reported since the suspected arson blaze began about 2:45 p.m. Aug. 13 near North San Gabriel Canyon Road and North Ranch Road.</p><p>Eight cases of heat-related injuries to firefighters have been reported, and 50 firefighters have been treated for exposure to poison oak during the firefighting effort, said Capt. Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority, who is serving as an information officer for the Ranch2 Fire.</p><p>The number of firefighters assigned to the blaze was reduced Monday to 275 from more than 400 during the weekend. Incident commanders anticipate reducing that number further in the near future, Concialdi said.</p><p>Felony charges were filed last week against a 36-year-old homeless man who allegedly set the blaze during an argument with a fellow transient. Osmin Palencia, who lives in a tent near the Mountain Cove community, could face up to 23 years in state prison if convicted of one count each of arson during a state of emergency and arson of a structure or forest, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.</p><p>Palencia -- who allegedly has a prior conviction from 2015 for dissuading a witness -- surrendered to authorities on Aug. 16 and has remained behind bars since then. He is set to be arraigned Sept. 11 at the West Covina courthouse.</p><p>All evacuation orders have been lifted, but the following road closures remain in effect:</p><p>-- San Gabriel Canyon Road/Highway 39: closed at Northbound Highway 39 at Sierra Madre Avenue (southbound Highway 39 is closed at East Fork Road);</p><p>-- Glendora Mountain Road: closed from Big Dalton to East Fork;</p><p>-- Glendora Ridge Road: closed from Glendora Mountain Road to Mt. Baldy Road; and</p><p>-- Santa Anita Canyon Road: closed from Arno Drive to Chantry Flats Road.</p><p>The Angeles National Forest changed its Forest Fire Danger Level from very high to extreme last week and moved into full fire-restriction mode, including prohibiting camp fires in developed sites. Cooking stoves, lanterns and similar devices that use propane, white gas or similar fuels are prohibited.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-AZUSAFIRERANCH2FIRENEARAZUSA93CONTAINED</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P1-KMH1-JCBD-1001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><timeReceived>1:41 AM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City News Service, Inc.

Sell them Vermont (cheap) if they will take Nashua. It's just a suggestion. But along the same vein (sort of), five red counties in Oregon have had enough of Gov. </p><p>Kate Brown and all that Oregon Democrat BS (Blue Sh!t).They propose joining Idah to become a State Called Greater Idaho[1]. We've heard this sort of thing from counties in California, including plans to break that thing up into several new states and leave the leftiest-left coast to fend for itself. What's different? The Washington Times reports[2],  Move Oregon's Border, also known as Greater Idaho, confirmed Tuesday that the initiative to move swaths of largely rural eastern and southern Oregon into Idaho qualified for the May 18 special election ballot in five counties: Baker, Grant, Lake, Malheur and Sherman.  They're voting on it! Why leave? Have you heard of Portland? The land of Antifa. How about their Governor Kate Brown[3] and every clone of her that follows.[4]  'Oregon is a powder keg because counties that belong in a red-state like Idaho are ruled by Portlanders,' saidMike McCarter[5], president of Move Oregon's Border, in a statement.  And there's this[6]. 1. Oregon will continue to get worse on social and cultural issues and American freedoms because Republicans are outnumbered. Addicts will be attracted to Oregon from all over the world by the 2020 drug decriminalization law. 2. Idaho enforces the law against rioters, forest fire arsonists, and other criminals. Idaho protects citizens. 3. Idaho is the state with the 8th smallest tax burden, and Oregon ranks 33rd, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://taxfoundation.org/tax-freedom-day-2019\">https://taxfoundation.org/tax-freedom-day-2019</url> . Combining all taxes together, including sales tax, the average Idahoan pays $1722 less in taxes per year than the average Oregonian. That's averaging together every adult or child, employed, retired or unemployed. And cost of living is 39% higher in Oregon than in Idaho. Oregon tax rates will continue to go up due to a lack of willingness to control spending. 4. Idaho allows forests to be managed to prevent destruction of housing from huge wildfires. 5. Idaho has less regulation than any other state, low unemployment, and would allow our rural industries to revive and employ us again, driving up wages and reducing welfare use.  Does Idaho even want them? Well, according to Greater Idaho it would be good for the state and the new counties that join it but the movement has bigger plans than just Oregon. If the organizers had their way, Greater Idaho would include about 75% of the Oregon Land Mass and a chunk of Northern California. <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Greater_Idaho_Split_Full-large.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Greater_Idaho_Split_Full-large.png</url> These counties are all Republican but (like California) are forced to live under Democrat rule because the blue ghettoes are heavily populated and getting denser (in every sense of the word).<url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Greater_Idaho_Split_2016_Full-By-Polical-Party.pngGreater_Idaho_Split_2016_Oregon\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Greater_Idaho_Split_2016_Full-By-Polical-Party.pngGreater_Idaho_Split_2016_Oregon</url> -Full By Political PartySecession is the ultimate expression of nullification, and Grater Idaho and is working on getting the plan on the ballot in every county on its map. What happens if these counties vote to leave Oregon? I have no clue, but I have popcorn, and that's good enough for now.

I'm very pleased to welcome you, and thank you very much for being here in Paris today for the shareholders' meeting. In this session, we will comment on the performance and the highlights of the 2022 financial year, a thematic presentation on fire safety, followed by a presentation on E3, the operating model of Nexans, followed by a description of the group's climate strategy also on the agenda.</p><p>On the agenda is the composition of the Board of Directors with the proposal to renew the mandate of Bpifrance Participations, the lead shareholder. Karine Lenglart, a Senior Investment Director, will be the permanent representative of Bpifrance Participations, if this resolution is approved, have solid experience in mergers and acquisitions within companies in various sectors and internationally will be of great value to Nexans.</p><p>We will also submit your approval the renewal of the mandate of Oscar Hasbun Martinez, Managing Director of Compania Sud Americana, and Chairman of the Strategic and Sustainable Development Committee. The group has benefited for several years from his managerial and financial experience in international companies. His sharp and agile analytical sense is a valuable asset for the group. You will be also asked to vote on the renewal of the mandate of Hubert Porte, Managing Director of Ecus Capital, who brings to Nexans his multiple skills in the field of services, finance, organizational transformation and M&amp;A, in addition to his in-depth knowledge of the group's businesses.</p><p>Finally, the renewal of my own mandate as an independent director is also submitted to your vote. I would be delighted to continue to put my expertise and strategy in international organizations at the service of the company. In addition, we are submitting to your vote a remuneration program entirely designed, in line with the group's strategic objectives up to 2024.</p><p>2022 is a record year with results never before achieved, proof of the relevance of Nexans' vision and ambition. In line with the dividend policy implemented in 2021 and beyond the stock market performance, we propose a distribution of a dividend of EUR 2.10 per share. We will have the opportunity to come back to this during the meeting.</p><p>At the entrance to this room, you will find an exhibition illustrating our offer in the field of fire safety. We'll come back to that. Highlights in the field of sustainable development; the Nexans Foundation, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year; and our philanthropy actions, in line with the values and commitments of your group. I would like to thank the representatives of the Cure Institute, which Nexans has supported for several years for their presence this year. I hope you enjoyed this exhibition.</p><p>I hereby declare open the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Nexans, meeting in an ordinary and extraordinary session. In order to facilitate the voting of resolutions and to allow a quick display of the results, we use the electronic voting system, which is fast and secure. You have received an electronic voting tablet at the entrance, which contains, among other things, the notice.</p><p>I invite you to use it and to return it at the end of the meeting. I remind you that the universal registration documents can be downloaded from our website. You can consult it on request from the hostesses. For environmental reasons, and as you know, we no longer printed systematically.</p><p>Finally, I would like to inform you that this meeting is public. It is filmed and recorded for live and recorded broadcast on the website -- on the Internet. Unless you object, your image may be saved and broadcast on the Nexans website. I'm joined today by Anne Lebel, Independent Lead Director; Christopher Guerin, Managing Director; Jean-Christophe Juillard, Deputy Managing Director and CFO; and Nino Cusimano, General Counsel and Sec General. I also welcome the members of the Board of Directors and to thank them for their presence.</p><p>Also in the room are the other members of the Executive Committee, some of whom will be joining us on stage later for presentations. I would like to greet the auditors, Mrs. Juliette Decoux-Guillemot, representing Mazars and Edouard Demarcq representing PwC.</p><p>In my capacity as Chairman of the Board of Directors, I will now constitute the bureau of the shareholders' meeting. In accordance with the law, the 2 members of the meeting present who have the greatest number of votes and who accept these functions are the scrutineers. According to the information on the attendance sheet, the 2 shareholders present and representing the largest votes are Investments Limited and Bpifrance Participations.</p><p>We ask these 2 shareholders at the beginning of the meeting, if they would accept to act as scrutineers, and they accepted it. I, therefore, propose to choose our scrutineers. On the one hand, Investments Limited, a member of the General Meeting, who has agreed to fulfill this function represented by (inaudible); and on the other hand, Bpifrance Participations, member of the general meeting, agreed to fulfill this function represented by Luis Pereira. I also propose that Mr. Nino Cusimano, Secretary General and General Counsel, will be chosen as secretary. The bureau is, therefore, validly constituted.</p><p>So the quorum. I'll remind you that this assembly is meeting on first notice. And the legally required quorum has been reached, 81.9%, representing 1,731 shareholders. So the quorum has been reached. The quorum is 20% of the shares entitled to vote for decisions of the ordinary general meeting, Resolutions 1 to 17 and Resolution 29 for today, and a quorum of 25% of the shares entitled to vote for decisions of the Extraordinary General Meeting, i.e., Resolutions 18 to 28. Consequently, the bureau notes that the combined general meeting, having more than the required quorum, can validly elaborate on the items on the agenda, which are the responsibility of the OGM and the EGM.</p><p>So this session will be conducted as follows. First, we will proceed to the completion of the legal formalities. After a short introduction video, Christopher Guerin will review the highlights and the main achievement of the year 2022. Jean-Christophe Juillard, who will continue the presentation with a comment on the 2022 financial results and the turnover for the first quarter of '23. This will be followed by thematic presentations on fire safety by Jerome Fournier, the Corporate Vice President, Innovation, Service and Growth.</p><p>Then the E32 unique operational model specific to Nexans, Christopher Guerin and Maria Lorente Corporate Vice President will comment on that, and she is also in charge of CSR. And then the climate strategy and initiatives taken by Nexans is an additional item on our agenda without a vote of the shareholders. It will be presented by Marc Grynberg, the Climate Director. Finally, we will offer you an update on governance, candidates for the Board of Directors and remuneration with Anne Lebel, Independent Lead the Director, Chair of the Nation and Corporate Governance Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Afterwards, we will hear the reports of the statutory auditors.</p><p>We will then take questions from the floor and from the shareholders who are watching this session live on the Internet, thanks to the chat system set up on the broadcast side. Finally, you will vote on the proposed resolutions.</p><p>It is noted that the company has not received any request for the inclusion of additional resolutions or items on the agenda. We have not received any written questions from shareholders either.</p><p>I'll give the floor to the Secretary of the General Meeting for formalities.</p><p>ANTONINO CUSIMANO, SENIOR CORPORATE VP, GENERAL COUNSEL &amp; SECRETARY GENERAL, NEXANS S.A.: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I confirm that all documents required for this general meeting have been made available to the shareholders in accordance with the law. In particular, you will find the various reports of the Board of Directors in the Universal Registration Document 2022 and on the company's website.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: I now hand over to the Managing Director, Christopher Guerin.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN, CEO, NEXANS S.A.: Thank you, Jean. Ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders, good afternoon. We welcome you with pleasure this year for the General Meeting 2023, here remotely and physically. We have a lot of people connected remotely. We are very proud of our initiatives here. We want to work for the common good, especially to give access to electricity to the population deprived of that. And that's what we are doing through the Nexans Foundation. We've been doing that for over 10 years. So we'll show you a video clip summarizing the actions of the last decade.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: We can give them a round of applause. A small contribution, but allowing us to provide electricity to over 2.2 million inhabitants in the world. We are going to increase the budget, up to 400 million each year. And we renewed our commitment to the NGOs mentioned in the video. They were all gathered at France physically and remotely to show our commitment to them for the next few years. So this is it for the foundation. I'm going to come back to the highlights of 2022.</p><p>I do not know whether you remember, but in 2021, we said that we were starting a hyper cycle of the electrification of the world. Why hypercycle? Between '50, 1970, a huge turnaround took place. We needed to replace the full site energies, and we needed to resort to renewable energies. A lot of investments in a lot of countries are taking place. And a huge need to renew the grids, the electrical grids contrary to the telco network has not been renewed. There are over 50 years old in Europe, over 40 in America. A huge need to renew the grids. And electrification of usage on a daily basis will speed up the decarbonation of the world.</p><p>So you see that through electric cars, electric heating. It's a step forward towards the decarbonation of the world. So yes, we -- only in the first years of the electrification. In 2021, we were among the rare companies to talk about it. And in the last 2 years, many events and many announcements confirm that we are heading towards this line.</p><p>So this confirms our strategy. Our strategy is to have a pure -- to be a pure player of electrification, and this is true for 20 years. We'll need 20 years to renew -- to work at the renewal of the grids, and 20 years to move from the fossil energy to renewable energy, and 20 years before 100% of the car fleet is electrical, and that we keep on developing trains.</p><p>The 2022 we'll see the full release of the potential of the new Nexans. That's what we said in 2022. We have not lied to you. So the highlights in 2022, that's what you see on this slide. I've been here for 25 years at Nexans. I started at Alcatel and we never reached this performance in terms of financial results. So congratulations to the teams. Of course, this is -- we have the right strategy, the right momentum, but we need to get results. And we have a record EBITDA and free cash flow and return on capital employed.</p><p>And we are also looking for growth, mainly in terms of value and not so much in terms of volume. Why? Because we have our commitments in terms of environment. And Marc Grynberg will unveil them. So it's important not to look for volume for the sake of volume and consume a lot of raw materials. That's the challenge of our transformation platform. We want to have the right economic performance and right environmental performance, liquidities reinforced. Jean-Christophe will come back to it with a robust balance sheet. Therefore, we can increase the dividend up to EUR 2.10 per share.</p><p>Given our strategic road map, we have just completed the acquisition of a firm in Finland, and we are disposing the telco activities. The telco activities are nice activities like the industrial activities, but since we want to refocus on the electrification of the world, we need to reallocate all our R&amp;D and financial resources and managerial resources on the purely electrification activities.</p><p>Order book, which is a record one. I do not know whether you saw the last information -- the latest information. In December, we announced the signing of the signing contract linking France to Ireland with a subsea cable of over 700 kilometers. And I was in Berlin 2 days ago to sign EUR 1.7 billion contract for wind farms in Germany and in the Netherlands, the largest contract in our history. So Marc will talk about the acceleration of the decarbonation, and we had minus 78%, a very nice photovoltaic facility in Morocco.</p><p>Each year, we organize our climate today with experts and analysts for the sustainable world. In New York last year, almost 900 people were present and connected, so huge success for Nexans for this climate today in New York. And we are doing it this year with the Moroccan government and all our employees from Morocco. It will be in September. So I'm not going to come back to the foundation. It was already mentioned in the video clip.</p><p>We are still climbing the mountain in terms of financial performance. EBITDA was at EUR 325 million in 2018 with 2 profit warnings. I know you were unhappy about that in 2018. There was a new team in July 2018, so up in 2019. Of course, COVID came around in 2020. And in spite of everything, we're still improving EUR 600 million. And you can see the number for EBITDA versus sales.</p><p>There's a curve that you've never seen over the past 10 years in Nexans. Generation of free cash. We generated EUR 1.2 billion, nearly EUR 1.2 billion in free cash flow while still investing new ship -- with the new ship Aurora to lay cables at sea, and our plant, which is running at full capacity for offshore wind farms in the U.S. EUR 1.2 billion in cumulative free cash flow.</p><p>And our transformation is structural, and it is not based only on a specific situation. You see that ROCE for electrification, which has always been around 9% for a number of years as well, we jumped from 9% to 29%. And their strategic investments -- we exclude the strategic investment as well, above 32%. And the group jumped from 9% to 20%. So in terms of financial performance, we need to pay tribute to the teams because, thanks to them, we've been able to reach very high levels for these 3 criteria.</p><p>As I suggested, well, just a few weeks ago, we signed the acquisition of a beautiful company near Helsinki. 270 people, 3 plants, EUR 172 million in sales in 2022. It's not a mega acquisition, but what -- we are looking at areas that we considered premium areas. And where we know that there will be plenty of investments when it comes to sustainable electrification, a great acquisition with Reka here. And we are still disposing of telecom, a fine business, indeed. But telecom is a new partner to grow. Investments must be doubled for 5G, and we prefer to focus our capital on electrification. So the disposal is in progress.</p><p>Before I hand over to Jean-Christophe, this is a photograph that was taken 3 months ago. A month ago, it was different from this. This is the extension of our plant in Norway, a new production tower. It's vertical production for submarine cables. The delivery of this plant section in Norway should take place by the end of the year, December or early 2024, in line with the schedule.</p><p>And we will begin the production of 2 key projects, Salt, which I mentioned, and Borwin 6, one of the longest offshore wind connections by Tenet. And the new contract will begin in 2026. So it's a part of that.</p><p>Okay. I'll come back later to speak about Nexans' performance model. But I'd like to hand over to Jean-Christophe Juilliard, deputy CEO and CFO.</p><p>JEAN-CHRISTOPHE JUILLARD, SENIOR CORPORATE VP, DEPUTY CEO &amp; CFO, NEXANS S.A.: Good afternoon, dear shareholders. I'm going to tell you about the 2022 financial results, which Chris broached upon. The financial performance of broke a record ever since the IPO in 2001, across the board of indicators for which we give guidance to the financial community.</p><p>Let me begin with the statement of income. You can see sales with a strong growth, 6.3% organic growth in 2022. All the businesses grew organically, high voltage. Low voltage cables for buildings, which also grew very handsomely in 2022. EBITDA reached EUR 599 million, 30% growth from 2021. I'll come back to this in greater detail in a moment. Margin jumped 1.3 points, driven by all the businesses. And operating margin was 6.2%, another record for the group.</p><p>Reorganization costs are still dropping. In 2019, we wrote off a reorganization expense of over EUR 200 million, as you may recall. And this enabled us to speed up the transformation of the group in the first few years of the transformation plan. Now for some years, this expense is normalizing. It has been normalizing. And year after year, it has been dropping. And last year, it amounted to EUR 39 million versus EUR 58 million in the previous year.</p><p>Other operating items. Down, as you can see, due to one-off specific items. The main item is the change in the price of raw materials, notably copper. As you may know, we have -- we are impacted by swings in metal prices, EUR 100 million or so, an increase in the average price of copper. I mean, in 2022, the price of copper dropped and the expense was EUR 30 million. That explains the bulk of the variation.</p><p>Operating income amounted to nearly EUR 400, EUR 395 million to be precise. Net financial expense interest also significantly down. That item included impairment of cash in Lebanon. And that had an impact in 2021 that cannot be found in 2022. In 2022, it's more normal, so to speak. Income before tax, EUR 339 million, income tax. This, of course, increases with the result. And with a record net income of EUR 248 million versus EUR 164 million in the previous fiscal period.</p><p>Now let's take a quick look at EBITDA, plus 30%. As I said -- plus 39%, excuse me, and you see the various businesses. all across the board. There has been an uplift in EBITDA. So all the businesses contributed to that. A word about usage. In 2022, there was a twofold good impact, strong volume demand. And the price environment was also auspicious, notably in North America. Well this, of course, drove further the financial performance. Margin rate, EBITDA over sales, near 9% at the end of 2022.</p><p>Looking at electrification. As you know, electrification is at the core of our strategy to be a pure electrification player. In 2021, we committed 2 major performance levers in terms of profitability growth in electrification. Every year -- every half year, rather, we report on the progress made in electrification. So EBITDA jumped 39% in electrification, EUR 327 million to EUR 454 million, 2 major levers in our strategy there.</p><p>Amplify, that is our ability to generate more sales with the existing products through diversification and value creation or by increasing capacity. Typically, our new plant in Charleston, South Carolina ascribes for -- subscribe for EUR 20 million in this contribution. Then there's SHIFT. SHIFT is the increased value through transformation services, packaging. There, we jacked up prices consistently throughout 2022, and we generated EUR 28 million in additional EBITDA. Then there's the acquisition of Centelsa, that's a change in scope.</p><p>And from H2 2022, it contributed to financial performance and the very favorable impact, which is due to the situation because above and beyond the profitability norm, high levels and the strong prices. Notably in North America, we've been able to generate EUR 61 million. That's what we call conjunctural and one-off 12% margin in electrification.</p><p>Now moving on to another very important indicator where things were good in 2022, The cash generation, the -- from 0.2 in 2021 to 0.4. So it's stable. We look, of course, at the acquisition of Centelsa in America. You can see this EUR 255 million under M&amp;A here.</p><p>Of course, part of our strategic plan -- but you do see that operating cash flow was very high, EUR 450 million. We further improved working capital requirement. At the end of 2022, it reached a record in terms of the ratio, an industry record. 2.9% of sales. As you may recall, a few years ago, we were above 10%, where capital requirement over sales. So a lot of efforts were conducted with the SHIFT program to rationalize our stocks, notably, and to be more selective in our clients and products.</p><p>Investment expenses, very high there, but that does include the extension of our plant in Norway to meet ever-rising demand for submarine cables. We invested nearly EUR 280 million to double the capacity of the plant. This is in 2022 and 2023. It straddles both fiscal years, and it accounts for the high level of investment expenses. A normalized free cash flow generation, but there are EUR 393 million normalized free cash flow.</p><p>Now at a glance, let's take a look at the balance sheet. Very robust, as you can see here. While I spoke about working capital, it's improving. Noncurrent assets, there's CapEx, Centelsa acquisition. I spoke about on the various items here. I think it speaks for itself. Provisions are slightly down because we're still burning provisions from the previous years, and there are no new significant provisions on the balance sheet.</p><p>Total financing, EUR 2.4 billion. It's very robust. Indeed, if you take a look at the top 2 ratios in our covenants, a slight increase in your ratios, but this is due to the Centelsa acquisition. But it remains well below the covenant requirements, in our bond and revolving debt instruments.</p><p>Looking at liquidity now. As at December 31, 2022, record cash flow, a little over EUR 1.1 billion in cash flow. I spoke about the net debt, slightly up due to the Centelsa acquisition. Total liquidity, EUR 1.9 billion add this to the EUR 1.1 billion in the cash we have on the balance sheet or EUR 800 million in the revolving credit facility, where we have not used up everything, and we've refinanced we refinanced at the end of fiscal '22. You see the maturity of our gross debt, EUR 1.3 billion mentioned here on the right. The debt -- bond debt due in '23 was refinanced with another bond issue last month, maturity 5 years. And the '23 bond issue was reimbursed.</p><p>Okay. So much for the accounts with a bunch of indicators. I did not tell you that Standard &amp; Poor's -- well, kept their rating, BB+. But the outlook is better. Now it's positive, used to be neutral. So BB+ in 2021 with a positive outlook now in 2022, which augurs well -- which bodes well to move ahead in the coming months.</p><p>Now a quick word about our parent company account. Not much worth writing -- saying there, the statement of income and the balance sheet of Nexans. There is an increase in dividend with the subsidiaries. And net profit, EUR 73 million, up from 2021. Increase in financial debt. As you can see here, this is because we drew some money from the European investment bank loan. We had a specific European loan to mainly finance renewable CapEx. And we drew some money there to finance the plant extension in Norway.</p><p>Okay, now I'm going to comment on sales and the Q1 '23 trend that we presented with regard to the financial community a few weeks ago. We reported organic growth of 2.2% in Q1 '23 from Q1 '22. If you exclude other activities, that's mainly metallurgical works. The strategic objective and excellence is to reduce that business because margin is low. We want to keep it in the portfolio of our businesses, but we want to serve only the needs we have at Nexans. So if you exclude that, the organic growth is 6.5%. EUR 1.7 billion, constant copper price.</p><p>If you take a look at the chart here, you can see that in this organic growth, there is sharp growth in non-electrification businesses, 2 of major items here in Q1. The exceptional performance of our automotive harness business. In spite of the war on Ukraine, sales have been rising. And mining in the U.S. with American. And that accounts for a big chunk of the organic growth recorded in Q1, excluding electrification. And when it comes to electrification, however, the stagnation of organic growth is due to our will to move away from oil and gas, which is nonstrategic for the group. And in Q1 '23, that explains this drop in organic growth in high voltage.</p><p>Okay. I'll close with the 2023 guidance, which we shared with the financial community when we presented the 2022 results in February. EBITDA between EUR 570 million and EUR 630 million for fiscal '23. So it's a bit broader bracket there due to the environmental, the economic uncertainty out there. Today, we're starting to have somewhat better visibility. We will probably restate our guidance and our half year results presentation.</p><p>And the second indicator that we're guiding the financial community to is normalized free cash flow, between EUR 150 million and EUR 250 million. We may see another broad bracket here, but it's also highly dependent on the deposits we got for our high-voltage contracts. Chris spoke about major deposit that we got at the end of 2022, an interim payment, and we're also expecting interim payments in 2023, notably for Tenet, the contract we've just finalized, okay?</p><p>So, so much for the results and the overview for 2023.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Thank you, Jean-Christophe. Before I hand over to Jerome Fournier, who is in charge of innovation. I'd like say the world has been electrifying. So the risk of fire has been growing in the world. There is a fire that starts up every other minute in buildings. 80% of these fires are due to faulty electrical architecture. 50% of buildings in Europe and in the U.S. were built before the '70s, and electric consumption is constantly rising, so risks are rising.</p><p>But there are solutions, as you will see in this video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>J\u00c3\u00a9R\u00c3\u00b4ME FOURNIER, NEXANS S.A.: (foreign language) Ladies and gentlemen, shareholders, as you've seen here in this video clip, the protection against electrical fires is a necessity to save lives, to save habitats, to reduce economic losses. I would like to come back to some key figures. In Europe, over 1 million fires each year, with consequences like 4,000 deaths and economic losses of common goods, about EUR 25 billion each year.</p><p>Worldwide, it's over 4 million fires each year, 20,000 fatalities, a real disaster. And the World Bank reported EUR 330 billion of economic cost in the world each year since we are having this energy transition. And since we are starting a wave of electrication, 4.0 over the 20 years for decarbonated electricity, the analysis of these statistics is not acceptable because we have solutions. Solutions do exist.</p><p>And I would like to comment on the development of fire within a few minutes, 4 steps. First, you have the ignition, the spark, the cigarettes or forest fire, the short circuit, the hot point for an electrical system. The second step is the smoke coming very quickly, especially when it's a PVC cable or halogen. Third step is the spread of flames along the systems or in the buildings. And the fourth step is called flash over, a total ignition, smokes of organic matters at high temperature start burning. And we reach a temperature of over 1,000 degrees -- 1,100 degrees.</p><p>There are technological solutions for each step, preventing from ignition with small flame solutions, enabling to reduce the quantity of a smoke drastically. And this is a real difference with the current PVC cables. Smoke arrives in the buildings within a few minutes and is often the origin of the problem. The solutions we offer allow us to postpone the appearance of smoke after 20 minutes, so that the people, the fire brigade, can come and we can rescue, we can save lives.</p><p>We have solutions to slow down the spread in the ascending columns. And during the flash over, there are solutions, so as to feeding the safety systems in the buildings like the risk emergency exists, doors which have to close and so on. Cables can supply those systems from -- with electricity for several hours at a temperature of over 1,000 degrees.</p><p>Those solutions exist within Nexans. We've been working on innovations and on those solutions for over 20 years. At the research center, AmpaCity, we have over 100 researchers, over 1,000 simulation tests in different conditions. We have a portfolio of over 150 patents. We are working in cooperation with the very important international bodies, and we have accreditations on -- and certifications on the protections against fire.</p><p>As you understand, what we want to do is keep on innovating, of course. But we also want, first and foremost, to deploy those innovations. We want to roll them out and use them. We believe that the plan will be aligned in the next few years, and it is absolutely essential. Given the energy transition and the wave of electrification, it is absolutely essential to limit and take into account the risk of electrical fires.</p><p>First, building market. This market could reach EUR 81 billion by 2030 versus EUR 55 billion in 2019. And you have the acceleration of the decarbonated electrification plus 20% of electricity consumption by 2030, confirmed by all analysis and electrification players. The acceleration of the new buildings and the revamping, refurbishing, we see new standards, new regulations in terms of safety coming. And of course, a lot of innovations in the high, medium and low voltage, the reliability of the electrical grids. And this reliability exists as well for usage, to respond to these electrical mobility with the recharging systems in the houses or in the cellars.</p><p>The renewable distributed electricity, photovoltaic panels on roofs, the new air conditioning systems, which should be electrical. So we have a usage of electrification behind all these figures. And the technological solutions to protect from fires, those could reach EUR 9 billion by 2030. That is to say, 10% of the whole electrical system market.</p><p>Nexans would like to play a very strong leadership in the deployment of those solutions to protect from the electrical fires. We wish to be the leaders in the replacement of PVC. And we did that already in some parts of the world, to move from PVC to higher technology called cables to protect against the fires. And in using this know-how of Nexans, the margins of those systems will be higher than the commodity systems. It's a matter of protecting buildings, and it's not a matter of selling just commodity cable per meter.</p><p>The protection systems of buildings incorporate more digitalization of the service of people and goods with sensors, with the digitization of electrical systems, enabling higher protection level. And then we will give the priority to countries with higher safety standards. But we should not wait for standards. We have to anticipate on the regulation in order to better protect buildings. We'll start, of course, with the data centers, hospitals, acquiring higher safety level renovation in the city centers. And we will deploy the solutions of cabling systems with protection against electric fires.</p><p>I would be delighted to answer all your questions after this presentation. And now I'm going to give the floor to Christopher. He's going to talk about the new operating model of Nexans.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Thank you, Jerome. To conclude on the cable resistance to fire. Next week, we are going to deliver, and we were on the work site 2 months ago. We are going to deliver 200 kilometers for Notre Dame de Paris. Of course, we deliver that freely resisting fires. Because if those cable would have been present at the cathedral, especially in the roof, the fire would have not been as dramatic as it has been.</p><p>Good afternoon, Maria Lorente. You and I are going to organize a session on the operating model, performance model of Nexans. We launched it 2 years ago, and I'm going to give the floor to Maria. It becomes more and more complex to manage a company for several reasons. First, as you saw, the world is entering into constant crisis cycle. Beforehand, there were some rest between crisis.</p><p>Now there is piling up of crisis: The climate crisis, and the intensity of which it keeps on increasing; the geopolitic crisis; health crisis; cyber crisis; economic, social crisis. So we have a plethora of crisis. It is very difficult to make shorter-term projections, that's why we work in the long term. And we also have to manage the paradoxical injunctions, volume versus value, profit versus environment, growth versus sobriety, productivity versus social impact and infinite resources versus resource constraints. We consume 1.7x each year what the planet can offer us.</p><p>In Europe, we tend to be with indicators. We put indicators on everything. We believe that, that's solution to the major problems. This is not the case. So we have a plethora of indicators, sometimes without any logical approach. So we wanted, therefore, 3 years ago, during the COVID crisis, the world was having a rest. So we were wondering how managing differently and shedding a new light to our managers to help them on a daily basis to manage those injunctions and this constant crisis situation and the current world.</p><p>So we examined and reviewed a lot of our training courses existing worldwide, in Harvard, Insead, HTC, everywhere. And we did not see a holistic approach with the 3 pillars. We saw very nice training programs on environment, on the social impact, but it was always in silo. We read a lot of books as well, but it was always according to a silo approach. So we decided to develop our own performance model. It's been a ramping up process. Each business has a profitability objective. You saw the results profits. So today, our investments for tomorrow, it is out of question to put profits aside.</p><p>But how can -- do we generate this profit, and which impact it has on the environmental portion and which impact has on the expertise? So we created our own model. I told you last year, it is seldom to hear companies announcing, giving up 13,000 customers out of 17,000. That's what we did. The sales of Nexans in the past came from the 17,000 customers. Now we only have 4,000 customers we serve each year.</p><p>So we got rid of 13,000 customers for proprietary reasons. And more and more, we force our factories to work in a very local scope deliver their products within less than 800 kilometers for economic reasons, but also for foot -- carbon footprint reasons. As you see -- in the introduction, we work on the Roche and we also work on the return on the carbon employed. And not only the capital employed, we serve -- we want to make sure that we have this indicator, the return on the carbon employed. And through the presentation of Marc Grynberg, you will see the parallel we make between the economics and environment. But Maria Lorente will talk about the engagement.</p><p>MARIA LORENTE FRAGUAS, SENIOR CORPORATE VP &amp; CHIEF HR OFFICER, NEXANS S.A.: Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon to you all. I'm going to talk about the engagement. I've been thinking quite a lot over what is the engagement for Nexans. And I said to myself rather than trying to explain it, I was going to illustrate that with a few pictures.</p><p>Engagement starts with the individual. We have to recognize and value our employees. As you see here in this example, in our Belgium site, our employee, Jacques, is being applauded by the whole site for an exceptional contribution. He was just awarded the Remarkable People prize. Engagement, it means also to welcome and onboard the new employees within the Nexans family as we did that for Centelsa, the celebration integration, and we stated that with our Reka teams in Finland.</p><p>Engagement also imply -- involves our customers, our partners, our suppliers. On this picture, you see our customers, Huawei, who visited us in May in France. And you see our employees in the field to make sure that we're close to the customer needs. This example that's very important to me because it reflects our contribution to have access -- to giving access to a sustainable energy.</p><p>It's a team of volunteers from Nexans working with the NGO Fondem in Brazil within the framework of the foundation. And I wanted to show you an example of our family day. During those days, we invite all our employees, but also their families, their relatives. During those days, everything revolves around safety. We reassert our beliefs, safety and the well-being of our employees, our priorities. And that's an obligation, a duty to us all.</p><p>In this example, you see this is the inauguration of our photovoltaic power facility in Mohamedia in Morocco. Because engagement also means to contribute to the carbon neutrality in showing an example in setting. So we did that in Morocco. We did it as well in Turkey and in Lebanon.</p><p>And I wanted to finish with this picture. It was a short, a few days ago in Lebanon. As you know, Lebanon to us is a relay of engagement. They understood that engagement could create very strong links among teams to overcome all possible challenges. And that's what they do every day. This photograph was taken after team building exercise. The 350 employees of the factory worked all together to build a bridge of 20 meters within less than 2 hours. All those examples reminds us of something: Engagement more than ever is key for the success of the company.</p><p>Our engagement rate keeps increasing each year. In 2022, it was 77%, which is very good. But I'm convinced that we can do even better. And we can do better -- we are going to do better in resorting to the 5 pillars you see on the screen, the basic needs of the employees. This way, the employees will feel well at work. And when we share a clear vision, a source of inspiration for the future and when we work for the well-being and the professional development of our employees. When we create a trustworthy environment, then the employee will give the best of himself or herself. They will be more engaged, more creative and more innovative.</p><p>And our model, E3, is already showing results. 85% of the sites with a higher level of engagement, have the best economic performance as well. Our objective is to develop this model where economy, environment and engagement converge for the common good. All this around culture, whereby employees embark upon the adventure with us, not only because that's their job, but because it is meaningful for them. This is the culture, source of inspiration and source of success for Nexans.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Thank you. Thank you, Maria Lorente. Thank you to you all for this interesting presentation.</p><p>I would like to invite Marc Grynberg, the Director in Charge of Climate, to come to the rostrum, to the stage, and to talk about the climate strategy of Nexans and the actions taken in this field.</p><p>MARC GRYNBERG, INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, NEXANS S.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, shareholders, it's a pleasure for me to make a presentation on our ambitions and road map in terms of climate. The role of the Climate Director was created about a year ago and mainly consists of helping the management prepare the works of the Board and the committees of the Board in the field of climate.</p><p>In the last year, we focused, as a Climate Director, on the road map to reduce the greenhouse gas. And we also examined the effect of the current standards, like the European taxonomy or the future standards like the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting directive for 2024. In 2023, at the beginning of the year, we finalized and fine-tuned our ambitions and our road map in the field of climate. And I will give you the explanations in a few minutes.</p><p>And later, we'll -- during the year, we'll focus on biodiversity, the practical impact of the implementation of this new European reporting directive. And later during the year, we will concentrate on our strategy in terms of recycling. This strategy aims at increasing the recycled content of our products to reduce the carbon content and securing the raw material procurement.</p><p>Before looking at our ambitions and the road map, I wanted to recall that at Nexans, when we talk of an ambition, strategy or a climate challenge and stakes, it's not just a matter of talking about the way we reduce the environmental impact of our industrial activities, but we wanted to see how we can contribute to the energy transition, a crucial challenge mentioned by Chris some minutes ago.</p><p>It is important to outline that Nexans plays a major role in this energy transition. It's a key player since we provide innovative technological solutions to link the wind farms offshore, to connect them to electrical grid, to connect the grids of different regions together, or to distribute these renewable electricity to the consumers.</p><p>So social impact, which will keep on -- increase and which is very significant. And we want to reduce, of course, the greenhouse gas effect. This contribution is quite significant. The emissions generated by our activities amount to 240,000 tonnes of CO2. It is just a small fraction of what we could do in terms of energy transition as well.</p><p>Let's talk about those ambitions to reduce our emissions. In order to do so, let's say that if we talk of green gas, greenhouse gas, there are 3 categories of emissions. There's Scope 1 emissions, that's the greenhouse gas generated by our industrial operations by the equipment we use in our factories. The Scope 2 emissions regarding the carbon content of the electricity we buy.</p><p>And then the emissions of Scope 3 are emissions or carbon content associated to our activities, the upstream of our activities when the carbon content in the raw materials we buy or emissions generated by the freight of those raw materials to our production units. And then the Scope 3 emissions, downstream of activities, regard the emissions linked to the use of our products like the freight and so on.</p><p>So on the right-hand side, you see our targets, Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3, two different colors. The blue -- Scope 1 and 2, that's the blue line. And Scope 3, that's the black line. The reduction of the Scope 1 and 2 emissions depends on our actions and investments. For instance, we make in our factories to improve the energy efficiency of our equipment or the purchase of decarbonated electricity, representing 40% of the electricity we buy already.</p><p>On the other hand, the Scope 3 emissions, as far as the reduction of those emissions, will depend on the decarbonation trajectories of the various countries where our products are sold. So we depend on the choices made by others.</p><p>Let me move on to Scope 1 and 2 emissions generated in our plants or in tank with the electricity we buy. While we are committed to reducing this to 46% from the benchmark here, which is 2019. On the left here, you can see a graph that extrapolates the trajectory from 2019 to 2030, whereas the dotted blue line shows our best estimate of the trajectory as we stand today.</p><p>At the end of 2022, very good news. We had already reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 28%. And we did this, essentially, by reducing the complexity of our activities, the reduction of the number of clients, the reduction of the area of action of our plants. The improved efficiency and -- energy efficiency of our equipment, and the procurement of low-carbon, no-carbon electricity for 40% of our requirements.</p><p>We estimate that by 2026 we will go from minus 28% to minus 37%, owing to other energy efficiency improvement measures in our facilities and owing to the more widespread purchases of renewable electricity or by setting up facilities. That's what we've done in Mohamedia. And we should achieve minus 46% by 2030.</p><p>So visually, it appears that when we spoke about intensification a moment ago, virtually, if you take a look at the done blue line, well, you may not think that there's considerable intensification between 2022 and 2030 from minus 28% and 22% to achieve minus 46%. But intensification comes from the fact that on the line from 2022 to 2030, we've integrated the effect of growth. So in addition to what I mentioned, we'll have to remove the emissions generated by the growth we are expecting, which should be sharp in the coming years. If you take the growth into consideration, well, it is and the compensation of that growth, it's fair to speak about intensification of our efforts by 2030.</p><p>Okay. Let's move on to Scope 3 emissions, which have to do with our upstream and downstream operations. I think I have to point out here that virtually all of these emissions, 94% to be precise, are the result of the use of our cables. And they are dependent upon the nature of the electricity content of the cables where we sell them, a small part of the emissions have to do with the carbon content of raw materials. And in that regard, we try to increase, or to buy more low-carbon materials. Or we try to increase recycling, or we try to reduce the carbon footprint of our raw materials.</p><p>But again, in Scope 3, the factor that makes all the difference is the decarbonation trajectory of the different countries where we sell and install our products. And since we do depend on this exhaustions factor, decarbonation trajectory in various countries, that is why I would rather give you a bracket for the reduction objectives by 2030, rather than set a hard and fast number for you because of the uncertainty there is.</p><p>And as far as the velocity of the execution of the decarbonation plans in countries are. And we estimate that we should achieve 30% to 43% Scope 3 emission reductions. That's our product and activities. But between 30% and 43%. It all depends on the speed at which the countries where we sell our products manage to decarbonize their electricity.</p><p>There are plenty of projects. This is a very bustling area, decarbonization. There's recently announcements were made regarding the North Sea projects in Europe to significantly step up the production of renewable electricity for a number of European countries. The uncertainty lies in the speed of execution of these projects. And that will determine where we end up in 2030 between minus 30% and minus 43%.</p><p>There, let me hand over back to the Chairman. Thank you.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Thank you. Thank you, Marc. Now I give the floor to Anne Lebel, who is our Independent Lead Director and who heads up the nominations, governance and compensation committees, and she is going to tell us about the corporate governance and she's going to speak about the applicants who sit on the Board and the resolutions drawn up by the committees.</p><p>Anne, over to you.</p><p>ANNE LEBEL, LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, NEXANS S.A.: Ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders, as Jean has just said, I'm going to tell you about the resolutions that have to do with corporate governance, each of the resolutions that you will have to vote upon today, and which reflect the work done by the Board's committees.</p><p>To start off, first, a word about our corporate governance. As you can see on the slide here, the governance of your company fully complies with the AFEP-MEDEF code, independence rate, 54.5%, one Independent Chairman, and we have a lead independent director. There's a separation of duties between the Chairman and CEO. This has been the case since 2014 and all strategic decisions, projects and investments of over EUR 50 million subject to the Board's approval.</p><p>Also, stakeholder representation is balanced. There are 4 directors representing the main shareholders, 1 representing the employees and 2 directors who represent the employees. The regulations were set up in February '23 in compliance with AFEP-MEDEF code in order to formalize the integration of the climate strategy among the missions of the Board.</p><p>A word about what I do as Lead Independent Director. I am the go-to person for independent directors. In that regard, I conduct meetings of independent directors. There was one in 2022. I also hold executive sessions with the Board. We held two in '22. I can review the agendas of the Board meetings with the Chairman, and I can suggest additions. And I could also ask the Chairman to invite the members to attend an exceptional Board meeting, and I can also invite the directors, or head meetings in his absence.</p><p>Let's take a look at the makeup of the Board. It is balanced, diversified on the Board. We seek to enhance diversity and to have complementary skills. When I speak about diversity, it's gender, nationality, age, background experience, you name it. The role of the Climate Director was introduced at the beginning of 2022. The missions and activities were described to you a moment ago by Marc Grynberg.</p><p>In 2022, the main changes in the makeup of the Board were the following. One, Kathleen Wantz-O'Rourke resigned replaced by Laura Bernardelli last year and who now chairs the Audit Accounts and Risk Committee. Finally, as Jean suggested earlier, there was a change in the permanent representative of Bpifrance Participations, Karine Lenglart, who I'm going to introduce in a moment, was appointed in December 2022. And the committees looked at her application and made a recommendation to appoint or to the Board, but this has to be approved by the shareholders at the AGM today.</p><p>There are 4 very active committees. In last February, there were a few changes in the makeup of these committees. On the one hand, Hubert Porte and Bpifrance left the Audit Committee. Marc Grynberg joined the Audit Account and Risk Committee, and Hubert Porte joined the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee.</p><p>The purpose of these changes was to increase the rate of independence of the Audit Accounts and Risk Committee, so that it'd be fully compliant with the AFEP-MEDEF code, and it is now represented by 75% of independent directors/and also to strengthen the expertise of the committee members when it comes to the climate and the environment, in particular, to prepare for the enforcement of the Corporate Sustainable Development directive.</p><p>As I mentioned, in order to comply with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations as far as independents go and to enhance the experience of the Climate and Environment Committee.</p><p>Now let me move on to the directorships that we are submitting to your approval. There are 4 renewals. We suggest the renewal of the directorship of Jean Mouton. If he is elected, Jean will be renewed as Chairman of the Board. We are also submitting to your vote the renewal of the directorship of Bpifrance Participations for a duration of 4 years. Bpifrance Participations, as I said earlier, introduce herself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (presentation)</p><p>ANNE LEBEL: (foreign language) Thank you, Karine, for this introduction. Now the renewal of the directorship of Oscar Hasbun, submitted by Nexans Limited for another term of 4 years. Finally, we are submitting to your vote the renewal of the directorship of Hubert Porte for a duration of 4 years.</p><p>Up until now, Hubert was an independent director. And from the November 11, 2023, Hubert Porte will have been a director for over 12 years. In compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF code, the Board, therefore, proposes the renewal of his directorship as a non-independent director this time.</p><p>Now let me move on to the resolutions pertaining to compensation. Let me begin with the compensation for 2022, and I will begin with the resolutions pertaining to the compensation of the board members and of the Chairman of the Board. 2022 compensation of the Chairman of the Board, this is under Resolution 9. And then we will address the 2022 compensation of the CEO, which we will find under Resolution #10.</p><p>So for the '22 compensation paid to the directors, it was EUR 651,000. You voted to approve EUR 700,000, and there were 24 committee meetings. There were 20 meetings in 2022, and that explains the difference. Regarding the compensation of the Chairman of the Board, it was revised in 2022 after a long period where there was no change. It was EUR 250,000 since 2016. Following an external survey, it was set at EUR 320,000 in 2022 with your approval. The amount accounts for the total compensation of Jean Mouton as Independent Chairman. And he does not get any other fixed or variable compensation and no other benefit, whatever that may be.</p><p>Now let me move on to the 2022 compensation of our CEO, Christopher Guerin. This will be under Resolution 10. Regarding the fixed compensation, I would like to remind you that the compensation policy for the CEO is set for a term of 3 years. And in that regard, fixed compensation in 2022 remained unchanged. It was modified in 2021. Regarding variable compensation, the compensation policy for the CEO includes a variable portion, which accounts for a maximum of 150% of the basic salary.</p><p>It involves quantitative and qualitative objective, 60% of collective and quantitative objectives, 40% of individual objectives. For 2022, the variable compensation of our CEO amounted to EUR 1,080,900, 96.1% of his maximum, which reflects the performance of the company.</p><p>The collective portion and quantitative portion is based on 3 criteria: EBITDA, ROCE and the normalized management of cash. This collective portion was not achieved to the maximum. The individual portion was based on 4 main objectives: representing 25% of the individual portion had to do with the deployment of the strategy, operating efficiency, culture and engagement, and the deployment of the ESG strategy. This individual portion was 90.2% achieved.</p><p>The CEO is also given the long-term compensation made up of performance shares. The maximum is 130% of the fixed compensation. In that regard, 14,000 Nexans shares were granted to the CEO and the value is EUR 854,562. These are performance shares. The acquisition is over a period of 4 years based on 3 criteria.</p><p>One is economic. It accounts 40%. It has to do with cash, generalized -- cash generation, financial external criterion, another 40%. And this has to do with the performance of the share price compared with a panel of comparable companies. And ESG criteria, 20%, which is based on the achievement of the objectives set in the company's scorecard. Also, the CEO gets other compensation components presented here and there are -- for example, the noncompete clause or the pension, among others.</p><p>Let me move on to the compensation policy for the directors for 2023. The policy is submitted under Resolutions 12 and 13 regarding the directors. First, the compensation policy for directors follows the principles of -- the '22 policy, variable portion prevails with -- it depends on the attendance in Board and committee meetings. The '23 policy for directors remains unchanged from 2022.</p><p>Regarding the climate and lead directors, the Lead Director and the Climate Directors are -- do not get any compensation for their additional missions. Given the increase in their workload, and if compared with the SBF 120 companies, there is a proposal to give them compensation this year for these functions. Compensation would be EUR 35,000 each. Regarding the Chairman of the Board, his compensation remain unchanged in 2023, EUR 320,000 fixed with no any additional compensation whatsoever.</p><p>Now let me move on to the CEO's compensation policy for 2023. It is submitted to your vote in Resolution 14. As I suggested earlier, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer covers a period of 3 years. It remains unchanged in 2023. And as you can see on this slide, it is balanced between the fixed compensation, both short term and long term, and the fixed compensation.</p><p>The fixed compensation, EUR 750,000, unchanged. Variable compensation, 100% of the base salary, and it can reach 150% of the base salary. Structure remains unchanged for 2023, 60% quantitative and collective, 40% individual objectives. Variable compensation with performance shares, maximum 130% of the base salary. And that also remains unchanged for fiscal '23.</p><p>The following resolutions pertain to the employee shareholding plan. These are Resolutions 25 and 26, which pertain to capital increases reserved for employees in France and abroad. As you know, employee shareholding is an important component in the company's social policy. 10 plants that were -- have been launched since 2002. 20% of the employees are currently shareholders and they account for 4% of the company's capital.</p><p>In 2022, Nexans set up a plan with a 2022 to finance environmental projects within Nexans amounting to at least EUR 10 million. Regarding the 2024 plan. The plan aims at once again mobilizing the employees to value creation and strategic plan. And it's under Resolutions 25 and 26, authorization of 500,000 plans. Resolution 25 pertains to our 400,000 shares for the employee shareholding plans beneficiaries. And Resolution 26 has to do with 100,000 shares, to offer comparable conditions to employees in certain foreign subsidiaries. This remains unchanged. This will remain unchanged in 2024.</p><p>The last 2 resolutions pertain to our long-term compensation policy. First, we are looking at performance shares for the CEO and the main managers and free shares without any performance conditions for high-potential employees, or employees who have key expertise for the company. Regarding performance shares, the vesting period is 4 years. And the performance conditions cover a period of 3 years. Performance conditions -- or there are 3 of them.</p><p>First of all, a stock market performance condition and economic and internal condition and the CSR condition to make this in line with the strategic plan of the group. There is not only an EBITDA criterion, and this has been the case until now over a period of 3 years. And there's also a cash conversion criterion -- and there is a condition, cash conversion of at least 40%.</p><p>I'd also like to remind you that the grant of performance shares to the CEO cannot exceed 12% of the total amount in 2023, it was 4.5%. We are therefore submitting to the vote, 300,000 votes. That's 0.7% of the share capital. And regarding free shares, they are to be granted to key experts in the company. And there's only a condition of attendance for a period of 4 years, and we are submitting a maximum of 50,000 shares, i.e., 0.1% of the share capital.</p><p>Okay. I have finished with the presentation of the translations pertaining to corporate governance and compensation, and I thank you for your kind attention.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Thank you, Anne. We're moving on to the statutory auditors, I would like to ask the statutory auditors to give a report.</p><p>And we're going to give the floor to Ms. Juliette Decoux-Guillemot from the Mazars company representing our colleagues, and send their reports to the general meeting.</p><p>JULIETTE DECOUX-GUILLEMOT: Thank you, Chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, dear shareholders, good afternoon. On behalf of the statutory auditors, PwC and Mazars, I'm going to report on -- for the year 2022. I'm going to summarize the main conclusions indicated in our reports. They were made available to you in the notice, and they are in the document -- in the universal registration document. This year, we prepared 9 reports: 3 reports for the ordinary shareholders' meeting and 6 for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Let me start with the reports for the ordinary shareholders' meeting.</p><p>The first report is on the consolidated financial statements. We certified that those consolidated financial statements are fair and regular without any reservations and observations. In this report, we present 3 key points of the audit. We focus on those matters. This year, we have 3 of them: The recognition of the sales and especially the estimation of the long-term contracts; litigations and competition, investigations in progress; and the assessment of the tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets. We checked the information given in the management's report of the group, and we checked the presence of the extra financial declaration presence.</p><p>As far as the second report is concerned, you have the corporate financial statements. We certify that those statements are fair without any reservations and observations. The 2 key points related to the assessment of the participation titles, the competition investigations and litigations. We checked the exactness of the information on the remuneration of the benefits given to the trustees and the commitments to them.</p><p>Our third report for the ordinary meeting itself, a special report on related party agreements. This report has as an objective to communicate the characteristics, modalities and reasons justifying the interest of the related party agreements. And new agreements are submitted to your approval, both of them with investments. The first one for the refund -- the tax refund in Brazil. And the second, long-term commitment of investment on the Board of Directors. Another 2 agreements are also mentioned in our report. We have no observations to make on those 4 related party agreements.</p><p>As far as the 6 reports we have prepared for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting, they regard the Resolutions 18 to 28, and you're going to vote on those resolutions. It's the capital reduction, authorization to increase the share capital, authorization for the international employee shareholding plan, and the grant of performance shares and the grant of free shares. We made those reports, and you will give a delegation to your Board of Directors to proceed to those operations.</p><p>So to summarize, we have no observations to make on the modalities of the operations. And possibly, we issue an additional report during the use of this regulation by your companies.</p><p>So to conclude, on behalf of the colleagues, I would like to thank your companies, and especially financial management for the quality of the closing and the availability. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Thank you very much, statutory auditors. Okay, so we are going to move on to the Q&amp;A session. We're going to answer the questions put in the room and the questions on the website.</p><p>In the room, please wait for the mic. Only the shareholders can -- may ask questions. And we will only answer questions regarding the agenda. So thank you for introducing yourself before asking your questions. Question is in the middle.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good afternoon, Mr. Sergio, individual shareholder. I would like to know the percentage of individual shareholders in the equity of the company. And what is your policy in the future to retain those individual shareholders? Are you going to set up an advisory committee of shareholders?</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: The percentage of individual shareholders. Do we have any exact figure? No, I do not have the figure here on the top of my mind, but I can find it easily. And the second part of your question, we are working on it. We would like to be much more active with our individual shareholders.</p><p>And Nino, I don't know whether you want to add something.</p><p>ANTONINO CUSIMANO: We try to -- we pay attention. We make sure that we can improve our relationship with the individual shareholders. Initiatives are going to be taken. We have already examined this topic with some people. And yes, we would like to improve this relationship, and work is in progress.</p><p>This year, we offered our shareholders to visit Lyon, the research center. The shareholders were contacted. And those who answered positively had the opportunity to visit this research center in Lyon. That's the type of initiatives we take.</p><p>4% of individual shareholders, to answer your question.</p><p>Okay. There is one question in the chat. What about your target to recycle copper in the cables in the 5 years to come?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Okay. May I take these questions? Since it's the first time in the electricity, sorry that the developing and developed countries will have a huge need in copper. You have 3 major electricity producers: gold, copper and aluminum. Copper represents 60% or 70% of the raw material used in cables in the world. Because of this global electrification and this acceleration, because of the energy transition and the renewal of networks, there is a disruption and a possible shortage of copper.</p><p>Two figures. In 1995, the consumption of copper was 9 million tonnes, so all sectors included. 25 years later, this 9 million tonnes became 21 million tonnes. And when we make a projection, the global demand, given all the projects, the European ambition, the Chinese one, the Biden plan, the energy transition, the copper consumption will move from 21 million tonnes to almost 35 million tonnes.</p><p>So of course, there are a lot of copper reserves in the world, which are not -- which have not been tapped into yet, but it is difficult to have access to them. For the time being, it's 22 million tonnes, the global consumption. Unfortunately, this extraction capacity will not follow the same reason as the global consumption. So there might the potential shortage in 2025, 2026.</p><p>In 2028, there would be a regulation, but we'd be missing 4 million or 5 million tonnes in the world. And the only way to offset this shortage and not to increase the carbon footprint of the copper extraction is recycling. We have urban mines as we call them, if we want to renew networks, we have to dismantle networks. So we have to remove all, all the cables installed. And our -- in the '50s from the '50s to the '80s are full of copper. And copper can be recycled indefinitely. That's one advantage.</p><p>This time, well, the circular economy was fashionable. Now it's going to become a necessity, and Nexans will announce in a few months to come huge investments in the field of recycling. We are quite specific compared to our peers and competitors because we kept our metallurgical tools. We directly receive copper from other mines in Chile, in Peru. We smelt the copper to produce this copper bar, which is the core of the cables. And we are announcing investments to increase our recycling capacities, 4% for the time being.</p><p>At the group level, in Canada, we can go up to 12%. And the objective is to have over 30% of recycled copper. It's better for the planet, and it's a way of compensating for this shortage of newly extracted copper. This is our commitment by '24, '25. We try and educate, of course, our customers. We make them understand that if there is a shortage, we'll give access to our capacity mainly to our customers who are already following a circular economy approach.</p><p>A lot of contracts are being signed for the time being with customers. And the objective is your waste of today will be the growth of tomorrow. So bring back your cable waste. We know how to recycle them, thanks to our joint venture with Suez, especially -- notably to recycle polymers and recycle copper as well and to reinject them in the process. So yes, it would be a central topic for the general meeting of the next year, the recycling topic. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good afternoon, the [Dominique Chauvez]. The central theme of the general meeting -- what you're not saying in your answer is if the recycled copper deposit is big enough to offset the shortage you are mentioning given the growth of this hyper cycle -- and it is understandable because the growth will be huge.</p><p>Do we need to secure copper procurement in a different way, for instance, open up new mines or -- so let me ask the same question as last year. Is there a risk or not of such a shortage? Is the recycling possibility big enough? Or is there a real risk? And do we need to find mines and extract copper?</p><p>So what is your commitment towards these resources? And as a futurist and not only a shareholder, of course, it is important to know that. It is important to know the availability of corporate security energy transition.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Thank you very much for this question. We have a better answer than last year, you'll see, because we improved the model. We went around -- we went with Jean-Christophe to visit the largest copper mines in Chile and the mines of our main shareholders. We -- the reserves are significant, but many opening of mines have been postponed for environmental reasons recently.</p><p>From a technical point of view, the capacity of recycled matter is big enough. It's available. It's just a matter of industry. You have 2.5 million tonnes of copper in the form of waste leaving Europe each year for China, because the Chinese who have a huge ambition in terms of energy transition, they have to catch up. And they understood that there will be not enough newly extracted copper to offset -- or to secure the energy transition. So they are capturing a lot of waste everywhere in the world.</p><p>China wanted to deploy the optical fiber worldwide on the domestic market, and they captured within less than 2 years 65% of the global fiber optics. So when they start doing something, they absorb a lot of capacity. So if here in Paris, you have extensions of Metro lines. We had discussions with the IRTP to dismantle old cables in those channels rather than adding new ones and super imposing them to the oldest one -- 30 years old.</p><p>So it's a matter of education we have to explain to them that we need waste. 2.5 million tonnes leaving Europe is 250,000 tonnes leaving France each year in the form of waste for China. So we educate, we convey messages from the BPI -- via BPI to the government to get organized. And it's really problem as well for the automotive industry. With the electric vehicles, they consume twice more copper than the other -- the thermal vehicles. So we want to have an ecosystem of recycling in France and in Europe.</p><p>Europe is ambitious, but has not the natural resources. So there might be a blockage there between the synchronization of this ambition and the implementation of our projects. So many discussions are taking place. And a lot of our customers are getting organized to go along the right line.</p><p>JEAN-CHRISTOPHE JUILLARD: As Chris said, we always had a strong positioning upstream. So because, as you know, we are the only company having kept this vertical access, this metal transformation because this is a competitive edge, and we can really capitalize on it.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Another question? Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible), I wanted to know the correlation between the price of copper and the financial results when copper. When the price of copper increases, well, therefore, the results should not be as good. So I do not really understand the correlation.</p><p>JEAN-CHRISTOPHE JUILLARD: The results are presented, are based on the constant standard price. For 80% of our financial statements, we have the core exposure, the CorEx. This core is a buffer stock made up of small amounts of copper we find in some of our factories. It's a kind of working capital, if you want, and there is no hedging on this amount.</p><p>But the impact is very low compared to the quantity of copper we consume for the production of our cables. And we can find under the operating income in the net income for this portion of nonhedged copper and impact, but it's a tiny part. The remaining amount is hedged. The sales vary, but the current figure varies, but the standard sales, that's flat. And the price is flat, EUR 5,000 each tonne and it is not changed from 1 year to another.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Some years ago, your production could not meet the demand. Given all the calls for tender, for the wind panels, for the nuclear power stations and so on, what about your production of electric cables? Can you respond to all calls for tender in Europe or in the world?</p><p>JEAN-CHRISTOPHE JUILLARD: Well, we are quite selective. We work with less customers, as we said. And we want to densify, to intensify our relationship with the customers. In other words, have more orders to the same customer. I repeated it this year. We went from 13,000 customers -- 17,000 customers down to 4,000 customers. So we reduced -- we got rid of 13,000 customers.</p><p>In Norway, for the subsea cables, there is a huge need, especially also for the subsea interconnection. So demand is going to saturate our capacity, the extension of a factory, which is not over, we are already fully booked until 2025. Our order book is full, and we are going to announce major contracts in the years to come.</p><p>It's good. It's a good sign, a good momentum. It means that the investments were right. And since we promote energy transition, subsea interconnection, this energy -- exchange of green energy between countries, the solar panels, the wind farms. So the demand is quite significant.</p><p>We -- some investors ask why couldn't we multiply by a 3-hour capacity? Back to the question of the gentleman, the demand is going to be exponential. So what we want to do is to adjust our capacity to the supply. If you triple your capacity, you'll have mega factories, but those mega factories will not have access to the natural resources, like copper and aluminum. And it won't be possible to produce. So we want to adjust our capacity to the supply, not to the demand because the demand is exponential.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Fine. So back to the question of my neighbor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Is it possible -- well, given this shift between very strong demand to address the energy transition and what the companies like yours can produce. So there is a gap. And what about the margin power?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Is it -- well, you see the return on capital employed. This ROCE has improved because we've been working on the margin on the selectiveness of our customers. We improved our mix. A lot of customers consumed a lot of our energy for very low profitability. So we decided to get rid of this bad cholesterol. So we wanted to have the good cholesterol, in other words.</p><p>And of course, in being quite selective, the fact that -- given the growth ahead of us, we are extremely selective in terms of customers, the projects, the terms and conditions, their legal and financial terms and conditions. You can call it margin power. We call it selectivity. But of course, it's an additional asset. It is easier to be selective if the market is buoyant.</p><p>Anything else?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Question on indexes, a shareholder. It's -- the #1 shareholder, and you have shared interest with Nexans. Does it secure copper in case of a shortage?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Very good question. I'm speaking here under their supervision. But it is surprising that Augusta, the subsidiary of Nexans own copper mines is not the supplier to Nexans. So the largest supplier of Nexans is called (inaudible). They are in Chile, a very strong producer and copper extractor in Chile. And the goal of our visits precisely was to find alternatives to Codelco and finance through our shareholder other supply possibilities once there is a shortage.</p><p>That's what we did in meetings in Santiago, but we also signed a contract of preferential access with Codelco, and it can be renewed 5 years, in order to have a secure supply in case of a shortage. They guarantee that when there is a shortage, we'll be among the top 3 customers served in the world. So that's the goal of our trip tomorrow.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: How do you make sure that your products are upscaling?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: It is part of the mix effect. Well, the best example -- or the most explicit one is the stop of the cables. We want to have a lot of capacity for the wind farms and we stopped the contracts before our mandate in -- for oil and gas. We just want to have our capacity released for the wind panels and not oil and gas.</p><p>And as Jerome Fournier said, we'll do it gradually. We will move from the PVC cables in the building industry to non -- or flame retardant or nonspreading cables. So that's a mix. Other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You were awarded a lot of bids of offshore wind farms in the U.S., what about Europe and France?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: In the U.S. there is a very strong momentum for the time being. It was -- a huge work was carried out by the Biden government. They wrote down the energy need in electric infrastructure until 2040. So we contributed to that for cables before the elections, and they realized that they need over 20,000 kilometers of cable to install by 2040 on land, plus all cables linked to the offshore wind farms.</p><p>So the U.S. is quite late, but they are catching up a lot. Many projects on the Eastern Coast and on the Western Coast in California, in progress. You have wind farms growing everywhere in the Nevada desert. And you'll have also wind farms in California.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: What about Europe?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: We -- thanks to what has been set up in the last 10 years, the U.K. is the most advanced one in terms of power and capacity of wind farms. And all companies being awarded contracts are European companies: The Norwegian, Orsted, Total, EDF renewable, those European companies have learned in the last 10 years with what has been put into place in the U.K. and in the Northern Europe, and they are exporting this knowledge elsewhere.</p><p>France has advantage and disadvantage. The advantage that we have had decarbonated energy thanks to the nuclear power, mainly investments in the nuclear power are in progress. We are all working -- also working on it. The need for offshore wind farms is not as significant elsewhere, but our energy has been decarbonated for many, many decades.</p><p>And -- but we have to be careful. We should not act too slowly and be lagging behind afterwards. But for the time being, everything is okay. If we keep on having orders like this, we'll keep on investing. But the problem is not the demand. The problem is the access to the natural resources and the capacity of recycling. We have to work on this recycling capacity in the years to come.</p><p>Any further questions? Sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You said that your plant in the U.S. was saturated. So with regard to demand in America, given the Inflation Reduction Act, wouldn't you be tempted to set up a second plant in the U.S.?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GUERIN: Our plants have extension capacities. We generally have 2x more land than what we use. In Charleston, we still have extension opportunities. As to the U.S. uses European companies, and there's a lot that has to do with the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. It's not on the agenda for Nexans right now.</p><p>In 2019, we added EUR 150 million in the plant, that could move, because Nexans is the only player in the U.S. that produces submarine cables to connect offshore wind farms. Now if a U.S. player needs a submarine cable designed and produced by Americans, there's only Nexans that can offer that. So it's good for us, serendipity as it were.</p><p>Now we're trying to put capacity on the right level because there's -- regarding offshore wind farms, well, we're going to try to saturate the plant first, and then we'll see whether further extensions can be considered.</p><p>JEAN MOUTON: Fine. Any other questions? Fine. Okay. Well, as there are no further questions, I hereby close the Q&amp;A section. And I suggest we move on to vote on the resolutions. So the number of shares -- we have more than 81.91% of the shares with voting rights. So a very high number, therefore.</p><p>Okay. Now I give the floor to Nino Cusimano, who's going to guide us through the voting procedure.</p><p>ANTONINO CUSIMANO: Thank you, Chairman. So, let me tell you about the electronic voting procedure.

The actress' friends are now expecting hernew boyfriend to pop the question in the coming months, an unnamed insider told Entertainment Tonight.\"MGK and Megan make each other laugh and that's a big thing for Megan,\" the source told ET[1]. \"They keep each other smiling. MGK totally sees marriage in his future with Megan and friends could 100% see them getting engaged within the next year.\"The sourcenoted that Fox does not haveengagement and marriage in mind just yet, but her relationship with Kellyis apparently better compared to the one she had withGreen.\"Megan doesn't think about getting engaged [or] married and she doesn't put a timeline in place and it's not something that really crosses her mind,\" the tipster said.\"They are going strong, but Megan is the type of person who likes to keep her partners on their toes so one day she can be super hot and another, she can be cold. </p><p>MGK doesn't mind the back and forth and they're definitely more 'on' than 'off' on most days. Megan's relationship with MGK is healthier than her relationship with Brian was, especially during their last year together,\" the source continued.The insider added that Fox and Kelly understand andleanon each other emotionally. They also sharea strong connection because they are both parents andempathize with each other in terms of their careers, parenthood and other issues. Kelly apparently felt that he was going down a bad path before he met Fox, according to the source. Kelly earlier opened up about how having Fox around helped him with his drug abuse recovery, especially during'dark nights.'\"When you have a partner, mine being Megan, sitting there with you on those dark nights when you're sweating and not being able to figure out why you're so in your head, to help you get out of your head and put it in perspective, that really, really helps,\" he explained[2].Meanwhile, the \"Transformers\" star said thatloving Kelly was like a \"tsunami or forest fire.\"\"The intensity of merging with him is just overwhelming, and the threat it poses is so powerful but so beautiful that you have no choice to surrender with reverence and with gratitude,\" she toldNylon[3] in November.

This opportunity will support Edgybees' efforts to deliver real-time, high-precision geo-tagging for aerial images and video that provide timely and accurate situational awareness for mission-critical operations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New for 2021, the four-week AWS Space Accelerator curriculum provides hands-on AWS Cloud and technical training, mentorship, coaching, and business support in collaboration with Seraphim, one of the world's leading investment groups focused exclusively on the space industry, who will provide business development and investment guidance.</p><p>The explosion of aerial assets such as drones, helicopters, and airplanes has expanded the availability of imagery and video during critical missions such as natural disasters, emergency incidents, and precision military operations. Yet despite massive investments in excess of a trillion dollars a year, the vast majority of aerial imagery and video footage go unused due to lack of accurate geographical context.</p><p>Since telemetry data from the aerial assets themselves is notoriously inaccurate, erroneous information is often displayed to pilots and operators who are making crucial decisions under pressure with life or death consequences. Lacking accurate geolocation information, operators may struggle to pinpoint the location of a trapped family in a hurricane, a hiker lost in a remote area, or a residential building in a forest fire area.</p><p>Edgybees helps solve this problem by analyzing incoming visual information and matching it with real-time GIS telemetry, with accuracy as high as 1 meter and as little as 120 milliseconds latency. Unlike other solutions that require expensive proprietary GIS data, the Edgybees solution is utilizing commercial-grade satellite-generated GIS data, making the solution highly affordable and generating additional revenue streams for satellite operators. Optimized for the cloud, the Edgybees software and APIs have been successfully deployed on the AWS cloud platform with major defense integrators and customers across the globe.</p><p>\"We are extremely excited to be selected for the AWS Space Accelerator and collaborate with AWS to deliver advanced decision-support solutions at the scale and speed that are a must for lifesaving and mission-critical operations,\" said Adam Kaplan, Edgybees' co-founder and CEO. \"Running on AWS streamlines the integration of our software into existing systems used by customers, delivering immediate improvement of their geo-registration accuracy and reliability without modifying their workflows and operating procedures.\"</p><p>As one of 10 companies chosen for this opportunity, Edgybees will receive up to $100,000 inAWS Activatecredit, AWS Cloud training and support, mentorship, and additional business development resources including opportunities to speak with space-savvy venture investors.</p><p>\"AWS looks forward to collaborating with our finalists to advance their inspiring vision for transforming how we understand, operate in, and benefit from space,\" said Clint Crosier, director of the Aerospace and Satellite business at AWS. \"Congratulations to our finalists, who were selected from hundreds of impressive startups from across the global space industry. The cloud is uniquely suited to spur the success of space companies in so many ways, and we are excited to help these companies achieve their biggest goals.\"</p><p>Proposals were judged on several factors including the innovative and unique nature of the project, the overall value the solution will bring to the space industry, the creative application of AWS to solve problems, and the team's ability to deliver on its specific mission.</p><p>For more information on the AWS Space Accelerator, visit<url normalizedValue=\"https://seraphim.vc/aws/accelerator/\">https://seraphim.vc/aws/accelerator/</url>.</p><p>About EdgybeesFounded in 2017, Edgybees brings clarity, accuracy, and speed to mission-critical and lifesaving operations that rely on streamed aerial video for situational awareness.

My heart broke for my 80-year-old patient, a devoted father and grandfather, as he lay dying from COVID-19, alone in his hospital room. To limit the spread of the lethal virus, he was surrounded only by the beeping machines and an iPad broadcasting his last moments to his family.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My heart breaks for the families who are missing one of the more than 300,000 people who have died this year from COVID-19. These hundreds of thousands of people will be missing from dinners and celebrations this bittersweet holiday season.</p><p>Unfortunately, these families do not have a choice: Their Christmas and holidays will be smaller and lonelier. But for those of us who do, we must voluntarily choose to keep our holiday celebrations smaller, limited only to immediate household members, so that our future celebrations are not scarred by the death of loved ones.</p><p>We failed Thanksgiving test</p><p>This is not the year to travel and visit family for the holidays. COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to be at an all-time high. Mobile morgues are being used because the regular morgues are full. More ominously, hospitals are stretched to capacity with COVID-19 cases.</p><p>According to data from the Department of Health and Human Services, in more than 100 counties around the country, hospital occupancy exceeds 90%! This is straining the health care system and exhausting doctors and nurses, and could lead to more deaths as PPE and specialists trained to operate ventilators dwindle.</p><p>We need to slow the spread of the virus. We failed at Thanksgiving. Despite pleas from medical experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay at home, there were a record number of flights this year.</p><p>Don't fuel COVID fire</p><p>On the Sunday after Thanksgiving alone, almost 1.2 million people flew on packed airplanes. Already in the midst of a surge, cases continue to rise and we are beginning to see the \"surge upon surge\" that Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted from these Thanksgiving get-togethers.</p><p>There is hope on the horizon. Vaccines are rolling out, but it is important to realize that wide distribution will not be for weeks or months. Plenty of death and devastation can happen in the meantime. In addition, vaccines will be more effective and quicker in controlling the pandemic in an environment where the incidence of COVID-19 cases is lower.</p><p>President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, put it well. \"If I have a cup of water, I can put out a stove fire,\" she tweeted. \"But I can't put out a forest fire, even if that water is 100% potent.\"</p><p>Let us not fuel this continuing fire that is the COVID-19 pandemic. This holiday season, we need to stay at home and not risk further viral spread by visiting family. I had recently written a similar plea to stay home and opt for a virtual Thanksgiving and received a nice letter from a retired educator thanking me for \"giving permission\" not to gather for the holiday. She shared the piece with her family so they could understand that it was not for lack of love, but because of love that she was staying away.</p><p>Please show your family this column. I am again giving permission -- actually, this time, I am giving doctor's orders: Opt for virtual Christmas and holidays, and please do not travel. Stay at home to celebrate.</p><p>Dr. Thomas K.

One reason for that is the blaze hit close to home for fire experts. As many as 100 scientists studying wildfires, smoke, air pollution and climate change lived in or near Louisville and Superior, the two towns where over 1,000 homes were destroyed. Many of the scientists work for five national laboratories in the Boulder area run by NOAA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Others do research for the University of Colorado, where the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences often partners with federal agencies on climate-related projects. </p><p>\"We began realizing that there just isn't much science out there in terms of guidance,\" explained Michael Hannigan, an engineering professor at the University of Colorado. \"So we thought why not try to do some science, really fast? We live in one of the places that's arguably the best in the world for atmospheric science.\" They are finding that the Dec. 30 fire, which burned 1,084 homes to the ground and spread flaming embers, toxic ashes and gases over a much wider area, exposed a large gap in knowledge of the risks of living in what scientists call the \"wildland urban interface.\" These are often densely populated towns that have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years near forests or other wild areas along both coasts of the U.S. and in the vicinity of the Gulf of Mexico. While there has been a great deal of research on wildfires and how they burn, there have been relatively few studies on what happens when the wildfires reach urban areas. The Marshall Fire \"burned a densely populated suburban area where most residents had not previously considered wildfire a threat,\" Becky Bolinger, Colorado's assistant state climatologist, concluded after reviewing the fire damage. The changing climate had a lot to do with the lack of awareness in Louisville and Superior. A record-setting snowpack in the winter of 2020 followed by a wet spring and summer resulted in a 70 percent increase in grasses growing in large meadows near Marshall Lake, about 7 miles away. Then a record drought hit the area in late fall and winter of 2021. It turned the grasslands into what amounted to kindling, waiting for a spark. It came (from still unknown sources) on Dec. 30. The flames and embers were driven by 100-mph wind gusts toward the two towns. \"It's the first time in my career I have felt comfortable saying this is a climate fire,\" concluded Natasha Stavros, director of a laboratory at the University of Colorado that focuses on multidisciplinary science problems. High winds are relatively common in the area, but the deluge that was later followed by a severe drought isn't. They created what she calls a \"domino effect\" that hadn't been seen before. \"This particular community is not in places that most people would think of as wildlands,\" she said. She expects the changes will result in new laws. \"Just as we have flood zones, we will have fire zones and people won't be allowed to build in certain areas,\" she said. The thick smoke from burning houses inspired Joost de Gouw, a chemistry professor, to obtain a quick grant from the university to analyze the remains of the blaze. He has found it spread residues from plastic, metals, car tires, fried shingles, melted batteries and a spectrum of other materials that were destroyed by intense heat. The result is more toxic than what a forest fire would leave, he explained in an interview. Friends of his who lived in the burned-out area are still bothered by strange scents in the air six weeks after the fire. They worry about health effects - and they should, de Gouw said. The pollutants will likely become airborne again on windy days and when remaining homes are being cleaned and ashes of destroyed houses are being removed. He has put instruments into 11 surviving houses to measure smoke damage, and he rolled mass spectrometers down nearby streets. They are machines designed to measure and identify pollutants. \"We have a lot of homework ahead of us,\" de Gouw said. The National Science Foundation (NSF) sends out teams of skilled researchers around the world to quickly explore unusual disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. Brad Wham, who teaches civil engineering at the University of Colorado, has been summoned to study events in Japan and New Zealand. Grants to support research usually take up to a year to be approved, but Wham got the call while he was evacuating from his home in Louisville. The fires were burning a few hundred yards away. This was the first wildland fire that the NSF has responded to, Wham pointed out in an interview. \"That's very exciting.\" He was put on a team examining the relative flammability of different kinds of houses. He also used drones to study the landscape around them. He managed to get his first aerial survey aloft before a snowstorm covered the burned areas. \"We have some very good data on where the fire moved in from an open space and burned a number of homes,\" said Wham, whose own home escaped harm. Wham also talked to firefighters who battled the burning homes and credits them with preventing even more damage by the racing blaze. They hosed down a particular set of houses. That kept the flames from moving into an adjoining area of homes. Erica Fischer, a structural engineer from Oregon State University, was a member of Wham's team and examined which types of houses sustained the most damage from flaming embers. She said the results will appear shortly in a study that is likely to spawn more research. \"We are going into the field to rapidly collect data and get it out into the public,\" she explained. Most of the research on wildfires up to now has been largely supported by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Local communities will have to better understand the growing wildfire risks to minimize urban exposure, she said. \"That's the goal. Fires tend to come back to the same place over and over again. It's important that right after a fire that mitigation provisions are put in place, so you don't have these large losses within the community,\" Fischer said. Maxwell Cook is working on a doctorate at the University of Colorado with a focus on wildfire impacts around the world. Between 1990 and 2015, he estimates, people living in wildland urban interface areas grew by 32 million in the U.S. The Marshall Fire, he calculates, burned 6,000 acres, making it less than half the size of the second-biggest wildfire in Colorado's history. Yet it destroyed 39 percent of all the homes lost to Colorado wildfires since 1999, making it the state's most destructive wildfire. The city of Louisville's Public Works and Utilities Department published a report in January, however, suggesting that the two cities may have been lucky. Between Dec. 30 and 31, a nine-person team spent 18 hours waging a battle against falling water pressure. If they failed, the firefight could have stalled. Blackouts crippled two water plants serving the area, and water pressure was dropping at the third. The agreed-on solution, according to the report, was: \"We gotta try something.\" Untreated reservoir water was pumped into the system from the remaining water plant. But pressure kept dropping. Then at 1 a.m. Dec. 30, three team members drove into the burning area. As firefighters left fire-damaged homes, the public works team hunted through the ruins to find and manually shut off water mains that were feeding leaking pipes. Without that, more of Louisville (population 21,226) and Superior (population 12,921) \"would have been lost,\" the report said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000017ee15cdce9abffef5c45490000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:650K-7T41-JDGB-0001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1300\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 14, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Launched in 2009, the 54-year-old's podcast catapulted him to fame and earned him a $100 million licensing deal[3] with Spotify. However, Rogan's superstar status doesn't come without a good amount of scandal. </p><p><br/>The UFC host isn't afraid to say what he believes whether it's correct or not. Here are the most controversial things Rogan has done and said. <br/>Joe Rogan was a standup comedian before he became a podcast host <br/>Joe Rogan prepares to host UFC 249 in 2020 | Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images <br/>In 1994, Rogan moved from Newark, New Jersey, to LA to pursue a career in standup comedy. His first nationally televised performance took place on MTV's Half-Hour Comedy Hour. A year later, NBC sitcom NewsRadio[4] cast him as handyman Joe Garrelli. In 2001, the kickboxing enthusiast became a UFC commentator and the host of the popular Fear Factor reality show. Rogan hosted Fear Factor[5] for seven seasons from 2001-06 and 2011-12. <br/>In 2009, The Joe Rogan Experience podcast launched. Sirius XM acquired the show in 2011. By October 2015, the podcast received a whopping 16 million downloads, garnering more fans than nearly any other podcast on air. The global pandemic spurred even more interest in podcasting.  <br/>Spotify recognized the growth and bought Rogan's podcast for $100 million in 2020. Since moving to the audio streaming platform, Rogan has continued to gain loyal listeners. He also receives a lot of hate due to the controversy he seems to relish creating. <br/>Joe Rogan's top controversies <br/>Joe Rogan to the media: 'The answer is not to silence me,' it's for 'you to do better'<url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/nOTmiQ5iTs\">https://t.co/nOTmiQ5iTs</url>[6] \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) February 11, 2022[7] <br/>The Sun[8] reported on Rogan's most controversial moments, which often stem from his conversations with guests on his podcast. Here are several of them: <br/>Smoking weed with Elon Musk: In 2018, Rogan had Musk on his show for a three-hour interview. The UFC host offered Musk a spliff, which is a mixture of marijuana and tobacco, and Musk took a puff.[9] The show is recorded in California where recreational use of marijuana is legal.However , many people were incensed by the brazen drug use.Welcoming Alex Jones: Alex Jones is a well-known conspiracy theorist. Rogan hosted an interview with Jones in October 2020 where they discussed mask-wearing and the possible risk of vaccines.Forest fire claims: On the episode with British author Douglas Murray, Rogan made the claim that 'left-wing activists' deliberately started the forest in California, Washington, and Oregon.Transphobia: Rogan has made numerous comments through the years that are problematic for the trans community.Racist language: Rogan is shown in a video explaining how he and his friends were dropped off in a Black neighborhood. Rogan can be heard saying, 'We got out, and it was like we were in Africa, like we were in Planet of the Apes.'Misogyny: Rogan hosted Dave Chappelle[10] in February 2003. The pair went out in New York in search of women with great breasts. <br/>Rogan's most controversial statements involve the coronavirus pandemic and his use of racial slurs. It's spurred many famous actors, singers, and writers to call for his cancelation.  <br/>Celebrities want Rogan removed from Spotify<br/>Joe Rogan Rips Into Justin Trudeau For 'Demonizing' The Unvaccinated <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/PwX1zjjQ0a\">https://t.co/PwX1zjjQ0a</url>[11] pic.twitter.com/O8IzdWmwQD[12] \u2014 Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) February 13, 2022[13]; <br/>In lieu of several comments made by Rogan on his podcast, many celebrities are calling for Spotify to remove him[14] from their available podcasts. Some music artists are even choosing to remove themselves from the platform if Rogan does not leave. <br/>India Arie is removing her music and podcast from Spotify, according to Insider[15]. The singer shared a clip of Rogan repeatedly using the N-word on his podcast. She posted on Instagram: 'I have decided to pull my music and podcast from Spotify. Neil Young opened a door that I MUST walkthrough. I believe in freedom of speech. However, I find Joe Rogan problematic for reasons other than his Covid interviews. For me, it's also his language around race.' <br/>Arie goes on to explain, 'Paying musicians a fraction of a penny? And HIM $100M? This shows the type of company they are and the company that they keep. I'm tired.' Notably, she named Neil Young[16] as the push she needed to leave the streaming platform. Young gave an ultimatum to Spotify in January 2020 that they had to choose between offering Rogan's music or his.  <br/>The 'Harvest Moon' singer could not support Spotify if they continued to support Rogan and his statements about COVID-19 specifically. Subsequently, Young removed his music from the platform after the streaming platform did not remove Rogan's podcast. Joni Mitchell joined Young in leaving in protest of Spotify continuing to host Rogan and his controversial stance on the global pandemic.  <br/>RELATED: Inside Joe Rogan's Carnivore Diet and Why He Does It[17] <br/> Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[18] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet\">https://www.cheatsheet</url> .com/tag/joe-rogan/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-much-money-does-joe-rogan-make-per-podcast-episode.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-much-money-does-joe-rogan-make-per-podcast-episode.html/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogans-move-to-spotify-hasnt-helped-his-long-term-influence-according-to-engagement-numbers.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogans-move-to-spotify-hasnt-helped-his-long-term-influence-according-to-engagement-numbers.html/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-deeply-traumatized-murder-costar-friend-phil-hartman.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-deeply-traumatized-murder-costar-friend-phil-hartman.html/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/fear-factor-joe-rogan-fans-shocked-by-youthful-looks.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/fear-factor-joe-rogan-fans-shocked-by-youthful-looks.html/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/nOTmiQ5iTs\">https://t.co/nOTmiQ5iTs</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1492258393045622784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1492258393045622784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17562430/joe-rogan-most-shocking-moments-racist-language-weed/\">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17562430/joe-rogan-most-shocking-moments-racist-language-weed/</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-recalls-the-time-elon-musk-smoked-weed-on-his-podcast-im-like-oh-no-what-have-i-done.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-recalls-the-time-elon-musk-smoked-weed-on-his-podcast-im-like-oh-no-what-have-i-done.html/</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/fans-are-protesting-dave-chappelles-new-standup-special-due-to-past-controversies.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/fans-are-protesting-dave-chappelles-new-standup-special-due-to-past-controversies.html/</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/PwX1zjjQ0a\">https://t.co/PwX1zjjQ0a</url> [ 12]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/O8IzdWmwQD\">https://t.co/O8IzdWmwQD</url> [ 13]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDailyWire/status/1492696301124812801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/realDailyWire/status/1492696301124812801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 14]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/spotify-ceo-says-company-will-not-change-policies-based-media-cycle-following-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/spotify-ceo-says-company-will-not-change-policies-based-media-cycle-following-joe-rogan-vaccine-misinformation.html/</url> [ 15]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insider.com/india-arie-asks-spotify-remove-music-joe-rogan-n-word-2022-2\">https://www.insider.com/india-arie-asks-spotify-remove-music-joe-rogan-n-word-2022-2</url> [ 16]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/neil-young-wants-music-off-spotify-joe-rogans-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-rogan-young.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/neil-young-wants-music-off-spotify-joe-rogans-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-rogan-young.html/</url> [ 17]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/inside-joe-rogan-carnivore-diet-why-he-does-it.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/inside-joe-rogan-carnivore-diet-why-he-does-it.html/</url> [ 18]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-top-controversies-n-word-covid-misinformation-spotify-100-million-problem-child.html/\">https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-top-controversies-n-word-covid-misinformation-spotify-100-million-problem-child.html/</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

In addition to the emergency services, local aid organizations and other volunteers, football fans have been using their organizational abilities to help out.In Erftstadt-Bliesheim, the clouds have been replaced by blue sky, the rain by a baking sun - and a picturesque Rhineland village by rubble. </p><p><br/>The tiny town between Cologne and Bonn, population 3,600, was devastated by the floods which hit western Germany last week when the small River Erft swelled to historic levels and burst its banks. <br/>Days later, residents are picking through the wreckage, trying to salvage what they can of their livelihoods with the help of the emergency services, local aid organizations and volunteers from near and far. Among them, around 200 supporters of nearby Bundesliga club FC Cologne. <br/>\"We want to help people,\" says Kai, wearing a t-shirt with the message \"Zesamme stark blieve\" - \"stay strong together\" in the local dialect - beneath Cologne's club badge. \"If you were in this situation, you'd like someone to help you; it's about looking out for your neighbors.\" <br/>The fans' efforts are being coordinated by the \"Coloniacs,\" one of Cologne's hardcore ultra groups, usually known for their vocal support, flags and choreographies at Bundesliga matches. <br/>On Friday, the group appealed for donations in the form of blankets, shoes, clothing and money. By the next day, over \u20ac20,000 ($23,500) had been donated and the group had to ask people to stop donating material goods because they had reached storage capacity. By Wednesday morning, they had collected over \u20ac35,000. <br/><br/>Cologne, Leverkusen, Dortmund, Hannover and more <br/>The Cologne ultras aren't on their own. Further up the Rhine, the \"Ultras Leverkusen\" also appealed for donations, saying: \"Parts of Leverkusen are currently in the sort of state we have never seen before. Our neighbors, our friends, our family, our city need help.\" <br/>And in the formerly industrial Ruhr region, Borussia Dortmund supporters from the \"B\u00fcndnis S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne\" - an alliance of fan and ultra groups from the club's famous Yellow Wall - also appealed for help. <br/>\"This terrible catastrophe has affected many thousands of people and has taken everything from them,\" read a statement from the fans which was shared by the club. \"Borussia Dortmund fans have always stood together in difficult times and have shown solidarity. And that's exactly what we're going to do now.\" <br/>By Tuesday, 27 palettes and 90 bags of material had been donated and were on their way to Erftstadt or to Hagen, another badly affected town just to the south of Dortmund. <br/>Even fans of clubs from non-affected regions have got involved. Hannover fans from the \"Rote Kurve\" group, for example, are collecting donations and splitting them 50-50 between the Coloniacs in Erftstadt and local aid organizations further south in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. <br/><br/>Ultras: more than just football fans <br/>Ultras don't necessarily enjoy the best reputation among the general public. <br/>Their appearance and style of support at football matches - loud and raucous with flags, banners and pyrotechnics - isn't everybody's cup of tea, and they are vocal critics of what they perceive to be the over-commercialization of the modern game. In many parts of Eastern Europe, ultra groups can be explicitly right-wing and often violent, although most German ultras tend to be on the political left: critical and uncomfortable but with a strong sense of social responsibility. <br/>\"This is a common trait of the ultra movement around the world,\" says James Montague, author of \"Among the Ultras: A journey with the world's most extreme fans.\" <br/>\"Whether it's an earthquake in Croatia, a forest fire in Greece or floods in Germany, ultra groups are often on the front line,\" he says. <br/>Indeed, when the coronavirus arrived in Germany last spring, forcing cities into lockdowns, ultras from football clubs across the country were among the first groups to organize support for vulnerable people, doing shopping, looking after pets and generally helping out. <br/>\"These are extremely well-organized groups, often consisting of physically fit young men,\" explains Montague. \"They have a natural organizational structure and can organize things in a short space of time, from communications to collections to distribution - these things are part and parcel of what they do.\" <br/><br/>'We're not all bad' <br/>Back in Erftstadt, the Cologne ultras have been deployed around the affected areas, carrying, cleaning, clearing and assisting where they can. They've been here all day, and they'll be back again tomorrow. <br/>\"There are so many people out there who you don't even know, I don't even know where they're from,\" one resident told DW. \"But they're out here helping to clean up, there's so much willingness to help, it's wonderful.\" <br/>For Kai and the others, it's a natural response. <br/>\"We could be at home having a barbeque by the pool, but we're here, because that's what we do,\" he said. \"The nasty football fans well maybe people will see that we're not all bad.\" <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109993162686165129025879100024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7831</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6366-F9H1-F03R-N47C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567699</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle Sports</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 21, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

The images show burning forests, fire crews and residents of the areas who were affected by the fires.</p><p>Sanders said he was also inspired by his work with environmental education. Sanders said he works with organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America to spread awareness of environmental issues such as fires, flooding or invasive species.</p><p>The exhibit, Sanders said, could have been done on a historical, global or national scale. Ultimately, Sanders said the decision was made to focus on the Camp Fire due to the humanitarian impact of the fire.</p><p>\"That's why we went with Camp Fire, because it was so prominent,\" Sanders said.</p><p>Tim Broekema, a photojournalism professor, outlined his hopes for his students with the exhibit.</p><p>More from this section</p><p>Lady Gaga to Oprah: I was repeatedly raped at 19</p><p>Jake Tapper presses Secy.

Last year saw the highest annual accumulated FFDI on record. Australia was the first country in the world to report the impact of climate change on bushfires through CSIRO's work to model the increase in high fire danger days.</p><p>During Senate Estimates last week, CSIRO was asked specifically about the Climate Change in Australia (2015) report and if it has undertaken any explicit studies to attribute the Australian increase in fire weather to climate change since that report.

My name is Shane O'Neill, and I serve as the Forest Industry Business Development Manager at the University of Maine: an R1 research university; the state's land, sea, and space grant; and a proud member of the Association of Public and</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Land Grant Universities (APLU), which helped invite me here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for the opportunity to testify on workforce challenges and opportunities in the forestry and conservation sectors, an issue of great importance to our state, which is nearly 90% forested - a number relatively unchanged since European settlement. Since then, Maine's forest has provided an ever-evolving suite of products of the highest quality to the world, as has our nearly 3,500 miles of coastline. The past and future health of Maine's rural communities is highly dependent on our so-called \"heritage industries\": farming, fishing, and forestry. Leveraging the vast natural resources from our fields, woods, and waters to sustain these special places through these sectors relies entirely upon our ability to innovate and access to skilled human capital.</p><p>Currently, Maine's forest products industry employs more than 13,000 people across the state. But the nature of the industry, and the jobs it supports, is rapidly changing - in great part through data-driven modernization, application of Al and increasingly sophisticated technologies - and so too must our education and training practices of our future and incumbent workforce.</p><p>Three key factors have converged over the last few decades that created the urgency, and opportunity, to transition to our next phase: a sustainable forest bioeconomy. They are not unique to Maine, nor are our strategies for moving forward. First, the impacts of climate change on forest health are increasingly evident, whether it is through temperature, drought, fire, invasive pests, muddy roads from early thaws that prevent passage of logs and equipment or heavy rain events. How we manage our forest resources and extend their application will require new practices, techniques and be technology driven. Second, the transition to a digital information age has drastically reduced the demand for print and graphic paper. Mills that couldn't adapt to these changing markets closed, causing their workers - more than 7,600 over the last 20 years just in Maine - to lose their livelihoods. Third, there is a growing understanding that sustainably managed forests and their products are a pathway to reduce carbon emissions, both in sequestration in a growing forest, and storage in long life cycle forest products. Adapting the management of our forests and advanced products manufacturing has become more technically intensive with increasing processing automation, advanced material science and engineering, remote sensing, machine learning modeling, and growth forecasting using advanced artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>From these realizations and changing markets, exciting opportunities are emerging that if we strategically partner, invest, and innovate, will ultimately diversify, strengthen, and sustain the forest economy and the communities dependent upon it. Accelerating innovation in forest products and training a skilled workforce which meets the current and emerging needs of these new products and practices is key to meeting the increasing global demand for low-carbon materials, chemicals, and fuels that can come from forests</p><p>Currently, public perceptions and attitudes demonstrate a disconnect from the reality of modern forestry. Many people view forest management, harvesting, and products manufacture as ecologically detrimental, and requiring low-tech, high-exertion labor. Some of these perceptions are informed by images from long ago, where strength and brawn were the tools required to be successful, and sustainability wasn't standard practice. In reality, the engine of the modern forest economy is knowledge: utilizing technology, automation, science and engineering to increase the precision and positive impact of forest management practices and commercialize new forest-based processes and value-added products under the most sustainable and environmentally friendly means possible. For example, the University of Maine is pioneering the development and commercialization of value-added forest bioproducts manufactured from low-value forest residuals, including cellulosic nanofibrils for use in a multitude of products, biofuels such as diesel and jet fuel directly offsetting petrochemical consumption, and advanced materials including large scale 3D-printed bioproducts for use in transportation infrastructure, housing and manufacturing.</p><p>To build from our traditional assets and strengths and strategically transition our entire forest products sector through innovation and global assessment, in 2016 a unique cross-sector collaboration called Forest Opportunity Roadmap/Maine (FOR/Maine) was initiated between industry, communities, government, education, and nonprofits with support from the U.S. Economic Development Administration and our Maine Congressional Delegation.</p><p>As a founding member of FOR/Maine with extensive expertise, broad relationships, statewide reach, and research and development capacity across the forest economy and beyond (including that supported by Mclntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry through USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture), the University of Maine is critical to this collaboration, providing knowledge-based information and innovations to deliver on FOR/Maine's strategic objectives. And, as the largest generator of graduates in the state, we can most impact the size and skill of the workforce for this sector (and most others in Maine). To facilitate partnership and progress, the university created the position of Forest Industry Business Development Manager - the job I currently hold. By serving as a focused sector advocate with subject matter expertise and access to the full span of scientists and engineers within our system, my work plays an important role in bringing diverse stakeholders together to assess industry and community needs, and collaboratively develop solutions that address needs and include all vested voices, including those historically excluded.</p><p>Not surprisingly, preparing the workforce for the future forest products economy is one of the primary goals identified by FOR/Maine, and our high-level strategies toward this include attracting young people into the industry in our oldest-in-the-nation state; ensuring that new, replacement, and incumbent workers have the skills needed for existing jobs, and preparing the workforce for emerging products and technologies in the industry. To inform how we specifically do this, I joined colleagues from UMaine's Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center and the University of Southern Maine Center for Business and Economic Research to develop the first-of-its kind forest industry workforce development strategy through analysis of current and projected workforce and population trends, defining skill demands for current and emerging careers, and directed surveys and interviews with forest industry employers in the state.</p><p>Our research determined that by 2035, 37% of Maine's current forest economy workforce will be at or beyond retirement age, with the oldest workers currently concentrated in harvesting and logging. This translates to approximately 5,000 positions that will need to be filled in the next 15 years. As the older workforce exits, they take with them decades of learned experience that is not easily replicable, compelling companies to identify new ways to help transfer knowledge and train younger employees. Furthermore, as Maine transitions into newer emerging technologies, it is estimated that an additional 2,600 positions will be added. Many of these will be highly skilled, specialized STEM positions like photogrammetry, industrial engineers, process technicians, and programmers. However, it should be noted that in a recent UMaine study of 177 forest product firms referenced in our report noted a strong need for employee soft skills such as managing uncertainty, flexibility, adaptability, along with communication, data-based decision making and digital skills. Professional development must include both the technical and soft skills to increase employee success.</p><p>To meet this need, our report recommends the development of workforce pipelines through six strategic actions, many of which may be relevant in your own districts and states for this and other traditional industries:</p><p>1) Design, prepare, and execute a coordinated marketing and branding campaign that showcases the career opportunities in forest products in Maine, as careers in the sector are often overlooked in part because of the negative publicity in recent years due to mill closures or perceptions about the types of jobs available;</p><p>2) Foster greater education, outreach, and awareness of opportunities in the forest products sector to Maine secondary school students and advisors, leveraging the younger generation's interest in sustainability and stewardship;</p><p>3) Cultivate out-of-state workforce pipelines and integrate with statewide attraction and recruitment efforts, including from labor pools in forest product cluster regions elsewhere, Veterans looking to resettle after their service, and those who enjoy the outdoors;</p><p>4) Leverage existing workforce infrastructure to increase coordination and engagement and expand existing internship, apprenticeship, and training programs including through university research learning experiences and inclusion of justice or substance impacted individuals;</p><p>5) Community placemaking is important in workforce attraction and retention including access to affordable housing and quality health care; and</p><p>6) Maintain systems to continuously monitor and evaluate workforce conditions and requirements across the industry to be responsive in developing and adapting workforce development initiatives.</p><p>To advance these actions, and further develop and scale our FOR/Maine efforts, UMaine is currently leading our coalition in pursuing EDA Build Back Better funding to develop a Northern Forest bioeconomy cluster, and recently submitted our Phase II proposal.</p><p>Our work, and the workforce we are developing, has never been more essential to Maine and our nation's ability to sustainably manage and utilize our nation's forest resources, mitigate forest fire and invasive risks, sequester carbon, improve clean air, water, and habitat, and protect the economic foundation and identity of many rural communities.</p><p>In closing, I would like to again thank the Committee and APLU for the opportunity to speak with you today, and for your interest and support of our nation's forests and the citizens and communities reliant on its rich resources. I look forward to answering your questions.

My stupid little actions aren't even helping with this deep sense of loneliness I have. How can I help with the new bubonic plague? What do I do when everything feels out of control?\u00a0</p><p>If almost buying hair dye online and then talking myself out of it doesn't work, I clean. One day, I put on my combination Lizzo/Nickelback motivational playlist and some rubber gloves and got to work deep-cleaning my closet.</p><p>After digging through layers of high school binders and stress-tear-stained band sheet music like some kind of sad paleontologist, the Silly Bandz and Tiger Beat magazines told me I had reached the middle school era. I was bracing myself for deeply embarrassing drawings of David Tennant, but nothing could have prepared me for what I found instead. Shimmering, covered in turquoise and magenta cases and grime, there were dozens and dozens of Bath &amp; Body Works hand sanitizer bottles from the early 2010s. I had found it: the pandemic holy grail.\u00a0</p><p>Like a ravenous beast, I ripped open bottles and poured the sweet nectar onto my hands, my arms, my head - anything to soak up the precious juices. Drunk on power and rubbing alcohol, my pulse pounded as I contemplated my newly held responsibility. People search their whole quarantine lives for just a drop of hand sanitizer. Here I was, boasting 10 litres of it - sparkles and the sweet, nauseating stench of Chocolate Creme Donut included. A sense of self-righteous purpose came over me.</p><p>I knew what I needed to do.\u00a0</p><p>I tied a bandana over my nose and mouth, smeared fallen forest fire ash under my eyes like war paint, and sprinted out of my driveway.\u00a0</p><p>Chucking hand sanitizer bottles at houses and passerbys like a punch-drunk Newsie, I ran through neighbourhood streets sharing my good news with anyone six feet away that would listen. The gift of cleanliness was too important to be hoarded; it was my responsibility to share this with the world. Did I hit the windshields of oncoming traffic, hindering their vision with the pink, sparkling contents of a Cherry Apple bottle reminiscent of a bludgeoned fairy? Maybe. But I also gave the driver peace of mind.</p><p>Skipping through the streets, tossing bottles over my shoulders with abandon, I felt like I had found my true Sweet Pea-scented purpose amongst the chaos.\u00a0</p><p>I threw almost every bottle I had at my neighbours that day . . . except for one. I placed it right in front of my door on a table to use. Now, every time I walk home, all worries about the pandemic and online classes and smoke and elections and deadlines and isolation and bullshit just melt away. I had a pandemic's worth of hand sanitizer. Now others do, too. For one shining, Toasted Coconut-smelling moment, all was well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4764175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XR-0BK1-JBSN-31KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Peak: Simon Fraser</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 26, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0006K7J</classCode><className>BATH &amp; BODY WORKS LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS446120 COSMETICS, BEAUTY SUPPLIES &amp; PERFUME STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC2844 PERFUMES, COSMETICS, &amp; OTHER TOILET PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Van Couver</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000515</classCode><className>DISTANCE LEARNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D7G9</classCode><className>MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CM6B</classCode><className>HAND SANITIZERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D7G9</classCode><className>MIDDLE &amp; JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000987</classCode><className>FRUIT &amp; JUICE DRINKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Sears</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Maryland's fiscal outlook, once considered dire at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, continues to improve, according to one key revenue forecast.<br/>The latest projections issued Friday by the state Board of Revenue Estimates show a revenue picture for the current and coming budget years that reflects improvement. The forecast, which will be used as the basis for the coming fiscal 2022 budget, suggests Maryland will avoid some previousworst-cases scenarios of multibillion-dollar losses that kept state fiscal leaders up at night.</p><p><br/>The result is that the state now faces about a billion dollars of less revenue over the current and coming fiscal year compared to pre-pandemic estimates.<br/>\"We are now talking about a billion dollars,\" said state Budget Secretary David Brinkley, speaking of the two year projection. \"We're happy to have that challenge ahead of us. We're confident we can overcome that.\"<br/>Maryland is now projected to collect nearly $18.8 billion in the current fiscal year, an increase of more than $68 million over estimates released in September. Revenues for the coming fiscal 2022 budget are projected to reach more than $19.8 billion, an increase of $142.6 million over a September forecast.<br/>The current projections, which will not be updated again until March, are not softened by an assumption of a second federal stimulus plan. They also do not take into account the potential strain the winter surge of coronavirus could have as the state reports record increases in hospitalizations and patients and daily deaths not seen since the spring.<br/>\"Everybody says the virus is spreading like an out-of-control forest fire,\" said Comptroller Peter Franchot. \"So, it's going to be rough, not just economically. It's going to be rough from a health and safety perspective. And obviously lives and livelihoods of people that we know are going to be threatened. The irony is the vaccine is just around the corner  the silver bullet, the magic, the kind of fairy dust that's going to make everything go away.\"<br/>Gov. Larry Hogan has so far avoided imposing the kinds of tough restrictions that locked much of the state down and darkened storefronts for weeks.<br/>But some jurisdictions, including Baltimore city, Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties, have announced orders closing bars and restaurants and capping the number of customers in retail establishments at 25% of capacity.<br/>Those moves, or wider statewide restrictions, could further exacerbate what Andrew Schaufele, director of the Board of Revenue Estimates, described as a bifurcated economy where low-income workers in the food services, hospitality and hotel industries continue to lose wages while other workers' financial pictures are relatively unscathed.<br/>Franchot renewed his call for a state stimulus package to help keep those businesses afloat and pay workers.<br/>Since May, the state has seen steady improvement of its fiscal outlook driven in part by a federal stimulus package; a shift in spending from services, which are not taxed, to retail purchases, including durable goods; and an economy in which many workers could perform their jobs at home.<br/>In May, fiscal analysts were concerned about a $2.1 billion hit to state revenues. That lessened in September but an alternate forecast still warned of the potential for revenue to decrease by $1.7 billion<br/>The latest more optimistic projection is welcome but does not eliminate significant financial impacts on the state.<br/>The December revenue projection for the current year is still expected to be nearly $609 million lower than the official March estimate. The projection for fiscal 2022 budget is more than $312 million lower than an initial forecast three months ago.<br/>\"We have significant challenges ahead of us but we do have resources,\" said Brinkley.<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2020 BridgeTower Media.

There is a scene in that 1968 film where Ben (Dustin Hoffman) is getting advice about his future from Mr. McGuire. Mr. McGuire takes Ben aside and says, in a conspiratorial tone, 'I just want to say one word to you\u2014PLASTICS[1].' It's a great scene made tragic by the fact that it was prescient (plastic generation in the United States went from 2.9 million tons[2] in 1970 to over 35.7 million tons in 2018). </p><p><br/><br/>If the scene were shot today, Mr. McGuire would say: 'I just want to say one word to you\u2014BIOCHAR.' <br/><br/>Biomass-derived charcoal, or 'biochar,'[3] is charcoal that is made when biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen - a process called pyrolysis. Another way of saying it is that biochar is produced when wood chips, manure, sludges, compost and green waste[4] are burned under controlled conditions. The big difference between charcoal (like what is produced in a forest fire) and biochar, is that almost all of the CO2 of the biomass gets bound up in the biochar. Thus, biochar effectively sequesters carbon[5] in the biomass (as long as the biochar is not burned). A significant side benefit, however, is that it is a soil amendment that produces healthier soil, bigger yields, lower acidity and better water retention[6]. The resulting charcoal can cut greenhouse emissions from waste and boost soil fertility[7]. It has the added benefit of reducing the need for chemical and manure fertilizers as well as absorbing heavy metals and agricultural chemicals[8]. It is easily applied to farmland and can endure in the soil for thousands of years[9]. <br/><br/>I know what you're saying - 'Chuck, where can I get me some of this miracle product?' Well, of course, there's the rub. Like so many ideas that are good for the environment, cost is the killer. Although the technology to create biochar is not new, it isn't cheap. There are experimental examples that have been operational for several years and the fine tuning continues. But there is reason for optimism. <br/><br/>Why? Allow me to digress for a moment. Municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to be a significant problem, particularly in the United States, and disposal costs real money. We produce waste at the rate of 4.9 pounds of trash per person, per day - higher per capita than any other country. Of that amount[10], about half is landfilled, one-third is recycled and the remainder is burned for energy recovery. In the United States, the waste stream[11] consists of: food residue - 15%; wood waste - 6%; paper - 27% yard trimmings - 14%; rubber, leather, textiles - 9% plastics - 13%, metals - 9%; glass - 4%; and other - 3%. That means just about 70% of the MSW stream could be used to produce biochar. <br/><br/>So what happens when the two are combined? Specifically, what if we can reduce the volume of MSW and provide a source for the biochar ingredients at the same time? Imagine you want to make a widget. What if the cost of the raw materials to make the widget was zero? Better yet, what if people would actually pay you to take the raw materials you need from them and even deliver the materials to you free of charge? This could work with biochar. In its simplest form, a city might pay a biochar company a dollar amount per ton of municipal waste delivered to the company rather than the city paying a tipping fee at a landfill. This almost eliminates the waste stream to the landfill (a small percentage of the pyrolysis process ends up at the landfill) and provides the company with its raw materials at a negative cost. Indeed, under the right circumstance, cities could 'mine' their Mount Trashmores and send the materials to the company for processing into biochar. The biochar would then be sold to farmers as a soil amendment that would not only improve yields, but would sequester the carbon in, potentially, millions of acres of farmland. <br/><br/>Obviously this isn't meant to be a deep dive into biochar. Rather, think of it as Mr. McGuire whispering in your ear. Any product that sequesters carbon, replaces fertilizer, improves soils and reduces landfill usage is worth a hard look. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxihhBzCjk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSxihhBzCjk</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials\">https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://scitechdaily.com/the-waste-product-that-could-help-mitigate-climate-change-locking-carbon-in-the-soil-for-hundreds-to-thousands-of-years\">https://scitechdaily.com/the-waste-product-that-could-help-mitigate-climate-change-locking-carbon-in-the-soil-for-hundreds-to-thousands-of-years</url>/ [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/stpaul/swmr/people/kurt-spokas/biochar\">https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/stpaul/swmr/people/kurt-spokas/biochar</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://warmheartworldwide.org/biochar\">https://warmheartworldwide.org/biochar</url>/ [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/stpaul/swmr/people/kurt-spokas/biochar\">https://www.ars.usda.gov/midwest-area/stpaul/swmr/people/kurt-spokas/biochar</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.toaks.org/Home/Components/News/News/10392/3338?backlist=%2Fdepartments%2Fpublic-works%2Fsustainability\">https://www.toaks.org/Home/Components/News/News/10392/3338?backlist=%2Fdepartments%2Fpublic-works%2Fsustainability</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials\">https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451904917300690\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451904917300690</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Tonight, protesters are on the streets of France this hour, after the government used special powers to push through controversial pension reforms. Their new video shows that mid-air confrontation between a Russian jet and a U.S. drone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Poland says it will be the first NATO country to send Ukraine desperately-needed jets. A live report from Ukraine just ahead. Well, we begin with major developments in France over President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform bill. The government has pushed the bill through without a vote from the lower house of parliament by invoking special constitutional powers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here, you see some opposition lawmakers booing as Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne made the announcement. Opposition parties say, they will request a vote of no confidence in the government. CNN Jim Bittermann joins me now live from Paris with more on what has become a pivotal day in France. And Jim, in forcing this bill through, it might seem like the easiest option for President Macron, but it's also extremely risky.</p><p>And we have been seeing in the past few hours, protesters already amassing, once again, on the streets of Paris. So Jim, what's going to be the fallout here?</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's exactly what the risk is, Christina, that, there will be more and more protests, and it has a tendency that this is rarely used as an article called 49.3, it's basically passing legislation by decree, and it's rarely used, but when it is used, it has the tendency to enrage the opposition, and it certainly did today, this afternoon, when Elisabeth Borne went before the parliament and said that the members of the parliament were, in fact, not going to be able to vote on the legislations that they were going to pass it by decree. And here's a little bit of how she tried to justify that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELISABETH BORNE, PRIME MINISTER, FRANCE (through translator): We cannot bet on the future of our pensions. This reform is necessary. It's also because I am attached to our social model, and because I believe in parliamentary democracy. It is your reform on parliament task. Fruit of a compromise between the two assemblies, the time ready to engage my responsibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BITTERMANN: And in fact, you can kind of see what the reaction was there inside the National Assembly chamber. And outside, a crowd had gathered to sort of be on hand for this vote that didn't take place, and they immediately started protesting outside. And that's the kind of thing that we have seen tonight, and it continues at this hour.</p><p>A lot of people on the streets, the police just used water cannon just a few minutes ago in the Place de la Concorde la Hado Paris, trying to get the demonstrators to disperse. And as was expected and predicted by the union chiefs themselves, the joint union committee meeting this evening, they are going to continue their strikes and demonstrations in the days that come.</p><p>They have planned a big demonstration for March 23rd, that's on Thursday this week, Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: And Jim, opposition lawmakers have now got 24 hours to file a no confidence vote. Some have said they're already going to go ahead and do that. How likely is it that a motion like that will succeed?</p><p>BITTERMANN: Well, I think it's definitely likely it's going to be filed. We've already heard from a couple of the party leaders that it has to be passed, though, in parliament. And one of the things it does is that it means that if, in fact, it is voted in, that the government is dissolved, and they will have to have elections.</p><p>Now, a lot of these members of parliament were only just elected last June, in June of 2022. So, as a matter of fact, they are not really -- they don't really have an appetite for running for re-election again. But if -- you know, they feel strongly enough about this motion and against the retirement reforms, it could well happen.</p><p>[15:05:00]</p><p>So, it's a difficult one to say, just as today's events were difficult to predict, I think we're in a period now of time when things are going to be unpredictable for a while in France.</p><p>MACFARLANE: And Jim --</p><p>BITTERMANN: Christiane?</p><p>MACFARLANE: Just remind our viewers why President Macron, why this government is so pledged to this pension reform. Because we know this was, of course, a part of his, you know -- this was announced as part of his campaign trail. But why is Macron so unwilling to budge on this issue?</p><p>BITTERMANN: Well, I think it's been the kind of issue that governments all over Europe have been toying with and trying to get through their parliaments for years now. Basically, the retirement system is in a huge deficit and runs in a higher deficit each year, the debt is growing. And when you look at the life expectancy in France, which is now 82 years old, if you're saying that a person retires at 62, it means that the person will be living off a government-sponsored pension plan for 20 years.</p><p>And that money has to come from somewhere. It's been coming from debt. And as a consequence, I think that now, the government is -- Mr. Macron is drawing a line and saying, look, we've got to reform this pension plan. Christina?</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, and he's certainly staken a lot on it, risking perhaps his political legacy. Jim Bittermann there live from Paris, thank you very much --</p><p>BITTERMANN: Yes --</p><p>MACFARLANE: Tonight, Jim. Now, just hours ago, NHS unions reached a pay deal with the U.K. government, a major breakthrough bringing the long- running dispute closer to an end. The deal includes a 5 percent pay increase, and one of bonus payments for key workers. Both sides said they have reached, quote, \"a fair and reasonable settlement\".</p><p>This comes after months of dispute over pay. And as for what happens next, well, union workers will now vote on a decision and further strikes will be suspended until they do. Now, democracy or death? That's one of the chants heard on the streets of Israel, as protesters once again are demanding the government scrap plans to dramatically weaken judicial oversight of its own actions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(DRUMMING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: These are new pictures from Tel Aviv tonight, just into CNN. Demonstrators have been blocking roads there and across Israel today, but despite weeks of scenes like this and new warning from Israel's president about possible civil war, the government so far isn't budging. CNN's Hadas Gold takes us into the crowds of Jerusalem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We are with some dozens of protesters across Israel, another massive day of disruption. Israelis taking to the streets in the tens of thousands, protesting against this massive judicial overhaul planned by Benjamin Netanyahu's government. We are here actually at a student protest, this is the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and many of these students -- what they see is the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy if this overhaul goes through.</p><p>At its core, this overhaul would not only allow the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court's decisions, it would also drastically change how judges are appointed in Israel. But supporters of the reform say that it's sorely needed, that it's been lacking for a long time, that will help re- balance the branches of the Israeli government.</p><p>Last night, the Israeli President Isaac Herzog put out his own compromise proposal, warning that if a proposal -- if a compromise is not reached, then the country could be on a brink of a civil war.</p><p>ISAAC HERZOG, PRESIDENT, ISRAEL (through translator): I'm going to use a phrase I haven't used before. An expression that there is no Israeli who is not horrified when he hears it. Whoever thinks that the real civil war of human lives is a limit that we will not reach, has no idea. Precisely now, in the 75th year of the state of Israel, that this is within touching distance.</p><p>GOLD: But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flatly rejecting the compromise proposal, saying it doesn't do enough, and he says it would only perpetuate what he believes is the current problem with the judiciary. Now the question will be, what will Benjamin Netanyahu's government do next? Will they push forward with their very speedy unilateral action, trying to get it done within the next few weeks, potentially even few days?</p><p>Or will they possibly potentially soften their legislation just a little bit, to help tamper down these very fervent emotions that we're seeing here on the streets of Israel? Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Our thanks to Hadas for that. Well, a prominent U.S. Senator says America must send a message to Israel, accusing the Netanyahu government of an assault on the two-state solution. Chris Murphy spoke earlier to CNN. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): There are very few people who know the Israeli mood better than President Herzog, and I was deeply disturbed to see his comments yesterday. I think he speaks to how the Netanyahu government is really fraying the bonds that have connected Israelis together.</p><p>[15:10:00]</p><p>And I worry that we are at a moment in which we are watching a future Palestinian state be obliterated by the pace of settlements by the legalization of outposts. And I think the United States needs to draw a harder line with this government. If we're going to continue to be in the business of supporting the Israeli government, they have to be in the continued business of a future Palestinian state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, Palestinian Health Ministry says, a day time Israeli military operation in Jenin has killed at least four Palestinians including a teenager.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(GUNFIRE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Palestinian news agency, \"Wafa\" calls it a surprise raid by undercover Israeli forces. The Israeli army says two of those killed where militants suspected of terrorist activities, and another had tried to attack them with an iron rod. Palestinians say, 23 people were wounded, five critically. Now, the Pentagon has released dramatic video of the confrontation between Russian jets and a U.S. drone high in the skies over the Black Sea.</p><p>You can see here a Russian fighter jet approaching the drone from behind, and then unleashing a wave of fuel against it. Then you can see the jet approach a second time, and according to the Pentagon, clipped the drone's propeller briefly, knocking out the camera you can see just there. And when the video resumes, the damage of the propeller is clear to see.</p><p>Moscow says its jet never collided with the drone, but the apparent contact forced the drone out of the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LLOYD AUSTIN, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, UNITED STATES: This hazardous episode is a part -- is part of a pattern of aggressive, risky and unsafe actions by Russian pilots in international airspace. And the United States will continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Well, CNN's Oren Liebermann has been taking a close look at the video and joins us now from the Pentagon. Oren, I guess in releasing this video, the U.S. are moving to provide evidence of their account of what happened after repeated denials from Russia. Just walk us through what we're seeing in these clips, and how rare this access is.</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: It's incredibly rare to get drone video like this. It simply doesn't happen all that often that the Pentagon released this video from a spy drone operating over the Black Sea, so close to a war zone. So, let's talk about the two different parts of this video. There are two separate passes from Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jets against an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</p><p>In the first one, you see as the jet approaches, starts to jump jet -- dump jet fuel, and then passes by the drone itself. You also then see back, you see the fuel vapor essentially hanging in the air and the propeller itself functioning, that is, spinning. In the second part of the video, you see another pass. Again, the same dumping of jet fuel, and then, this is the crucial moment.</p><p>When the video itself freezes or pixelates a little bit, that's a result of the collision here, and then you see the impact of the collision damaging the propeller. It is that damage to the propeller that forced the U.S. drone operators to bring the drone down some 70 miles southwest of the Crimean Peninsula in international waters. During that process, CNN has learned that the drone operators wiped the sensitive software, essentially the sensitive memory and capabilities off of the drone itself before it crashed into the water.</p><p>CNN has also learned that the Russians reached the crash site, U.S. made it clear that it wouldn't be able to recover it itself in all likelihood because there are no Navy ships in the Black Sea. But there certainly are Russian ships, and they made clear that they would try to make an effort to recover it. Even if they can't recover any sort of sensitive data, information or Intel, it is still a propaganda victory for Russia, if they're able to pick up some of those pieces off the water.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, and Oren, the U.S. have said that they were successful in managing to remotely wipe the drone before it was downed. Does the fact that we have this video actually support that claim? Because obviously, this was able to be recovered.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: I don't think the presence or existence of the video tells us anything about the decision to wipe the memory of it, because that -- the video itself is of the moment of the collision. And keep in mind, this encounter lasted quite some time, right? The Pentagon says it was 30 to 40 minutes that these two Russian fighter jets were essentially harassing the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone.</p><p>The decision to wipe the memory would have come after this. How do we know that? It's a very difficult thing to be able to prove. That's from the Pentagon here and from officials here that, that was the measure taken to make sure there was no sensitive information falling to the Russians. We have heard General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as well as John Kirby, from the National Security Council, say the U.S. did take steps in mitigating measures to make sure that there was nothing sensitive that fell into Russian or other hands.</p><p>MACAFARLANE: All right, our Liebermann, we appreciate you breaking that down for us, thank you.</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>Now, Poland will become the first NATO country to send jets to Ukraine, fulfilling Kyiv's increasingly urgent request for fighter planes. Speaking earlier, the Polish President Andrzej Duda said his country will hand over four MiG-29 jets in the coming days. Also has taken a lead among NATO allies in supplying Ukraine with heavy weaponry to counter Russian attacks.</p><p>Their support comes as fierce fighting continues on the battlefield especially around Bakhmut. Both Russia and Ukraine saying the situation there is quote, \"complicated\". So let's bring in senior international correspondent David McKenzie for us live from Kyiv tonight. David, Ukraine as we know, have been calling for fighter jets for months.</p><p>How significant is it that Poland are the first NATO ally to offer them, and do we know anything about how soon they can be operational?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they say they would come within days, and that these MiG 29s, according to the Polish President, Christina, have been refurbished and are ready for use. So one can assume that it could be imminently -- no, I don't think necessarily, these four MiG jets which were holdovers from the former east Germany and then sourced by Poland, will necessarily turn the tide of this war.</p><p>But I think it's important in two ways. It does break a psychological barrier of some kind, I would say, of NATO country supplying fighter jets, and clearly, an attack asset to Ukrainians, something Zelenskyy has asked for, for some time as you say. And also, that they will open the door, potentially again, for other countries to follow suit.</p><p>The Ukrainian president has repeatedly asked for this kind of assets to get in the hands of their pilots, and so, yes, it's definitely very significant. Christina.</p><p>MACFARLANE: And David, how likely are we to see other NATO allies follow suit. Because we've already heard repeatedly from the U.S. for instance, their stance from their stead, it will be impractical to send jets because, you know, at the very least, require an awful lot of training.</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, we've had that reasoning, given for other types of military assets including tanks and more complex systems like the HIMARS systems. And yet, the Ukrainian military has successfully operated those systems. So, yes, there is a different level of sophistication, I would say, with some of the more sophisticated NATO level fighter jets and training required for that.</p><p>There's some indication that Ukrainian pilots are already getting some kind of testing and training on those systems. In the short term, there may be more Soviet-era airplanes that could come to Ukraine. So it's important from the Ukrainian perspective. I think what is perhaps more pressing are the nuts and bolts need of the groups on the ground in the eastern front for artillery pieces and artillery shells.</p><p>Just today, the chancellor of Germany say they need to accelerate the supply of Ukraine's military on the ground, particularly in the east for the very intense shelling that is ongoing there, and the fact that at least for more than a month now, we're hearing that the -- if not running very low, certainly running short of this kind of ammunition, which actually gets the job done on the ground during this conflict. Christina?</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, important to remember that, that intense fighting in Bakhmut is still ongoing. David McKenzie there live from Kyiv, thanks very much, David. All right, still to come tonight, embattled banking giant Credit Suisse gets a lifeline to the tune of $54 billion. How that and other news impacted the markets today.</p><p>And later, a handshake 12 years in the making. We'll tell you about a fence-mending summit in Tokyo.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:20:00]</p><p>MACFARLANE: Shares of European banking giant Credit Suisse closed 19 percent higher Thursday after news that the Swiss National Bank would give it a $54 billion lifeline. This after shares plunged nearly 25 percent a day earlier, putting global markets on edge. Meantime, the European Central Bank has raised interest rates by half point, and U.S. federal regulators are working to prevent more fallout from the collapse of two banks last week.</p><p>Well, we've got a team coverage of the many developments this hour impacting global markets. Clare Sebastian is standing by in London. But first, let's go to Matt Egan in New York. And Matt, we heard from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen just this morning saying that the U.S. banking system remains sound. And yet, today, we are seeing another big sell-off of a U.S. regional bank, First Republic. So just walk us through what's happening here.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christina, this is really all about confidence. I mean, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last week really shook confidence in the banking system, both among investors and the public at large. Now, we are seeing an effort from U.S. officials and from the industry itself to try to restore confidence.</p><p>Now, what's interesting is regional banks, all four on the screen, they all opened the day sharply lower. First Republic was down 36 percent, but now it is completely turned around, up 7 percent on the day. And that's because there is an industry-led rescue effort underway. A source familiar with them confirms to CNN that big banks are in talks to provide a lifeline to First Republic, which is a San Francisco-based regional bank.</p><p>Now, the big banks include a consortium that includes JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Truist. And the source familiar with the matter says that this would be structured as deposits, that the big banks would be transferring deposits to the smaller banks in an effort to try to give it some more financial firepower here to meet customer withdrawals.</p><p>And also to try to instill some confidence in the banking system. And we're also hearing that U.S. officials are welcoming this apparent rescue. U.S. officials telling CNN that this rescue that happens would be a welcome sign of confidence in the banking system, and it would compliment some of the steps that regulators have already taken.</p><p>Now, we don't have anything confirmed yet, First Republic, a number of the big banks are commenting, but a deal could be announced any hour.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, and if it is, I mean, that's going to be a significant development. I want to come back to you in just a second on the wider implications that it would have for the market. But Clare, first, speaking of confidence, you know, both sides of the pond today. We saw a move of half a percent by the ECB, which have been in doubt, but it's clear that the central bank has decided that, you know, inflation poses a bigger risk to European -- to Europe's economy.</p><p>So, what is going to be the effect of that rate rise? Because we know that, you know, there was some concern around that, that, that would add further stress to the markets.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN REPORTER: Yes, I think it's too soon to tell. Certainly, as you say, the ECB made it very clear that they just cannot stand by and allow inflation to stay at 8.5 percent in the euro zone compared to the U.S., which is of course, at 6 percent, has shown more signs of improvement. On what it's going to have, what kind of impact it's going to have? We're not talking so much in Europe about the stress on bank's balance sheets that you saw in the U.S.</p><p>[15:25:00]</p><p>European banks don't have as much long-term debt that we'll see it on paper value go down as interest rates go up. But they are monitoring to see if the overall issue with confidence as you say is going to cause banks to sort of pull back on lending. The Guard(ph) was saying that she was looking for things like tightening restrictions on lending terms and conditions, things like that.</p><p>That is something that closely monitoring. The speculation now is yes, they've done this half percentage point rate rise today, but they did not telegraph what's coming next, as they have been doing recently. So could they pause after this? That's the question.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Let's talk about Credit Suisse in a moment. We know at the very least that Credit Suisse is a very different type of bank --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes --</p><p>MACFARLANE: Of course, to SVB. And Matt, as I understand it, First Republic is at the very least similar to SVB. In that, it is a midsize bank, right? So, are we seeing the beginning here of a possible contagion within U.S. regional banks. What's the concern around that right now?</p><p>EGAN: Right, well, investors are on high alert for the next shoe to drop. And the logical thing to do is to look at what banks have a similar profile as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature are the ones that already collapsed. And so, in that sense, you know, First Republic Bank is similar because it has a large chunk of its deposit base is uninsured, meaning more than $250,000.</p><p>It caters to wealthy customers. And so, that is one of the reasons why First Republic shares had been under so much pressure over the last week or so. Now, regulators are doing everything they can to try to prevent contagion, right? I mean, that's why they come out with all of these statements, that's why they rescued the uninsured depositors at Signature and Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>And that's why the Fed launched this lending program designed to give banks some liquidity. Banks that are dealing with deposit requests, and banks that also, as Clare was alluding to, are sitting on a lot of long-term debt that has lost value as interest rates have gone up. So they're doing everything they can to prevent contagion, and now we are seeing the industry itself apparently working hard to also prevent contagion and to try to boost confidence.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, and it's going to be really interesting to see what the Federal Reserve do next week, obviously following this ECB announcement today. Nerves still very much running high though, I mean, it's the message we're receiving today, and we're going to have to leave it there. But both, thank you, Matt, thank you, Clare, both very much.</p><p>Now, Japan and South Korea are pledging to turn the page on years of hostility and open a new chapter in relations. For the first time in 12 years, a South Korean president has attended a summit in Tokyo. CNN's Marc Stewart has more on what's been called an important milestone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The visit here in Tokyo between Japan's Prime Minister and South Korea's President appears to be a new era in diplomatic relations. These two nations have had a difficult past, and now they're trying to move forward amid some sheer(ph) stress in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says Tokyo and Seoul have agreed to resume shuttle diplomacy to open a new chapter in relations in a joint statement with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.</p><p>President Yoon saying, quote, \"we agree today that the people of the two countries have suffered direct or indirect damage, due to the pros in bilateral relations, and agree to restore and develop Korea-Japan relations as soon as possible. President Yoon also agreed to completely normalize its military Intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan.</p><p>Relations between the two nations have been difficult in recent years, soured over several issues, including a wartime labor dispute that had emotional, economic and political implications. No start date has been set to resume shuttle diplomacy, but this is happening in the face of North Korean nuclear and missile threats.</p><p>In addition, we're already seeing the thaw before this meeting, Japan's trade ministry said it would lift export controls on three South Korean products including one critical for the production of semiconductors. Seoul entered, agreed to lift its complaints with the World Trade Organization. Both leaders hope exchanges between the two countries will expand to politics, economics and culture. Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: All right, still to come tonight, a look at how students around the globe are shedding light on a very important topic. Plus, the Biden administration has given an apparent ultimatum to the Chinese company behind TikTok. We'll have the latest, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Welcome back.</p><p>The U.K. has now banned TikTok from official government devices. They're concerned the Chinese might share users sensitive data with the Beijing government. It does not impact personal devices.</p><p>The U.S. and E.U. have similar policies but Joe Biden is demanding their owners spin off their shares, threatening to ban the social media app from the U.S. CNN technology reporter Brian Fung joins me now live.</p><p>The pressure on TikTok has been building or ratcheting up just so months now. I think this is the first time the U.S. government has been talking about a national ban.</p><p>How real is that risk, that sensitive data could end up in the hands of Chinese?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a potentially real risk here. We're talking about a rare look inside the negotiations, these long running negotiations between TikTok and the United States about whether or not they will be able to continue operating in the U.S.</p><p>Security concerns that you raised and identified earlier. What's interesting about this is that it appears to be a pivot or turning point for these negotiations, which previously the Biden administration had been sitting on a lot of these talks.</p><p>And with that resolution. It had been coming out under heavy criticism for some members of Congress for not acting swiftly enough on the TikTok issue. So the Biden administration pushing for TikTok to spin off its app from the Chinese owners under the threat of a U.S. ban.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers have been proposing expanding the president's authority to issue a nationwide TikTok ban on personal devices.</p><p>The White House has also thrown its support behind that initiative but TikTok is saying that a divestiture is not in the best interest of the United States or the company. It is saying that, instead, the voluntary measures that it has put in place on a technical level and on a bureaucratic level --</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>FUNG: -- to prevent U.S. user data from falling into the hands of the Chinese government is the best path forward. Of course, many of TikTok's critics say that is not nearly enough.</p><p>MACFARLANE: What is the likelihood the U.S. government can ban the app?</p><p>They're likely to come up on challenges with First Amendment grounds.</p><p>FUNG: There've been criticisms of some existing U.S. proposals to ban TikTok nationally, saying that it could infringe on Americans' First Amendment rights to post on social media, to speak on line and to exercise their free speech rights that way.</p><p>It is unclear whether or not that argument could fly in courts, it is also unclear whether the Biden administration could sustain a ban, based on its standing legal authority.</p><p>In the past, when president Trump tried to ban TikTok, there were legal challenges then as well that led to some of the long running negotiations that we've been seeing unfold today.</p><p>MACFARLANE: No doubt, TikTok fanatics are watching on nervously. Thank you for your insight.</p><p>A new type of drone has appeared in the skies over Ukraine, made in China but was never meant to be used for military purposes. Both sides claim the other side is using them on the battlefield. More from Ivan Watson in this exclusive report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukrainian military footage of a drone strike at a Russian rocket launcher. The bloody war between Russia and Ukraine is being fought on the ground and in the sky using drones and unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, some of which were never intended for military use.</p><p>This is one of the weapons in this war, a drone that could fly far behind the front lines carrying a powerful bomb rigged to hurl deadly pieces of shrapnel like this.</p><p>Ukraine's territorial defense gave CNN an exclusive look at what's left of a weaponized UAV originally manufactured in China.</p><p>Ukrainian state security service says an agent reported the launch of the drone from Russian occupied territory and troops shot it down at 2:00 am on Saturday.</p><p>This is remarkable. The officer is explaining that his man shut this drone down using rifles. Rifles.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Rifles yes.</p><p>WATSON: So the drone was flying low?</p><p>\"The drone was flying low and visible to the naked eye,\" he tells me.</p><p>This is where the bomb landed. The explosive device on the drone.</p><p>Troops rigged the unexploded 20 kilogram bomb with explosives and then sprinted for cover.</p><p>[01:39:44]</p><p>WATSON: Officers identified the drone as a Mugen 5 which the manufacturer Mugen Limited also confirmed to CNN. The company is based in Xiamen (ph), China, designing UAV air frames for activities like forest fire prevention and agriculture.</p><p>Mugen drones have been available for sale on Chinese online marketplaces like Alibaba and Taobao for about up to $15,000 prompting some tech bloggers to give it the nickname the Alibaba drone. Mugen 5 condemns any use of its drones on the battlefield, adding that the company ceased to accept orders from both Russia and Ukraine since the start of the war.</p><p>But in January, Russian forces displayed these images of what is also a Mugen 5. The Russian military claims it was a Ukrainian UAV that it shot down.</p><p>Drone expert Chris Lincoln Jones calls these militarized UAVs dumb bombs.</p><p>CHRIS LINCOLN JONES, DRONE EXPERT: This particular drone we've been looking at would be much more effective if it had a decent camera on it.</p><p>WATSON: The former British Army officer, who specialized in drone warfare says he expected more from a military superpower like Russia.</p><p>JONES: This seems to be a very crude, unsophisticated, not very technologically advanced way of conducting operations.</p><p>WATSON: Ivan Watson, CNN, in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Still to come tonight, we are checking in on young people on two continents to see how they are celebrating My Freedom Day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Freedom is being able to choose whatever we want to study at school, especially as a girl.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Freedom is the ability to make decisions about my own likelihood and well-being.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>MACFARLANE: We are celebrating with young people around the world a student-led day of action to combat modern-day slavery. These girls outside London came up with an interpretive dance to show what freedom means to them.</p><p>We're reporting from schools across the globe. Stefano Pozzebon is just outside Bogota, Colombia, at the San Rafael rehab center.</p><p>Stefano, tell us what you are seeing today, what you've been hearing and why you are there?</p><p>STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Christina, here we are. We're in a rehabilitation center where some of these patients are here to overcome issues, like substance abuse, alcoholism, drug abuse in particular and some minor mental disorders.</p><p>But we are here to hear about experiences from people who did overcome modern slavery. It's all about being in shared experiences.</p><p>So in the morning, we heard the people here, the patients, sharing their experiences. You just caught us in the middle of a conversation with a couple of people that wear (INAUDIBLE) structure like these and in institutions like these and who are here to share their experiences in overcoming modern slavery.</p><p>One, Jesus here, for example, spoke with us at CNN. He said overcoming slavery, becoming free, is all about work as a team. As a final note, we shared here on these walls what freedom means for most of these people who are struggling and are in the middle of a very tough time in their lives.</p><p>They've written letters about the concept of freedom, slavery; some of them have made drawings. These letters have been put here, placed on this wall under the hashtag and will stay here for the upcoming days -- this is their common room where they live 24/7 -- to raise awareness.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>POZZEBON: So everybody here can know the sign about modern slavery, can recognize the situation from whatever background they come from. We've had people who struggled with cocaine, with marijuana abuse, alcoholism, many other abuses.</p><p>They are here to get back on their feet, get better in their life and also to be aware that this phenomenon of modern slavery is still part of our society.</p><p>MACFARLANE: Yes, these are important discussions to be having. The more we talk, the more we can recognize the signs of modern-day slavery. I'll let you get back to the discussion that you've been having behind you. Stefano Pozzebon, thank you very much.</p><p>Lynda Kinkade spent the day at Atlanta International School in Georgia, where the students told her what freedom means to them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: I'm here at the Atlanta International School, where every student is learning about modern slavery. This is a fifth grade class in a sweatshop simulation. According to UNICEF, 116 million kids around the world, aged 5 to 17, work in some sort of forced labor.</p><p>These classes are run by sixth graders.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: In this situation we're trying to make them feel a little angry, sad, because they're working for us basically. We are shouting, we're like, make it better, work harder, do it faster.</p><p>And I remember some kids from the previous class told us, oh, you didn't give us enough time. We cannot do this.</p><p>KINKADE: How did you feel being screamed at during that session?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I felt like it got really anxious, it made wanted to go faster.</p><p>KINKADE: How do you feel?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It gave me a lot of anxiety. The only thing I wanted to do was cut everything up because it just didn't feel right.</p><p>KINKADE: What was the sweatshop experience like for you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My heart ran away with my brain and my hands were just doing things and I didn't know what I was doing. My hands are now sweating.</p><p>KINKADE: They're not one but two anti trafficking groups at the school. They're doing presentations and also action stations, like this petition run by the 10th grade.</p><p>Tell us your name and about these three petitions.</p><p>KAIXUAN GUO, 10TH GRADER: My name is Kaixuan Guo and I am a 10th grader at Atlanta International School. For the first petition, we have ending child labor in the cocoa industry. For the second one, we have migration policies for preventing human trafficking.</p><p>For the third one, we have helping young athletes at risk of human trafficking.</p><p>KINKADE: Plenty of students signing these and sharing them on social media. My favorite, the chocolate station.</p><p>What does this mean to have fair trade chocolate?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fair trade chocolate means that there is minimal child labor and human trafficking going around in your company.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This year we want to have a special focus on the sports industry, talking about what human trafficking and how it relates to the sports industry.</p><p>On Tuesday, we had a charity soccer game, where we had an Man United player to come out and speak about the issue. After each presentation, we actually have the students writing on the soccer ball and it will go to child trafficking survivors.</p><p>KINKADE: Incredible work here.</p><p>Earlier today, we saw kindergarten students play hula hoop games to learn about the rights of a child so it's never too early to learn about My Freedom Day and how you can make a difference.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MACFARLANE: It's so great to see the different ways that children have been engaging on this issue.

My family was struggling and we needed an assist. Little did I know that (INAUDIBLE) should be the end but the beginning of a mistake I would not be able to amend.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Freedom to me is more having a right to make your own choices and to have your voice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Speaking foreign language).</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: They created a boulder with the message, what does freedom mean to you?</p><p>And responses are all over the rock, including self determination and power over your life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We plan to overpower (ph) slave owners can take advantage of more vulnerable groups and illegally smuggle or transport them away to remote countries by tricking them or promising them something too good to be true.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Speaking foreign language).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right behind me, under this gigantic and beautiful (INAUDIBLE) campus, you can see about a dozen students from high school, talking about modern day slavery, child trafficking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I believe the modern day slavery and human trafficking starts with people, very vulnerable nature, being forced to take very risky opportunities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE) when I am on the pitch (ph) with all my family.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel free when I swim.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we need to educate the younger generations on the signs of human trafficking.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think our generation can take hold and actually make a positive decision about what we do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We should work together to stop modern slavery.</p><p>Do we agree?</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACFARLANE: Join CNN as we observe My Freedom Day, tell us what it means to you and share your message on social media using #MyFreedomDay.

And lastly, looking forward in terms of 2023, what to expect in terms of our financial forecast.</p><p>This overview, our mission is to enable the most safe, fuel-efficient and low-cost freight capacity. And we're doing so by developing the best Level 4 self-driving technology by integrating that with hardware and with our network-based go-to-market strategy, the Autonomous Freight Network.</p><p>At a quick glance, today, we're about 1,100 employees globally. We have about 60 active trucks, doing self-driving on the road. We're delivering freight out of 3 terminals. 80% of our employees are R&amp;D-focused engineers. One of the cool things I want to talk about is our launch of our proprietary autonomous domain controllers or the central compute. In a way, this allows us to be a next-generation Mobileye.</p><p>We do have the largest homegrown patent portfolio globally for self-driving truck application. Based on third-party analysis, we can say that this portfolio is also the most innovative. And I think that creates a lot of value for TuSimple. And earlier this year, we reached 10 million miles of road miles. And it's nice because it is a testament to the safety culture as well as our productivity.</p><p>So before I get into investment highlights, I do want to say the obvious, 2022 was a difficult year for us. I think in a way, we are a victim of our own success. We tried to do too many things too fast. I would say the prior leadership lacked experience or judgment, created things that unfortunately were self-inflicted harm. And on top of that, you add the geopolitical tension and a match became a forest fire.</p><p>Over the last several months, the team really has rallied. We've stabilized the management team. There's been no turnover on that side. We improved corporate governance. We reduced cost, streamlined operations while having a clear road map in terms of how we go forward. And of course, we do still have a lot of work remaining and some unresolved items. But I'm here today because I do feel like this is a good time for a relaunch. We're ready for a relaunch. And I'm excited of what's coming.</p><p>And so let me kind of share a few highlights why I think that's the case. So in terms of what gets me excited about TuSimple and also one of the reasons why I came back is, look, fundamentally, the investment thesis for self-driving trucks haven't changed. It's still a massive market and the supply/demand dynamics haven't -- it's only gotten worse. And so the need for freight capacity continues to persist.</p><p>Second is TuSimple, our track record speaks for ourself. We are, I will say, one of the few companies that have constantly demonstrated where hit the milestones that we set out to achieve, and that's important in this industry, right? It is one that is based on credibility and, of course, that provides a good foundation for us to move forward.</p><p>Third is we have enhanced our corporate governance and some of the regulatory overhang. And so kind of pleased to make the progress there.</p><p>Number four, everyone talks about commercialization. We do believe we'll be first to commercially launch a self-driving lane. And I'll share about why we think that's the case. What's the framework. And again, given what we've proved in the past, why -- you should trust us that we can achieve these milestones.</p><p>Number five is -- this is new. Since last year, we announced a partnership with NVIDIA to co-develop a domain controller. And this is not something where we use all their existing chips and systems, but really ground up central computer. And this is a big part of capturing this wave in automotive where edge computing on the sensor level where you're having hundreds of different ECUs are all moving back -- moving towards a centralized supercomputer because they need to process a lot of data and actually is more cheaper and more efficient.</p><p>And lastly is we are one holding company. Over the last several years, we became 2 distinct businesses. There are some shared resources. But between our U.S. and China operations, we're doing different things, different technology road maps, but there's value here to be created to shareholders, given kind of what we can do with 2 distinct businesses. And I think today, we're trading below our cash value. I do believe that where we are in technology, where we are in terms of what we developed so far and the road map we have going forward, I do think there's hopefully more value we can unlock for shareholders.</p><p>So I'll quickly run through some of the highlights on each of these investment thesis. I mean it goes without saying that this is just North America freight market, 3 million Class A trucks, 80% -- or 70% of all freight moves on trucks. And the nice thing is they move, especially on long haul, across what basically 5 or 6 major interstate highways. So really a loss of density and getting a few highways automated can create a very viable, very large business. And this is different in robotaxi, right? Because you had really go from city to city, and you're covering a much denser area, if you want to provide a service at each city. The supply -- I mean, ultimately, for freight industry, it's a commoditized business. It's really just about supply and demand, right?</p><p>The supply of truck drivers continue to get smaller and smaller. The demand, because of e-commerce, because of -- we want things sooner, faster, continues to increase. And the cost of safety have continued to go up. The big thing for the freight industry is these nuclear verdicts. And that's something that I think is -- it is my understanding is not getting that much better. And so this is all the things that self-driving can, of course, help. And this is why our fundamental mission, we're not here to build a self-driving truck. We're here to automate freight lanes one lane at a time and add capacity that is safe, reliable and low cost to this ecosystem.</p><p>One of the really, I think, standout things for TuSimple is we are the only player in the self-driving truck industry to have done full self-driving runs. These are 80-mile runs from Tucson to Phoenix. I think there's been a lot of talk about difference between trucking and robotaxis. Two things to point out here. One is to commercialize, everybody has to go through this phase of being able to drive without a human driver. And the reason is because you have to prove that you're feature complete, right, the truck can drive on this operational design domain without human assistance.</p><p>And second is you had to improve the redundancy of the system. Just having -- driving on a very sort of -- where everything is perfect is one thing, but the reality is we have to basically design and build the system and test the system for when everything isn't perfect. And so that level redundancy is very important. And I would argue that one of the -- probably the biggest challenges for trucking -- actually trucking is quite harder to do full self-driving than robotaxis for one reason, and that's because you can't just stop the truck in the middle of a highway, right?</p><p>So if you're in a city, in San Francisco and it's -- there's a malfunction, a system error, worse comes to worst, you can kind of stop in the middle of the road. Now you (expletive) off the people behind you, but it's relatively safe. For a truck, you cannot stop when you're going 65 miles an hour. You have to safely pull over to the side or the shoulder. And so that alone, you can imagine the level of reliability and redundancy that's required, the fail operational. And so that's something that we have demonstrated safely. And that's the foundation for -- how we move forward from there.</p><p>In terms of corporate governance, now last year, there's -- currently still, of course, we had quite a bit of turnover and issues on this side. We built a new Board starting November that I would -- I believe is better suited to guide the company through some of the issues and strategic priorities that we have. So Mike and Tyler, both have strong regulatory experience, both worked at Treasury at one point and actually leading different departments within Treasury, including CFIUS.</p><p>Of course, we have financial experts, and we have folks that scale technology operations from where we are today to a much larger company. So as of today, we have a majority of independent Board members and we reconstituted all of the committees that's required, of course, to be NASDAQ listed.</p><p>We are progressing in terms of removing some of the regulatory -- outstanding regulatory items. So one of them is this FMCSA investigation into an accident last year. 10 million miles, we had 1 liable incident. Again, we should have zero, of course, that's the goal. But having 1 actually is much better than many relative -- I would say, many fleets out there, by most fleets out there. And we learned a lot from this incident. And the results of the incident, our investigation was there was no penalty. And I think it was actually a good working relationship with the FMCSA and we shared a lot more about it on our website.</p><p>Now this is a meaty slide, but we -- everyone talks about commercialization, commercial launch. But what does it really mean, right? How do you -- how do I prove to you that we have a path at getting there? And I think, first of all, we'd start from 2 things. One is what is that the consumer wants? And the second is what have you done in the past to show how we can, in the next year or 2, get there? And starting with what consumers want, what the shipper wants is very simple in this industry. It's level of service, so you have to be -- you have to have reliable freight capacity, right? And two, is you have to have on cost -- sorry, on-time delivery.</p><p>And second is this cost per mile. And so from those things, what that means is in very early 2022, we demonstrated driver operations, right? That was a demonstration, a validation of our technology, feature complete, the redundancy required. But that wasn't commercialization because we only were running once a week. We were running on nighttime. We had a safety case that encompasses that particular set of operational design domain. And we really didn't care too much about cost, right? There was nonscalable operations in terms of having a survey vehicle, a chase vehicle and, of course, just a pre-trip/post-trip.</p><p>And these are all now things we really factor into because the point was to demonstrate that this technology is here, and it's a matter of engineering work to get to next level. Now going from there, as the starting point, there's 3 buckets that we have to work on. One, we had to expand the safety case. So expanded safety case to cover a more larger operational design domain, and that's something we're working on today. We are actively doing third-party auditing for our entire system. And I think that's important for public acceptance.</p><p>The second is you have to increase reliability. So reliability means what the shippers care about. You can't have one run per week. It's going to be multiple runs per week, multiple runs per day, day and night, and that's something that -- there are a few things we have to check off or to -- not develop, but to continue to engineer and we're in the progress of doing those.</p><p>And lastly is cost effective. And so the way I think about it is with this truck, the truck is a tool and the truck, you can always trade off safety -- efficiency for safety. So if -- what that means is if one, first of all, make sure that we're not hitting anybody, right? So safety aside, everything else becomes cost. And there's sort of nonscalable cost items like a chase vehicle. So that's moving towards our cloud platform of monitoring multiple self-driving trucks. And then one of the other things is the number of the frequency of the truck getting to some sort of degradation mode where we have to trigger a minimum risk condition. A minimum risk condition is where the truck safely pulls over the side of the road, right? This is -- as you can do this safely, then it becomes a cost game.</p><p>I mean you can't have MRC every run you do because it probably takes a few hundred dollars to rescue the truck and obviously, it's pain in the butt, too. And so everything else is cost, and that's where a lot of the engineering work is going to today as well. So from Driver Out pilot to initial launch of commercial freight, we want to show that our vehicle is reliable enough to meet the basic demands of a customer, and there's a clear line of sight to be cost-effective on a per cost and per mile basis.</p><p>And so our timeline is we're -- sometime in 2024, we believe we can automate one freight lane. And we're automating one freight lane. One of the things we have done is proactively looked at our cost structure, reduce costs, streamline operations, and -- while still hitting the big milestones that's important for shareholders and to our business. And so one of the things we proactively done is to scale back our operations. We're starting with automating one freight lane from Tucson to Phoenix, where we did our Driver Out operations and then scaling from there.</p><p>I think it's more cost effective. Our center of operations is there. We're not recreating the entire infrastructure in Texas today, which is very expensive. And -- but it allows us to achieve the same things in terms of going to commercial launch. And one of the exciting things is as we're seeing some movement in California -- actually, if you can automate Tucson to Phoenix and if California opens up, then Port of Long Beach to Phoenix and then down Tucson becomes actually a very, very lucrative freight lane.</p><p>So I know we're probably spending a lot more time on the presentation, but one of the cool things that we haven't advertised at all, but -- except for one announcement last year, is we -- in partnership with NVIDIA, we developed our own proprietary supercomputer effectively. Think of this as a centralized compute that is ground-up development. So we license -- we spent a lot of money licensing NVIDIA's SoC. And so everything that goes on to this motherboard in terms of the SoC, other chips, the middleware, sensor support, all these things have been ground-up development.</p><p>And the domain controller, typically is called, we call, TuSimple Domain Controller, TDC, is it solves 2 problems. One problem is to actually have a self-driving truck go into production. On the market today, there isn't a computer that's auto grade like that is -- that can support actually the computational needs that we have and for many other self-driving companies. And so today, we're using big mainframes effectively, they're ruggedized, but that could scale to a certain degree, but it's not production ready. So this is.</p><p>The second is it actually opens up a lot of near-term monetization opportunities because -- this is the whole industry trend, I think folks that are kind of looking at automotive space as well is really now -- historically, a truck or a vehicle has about a few hundred ECUs, right? And if you look at sensor providers, too, LiDARs, radars, every sensor provider is trying to upsell you with their own software. They're trying to do the -- the raw data, convert that, give you a signal at the sensor level, so there's a chip at a sensor level, and trying to charge OEMs more for it.</p><p>The challenge is as you get into really advanced Level 3 -- Level 2+, Level 3 and for self-driving, full self-driving that's not enough. You have to have a central compute that can process many sensor modalities. And it's got to be a low power consumption. And ultimately, low enough cost because for pass car and for trucks, TCO is an important thing. So one of the benefits -- well, the big benefit here is that it does have a distinct competitive advantage for TuSimple building own. And you can argue that the people that's sort of more suitable to develop this piece of hardware are the ones that know how to use the software, right? Because we can actually give the right requirements on how this domain controller is designed.</p><p>So that's always been a challenge today. I mean some of the large Tier 1s are developing a domain controller, but again, where does the requirements come from, right? If you want to satisfy many, many people, then this piece of hardware looks a little bit different. It might not satisfy all the -- everyone's needs. So it's actually a very complex piece of hardware. We have about 100 people on the hardware side working on this for the last 1.5 years. We have a very good contract manufacturer based in Asia that is contract manufacturing. We are working with C samples very soon and production will be in the first half of 2024.</p><p>And I know -- I mean our core mission is Level 4. We've always stated that. That, of course, is the, call it, the holy grail, right? But we're leveraging a lot of the software development, the technology we learn on Level 4, and we announced last year that starting in China, we're looking at Level 2+ ADAS. And the nice thing about having domain controller, and we actually also make our own cameras, is we're no longer just selling software. You don't make much money selling software. It has to be an integrated solution that the OEMs actually can use.</p><p>And so we are actively working with certain OEMs on a Level 2+ solution. So think of this as really next-generation Mobileye. It's -- Mobileye today, it's a camera, radar, plus edge computing. Of course, everyone is moving towards centralized compute plus more sensors. And that's what we are able to offer today. Another kind of cool area is a perception module. So what does that mean? When we talk to a lot of our OEM contact partners, even Tier 1s, we think about self-driving. A lot of these customers want to do their own -- so self-driving a full stack is perception, planning, control. A lot of the OEMs wanted their own planning and control, right? They see that as their secret sauce.</p><p>What they don't have the capability of doing is perception, right, which is a lot more deep learning. It's fusing all these different sensor modalities from radars, camera, LiDAR, GPS even and giving them the signal that they need to be able to process their planning and control module. And so think of this as an integrated piece of system with both different sensors plus the domain controller with the application code to give a very precise perception that then can be sold to the OEM for them to do their own planning control. And that's actually -- to be honest, you ask every OEM that's -- deep down, that's what they want to do in this.</p><p>And lastly is Level 4 compute. And that is starting off with the TDC can be -- replaces the vehicle control unit. So today, every truck has -- every vehicle has a VCU. And this thing -- with VCU, it's a very, very reliable chip, but it doesn't do too much. It's not a very smart chip. This domain controller replaces the VCU. There's already VCU in the domain controller. And the benefit is if your overall system goes down, this level of redundancy can at least allow the vehicle to cruise for a standard amount of time and to safely pull over, which is very important, as we mentioned before, especially if you're driving on a highway. And the next generation of our TDC can fully replace the central compute and that can go into production trucks.</p><p>So the one piece of hardware that we are spending a lot of money actively developing is the one that quite frankly, requires both a very strong understanding of software in order to develop. And that's something that today in the industry has always been a chicken/egg. And so we're proud of this, and we will see more announcements in terms of commercial progress on this domain controller.</p><p>And lastly, for better or for worse, when we started the company in 2015, having operations in U.S. and China was seen as a cool thing. It was a good thing, right, you lower cost, resources in China. And of course, the market here in the U.S. is more ready to commercialize. Over time, especially with geopolitical tension, we recognized this. We basically separated 2 businesses. Today, they share a few common public company treasury functions, compliance functions. There are certain things that the China operations effectively is a supplier to the U.S. in terms of certain hardware and data annotation. So we have very cheap data annotation because of our operations in China.</p><p>But again, these are really sort of the few touch points we have. And so we do have 2 independent entities. And we have been actively looking at how to unlock value here. You can argue in both sides, you can have multibillion-dollar companies in self-driving. And so how do we unlock value for shareholders, and that's something that we continue to evaluate.</p><p>So lastly, in terms of 2023, now we are in the process of bringing on a new auditor. So we will have that hopefully announced soon and be able to release our guidance officially. A few -- 3 buckets -- 4 buckets. One is we are, in terms of capitalization, probably better capitalized than many players out there. We still have very close to $1 billion of cash on hand. With 5% interest rates now, we can actually make some money off the cash. In terms of revenue, we are going to have -- bring down the revenue from last year. And that's because, really, we want to put every dollar to the most -- highest ROI for shareholders and for technology development. It doesn't make sense to have $10 million of revenue while losing $4 million.</p><p>We're providing freight capacity at loss before because, one, money was cheap; two, the freight capacity was tight and some of our partners wanted it. And the idea was, ultimately, over time, we'll automate sort of the lanes that we're already in. And we made a conscious decision in December to scale that down and only focus only on the lanes that we want to automate today or this year or next year. So you'll see a decline in revenue, and that's driven by -- that's intentionally driven.</p><p>In terms of OpEx, we proactively did a restructuring when I joined back in November. We reduced about 25% of the workforce. The reality is every technology company over the last few years grew too fast, right? And that's going to save at least $60 million on the -- well, $60 million just on the comp for the wages. Of course, besides wages, there's other OpEx that leads to cost savings. And so today, we do have -- we do believe we'll have multiple years of run rate given the cash position that we have. And we'll continue to optimize the OpEx. I mean we have to, as a company in this industry, be smart about this. I mean it's -- we've got to prepare for a longer winter, right? We can assume that the hype for self-driving is going to come back in a year or 2 years, and we have to really march towards getting some product out the door. And so that's how we position our balance sheet. And the CapEx also reflects that mentality.</p><p>And lastly, in terms of long-term framework, now we had a setback last year where, I think, in a good position to overcome [many of those things] and we've done a lot over the last few months. We believe we're still the technology leader in self-driving trucks. There's tremendous value, intrinsic value that we bring to the table.</p><p>In terms of commercialization, this is with everybody else, we're launching our self-operated fleet first because this is something we don't want to sell to third party, something we can validate ourselves or using retrofitted vehicles today to operate -- no different than robotaxis.</p><p>And actually, there's a clear path to basically getting cash flow breakeven with about 500 trucks. I mean 1 truck, 14 hours a day, 50 miles an hour, 300 days a week -- sorry, 300 days a year gets you about $600,000 of revenue. And with 500, that's close to $300 million. And so -- now of course, there's gross margin out there. But there is actually a path to getting to very close to breakeven with 500 trucks. We can do that with a few lanes. We can do that with the technology that we have today now with a little bit more work.</p><p>And lastly, when you get to sort of tens of thousands of vehicles, of course, that's where we want to get to, that is something that the OEMs have to produce themselves. It's got to be a factory-produced integrated vehicle at the OEM. The OEM has to validate it, has to provide warranties, manufacturing support. And the reality is, in this case, we're a supplier to OEM, right? We have to enable -- help enable the OEMs and we have to work on the OEM's timeline. And that's something that we have learned the last 2 years working with OEM partners. And that timeline is being pushed back, right? That's not a secret. That's just the industry is being reset and things that were set to be 2024 are now quite closer to 2026. So that's something that I think it's -- that we just had to account for.</p><p>So with that, I'll end the presentation part. And hopefully, that gives an overview of some of the initiatives we're working on.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: Yes. Thanks, Cheng. I feel like we needed that update and there's a lot going on. And I think we'll probably have to come back to those slides afterwards to catch all the details. But that really was comprehensive. Clearly, the industry, the company has undergone several changes. But just to come back to the -- because the focus for a lot of pre-revenue companies now is cash. Clearly, the balance sheet has got $1 billion. You've made some adjustments when you came back on.</p><p>But just coming back to the, I guess, the smaller scale with just focusing on the Arizona route. So can that -- it sounds like you can still see a path to breakeven, rather. With the smaller route, you need like a couple of those. You don't need to go to Texas. Like how should we think about the smaller scale with probably a smaller cost structure and then getting to that near-term target?</p><p>CHENG LU: Great question. I mean, every day, there's about 20,000 Class A trucks that pass the I-10 -- any given point of the I-10. And so Phoenix to Tucson is a start, I think, with a few routes. I do -- we do have plans to go Texas, but it's important, just like robotaxi, right? You want to get 1 city right first and then move on to the next one. And so that's how we're starting. So if you can have Phoenix to Tucson, if you can get to Long Beach to Phoenix over the next 2 years, even better, and then 1 or 2 routes in Texas, that's more than enough to absorb 500 trucks.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: Okay. Got it. So in terms of the -- I think it was out just a little while ago, the FMCSA mentioned the finalized review. Clearly, safety is at the core of this offering and the value proposition. I would agree the nuclear verdicts are not going away anytime soon. But I think the autonomous technology is probably still held to a different standard, at least for the near term. But what were some of the -- you highlighted a few of them, but what were some of the stakeholder reactions after that was all said and done?</p><p>It seems like FMCSA was, hopefully, you learned from that process. I'm sure they were appreciative of all the data that you shared. But what are some of the other takeaways from that? And do you think that the industry overall and perception is like, yes, there will be autonomous truck accidents, but there will be a lot fewer than human. Do you think people have really got to that point? Or is it still held to a higher standard like this is a robo driver that should be superhuman?</p><p>CHENG LU: Yes. I mean it is still -- it's definitely still held to a higher standard. And unfortunately -- I mean not unfortunately, but that is, I think, human nature. If you look at our safety record, actually, it is better than human-driven -- most human -- most fleets out there. The FMCSA incidents, we -- I think one of the misconceptions is this is something to do with our algorithm, with our core technology. And it's something that we afterwards had improved -- made improvements to our operations. So one of the things, learnings is I think we had to manage the freedom in terms of what the test operator could do.</p><p>And so again, that's not the human error. It's our fault, I think, for having -- allowing right, that possibility to be there. Second was there was a -- that particular test run, it was already out of ODD. There were some nodes flashing red, and I think the system still didn't turn on. And so there was a series of sort of events that led to us not catching the fact that there was a hard jerk with a steering wheel. And that's not an algorithm issue. That's a system integration in terms of the latency between kind of the different components in the system.</p><p>And so we had to had more gatekeepers in the system and how we kind of -- that's a whole part of functional safety, SOTIF, that's the area of engineering that we'll continue to improve on. And so I think it was a lot of good learnings. And look, these things will -- that's a part of life, right, that there will be incidents, and we have to do our best to, one -- 2 things, make sure that we have a very comprehensive safety case framework. Because usually what happens is when you have an incident, then the regulators say, well -- because regulators don't give you like a box to say, this is how you have to solve everything.</p><p>Because when you have an incident, the regulators then come and say, well, did you do the right things? Were you logical enough and look at right things? So then I can't go and say, well, we should have done that. And so that's where having a comprehensive safety case framework, having third-party auditors is important because then we can justify look, we did the right things, right? Like accidents do happen, but we weren't negligent. We didn't do something clearly, obviously, that we should have done. And so I think that's -- a lot of effort has gone into that over the last several years.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: So in terms of the industry, we've obviously seen a lot of things change. We've seen one of your competitors, looks like they're going to start to wind down operations. So from your vantage point, is there consolidation that might happen in this space? I know it's mostly people is the key aspect of it, but are there other potentials to see some -- maybe some horizontal mergers?</p><p>And then conversely, it seems like from a lot of the updates you're giving here today and you've been working on that you're going a little bit more into -- with the domain controller, with some of these other functions that could actually be a little bit upstream into like a Tier 1 or to an OEM. So it seems like there's maybe -- as with a lot of industries to just start, there's a lot of figuring out what the structure will be. So is your view changed on that at all? And what do you see like in the next couple of years?</p><p>CHENG LU: Yes. I mean, I think, certainly, there will be consolidation, there will be companies that don't make it. With any sort of technology company, a lot of new tech -- when I first saw the technology hype curve, I was like, \"Oh, that's kind of cute,\" but actually most tech -- new tech does kind of go through that curve, right? We had the last few years, this inflated expectation of where AV is going to go. That sentiment is coming down.</p><p>It's coming back to reality. I think the view is Level 4 is still quite far away and spend a lot of money. So the way we position is, we're marching very fast to Level 4, right? That is our goal. But for the next wave, again, we can't rely on hype. We have to get real products out the door that are meaningful to customers, that can create cash flow. And so the domain controller is something that actually we preplan and it wasn't something we just started this year, it was something we were working on for the last 2 years almost, and that has unlocked more opportunities. So if we can be a next-generation Mobileye plus a real path to Level 4 self-driving, that's something that I think positions us differently, of course, with the balance sheet that we have today.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: In terms of a lot of what investors with this long-term path and the big TAM we're trying to figure out the near-term milestones in self-driving. The driverless pilot program was a big one of those. So clearly, there's supply chain issues that are going to make this more challenging and the industry itself is maturing. But what would you say for us to kind of keep a closer eye on? Before, it was, I think, the Union Pacific pilot program, which had a little bit of a delay because of construction, I think.</p><p>But -- so the freight world gets in the way sometimes. But what should we focus on in terms of the next steps, the milestones, where I think you guys have been really good at in terms of laying those out there. But of course, with a longer potentially time horizon in different nodes in terms of monetization, there's probably a little bit of a different path we should be considering here.</p><p>CHENG LU: Yes. I think there's -- sort of think of it as 2 paths. One is -- the hardest problem in this industry is always sort of defining where the end goal is and where we are relative to that end goal or whatever the goal is. And what I laid out in terms of what does it take to automate 1 freight lane for commercial launch? It's expanding safety, increased reliability, reduction cost. And so from that framework, over the next several quarters, right, we'll give you updates on that. And so at least that shows investors and partners that we are marching towards this systematic framework and we're one step closer every time.</p><p>The second path is the domain controller, what that can unlock, and we hope to give more updates in terms of commercial partnerships on that area. So I think these 2 paths, there will be more exciting things to look out for.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: And I think you said the domain controller was first half '24, roughly speaking?</p><p>CHENG LU: In terms of production. That's right.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: Production. Okay. Okay. So maybe just to close out here the last couple of minutes that we have, if you can just give us an update if anything has changed in terms of the partnerships. Level of interest, I would assume, is still pretty high even though the freight market is a little bit softer right now. But clearly, the company has been through a lot of changes. So how is that -- and the Navistar partnership was dissolved. So where do you stand from that perspective?</p><p>And then also just because I think we've seen more recent news again on the Board and Xiaodi resigning. It seems like maybe that part is closer to being resolved but not quite all the way there. So maybe you can just -- because I don't think you've covered that part in the presentation, but maybe more recent news. But that would also be helpful just to see when that, I guess, settles down is maybe not the right word, but at least when that becomes less of a focal point.</p><p>CHENG LU: Sure. I mean I think all of the issues that happened last year -- look, the reality is it damaged our credibility and reputation. We lost partners, where partners -- sort of the main message was, look, you guys still have the best technology, but get your house in order first, right? I mean as you can expect, especially a lot of partners with big brand names, that's kind of first reaction to have.</p><p>So we're actually in the process of rebuilding some of these partnerships. And in a way, we're starting from a very low point. And I think each of these partnerships that we've built hopefully gets us back to where we were before. And with the OEM, with Navistar -- I mean TRATON is still one of our large shareholders. The Navistar relationship in terms of joint development agreement, that was canceled. And we are in discussions with OEMs. And it doesn't impact our near-term launch -- commercial launch, but long term in terms of getting 10,000 trucks, of course, that's something that we have to find a clear path for.</p><p>And the one thing in this space is -- which gives me comfort, I guess, ultimately, is that the number of credible, self-driving companies is smaller than number of OEMs out there. And so I do think that this technology obviously is needed and wanted by not only shippers, but also the hardware providers. And so I think I do feel confident that as we work through some of these issues that we'll be able to announce more partnerships there.</p><p>In terms of our former CEO, Xiaodi, today, he's no longer part of the company. Starting November, he was only a Board member and not day to day. And so after him resigning from the Board last week, I think that's, again, another sort of thing for us now to move forward. He's obviously a smart guy, but I think in terms of where we need to go next, in terms of really the engineering effort, it's not so much developing algorithms, right? It's more about making the system reliable, functional, going through the (inaudible) and all the stuff.</p><p>I think the team today certainly not only has the software and algorithm knowledge but has strong knowledge in terms of getting to a commercial launch. So lots of unfortunate things happened last year, but we are turning the page and in a position to move forward.</p><p>BRIAN PATRICK OSSENBECK: Yes. When you came back for a reason, I would assume. So it's good to talk to you again. Good to see again. Clearly, a lot to digest here, but we'll have to end there because we have run out of time. But thank you very much for making time for us today. I appreciate it, Cheng.</p><p>CHENG LU: Thanks, Brian.

'Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.' <br/>A plurality of Americans overall, 47.9%, believe 'Trump's political enemies' were behind the raid, according to a Trafalgar group poll. contrast with 39.7% who attributed it to 'the impartial justice system' and 12.4% who were not sure. <br/>[77] <br/><br/>Media Stopped Describing Targeting of Trump as 'Raid' After Former FBI Agent Complained[94] <br/>The media stopped describing the search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate as a 'raid' after a top former FBI agent complained about the wording during an appearance on MSNBC. <br/>Federal agents ransacked Trump's Florida home, even going through his wife Melania's wardrobes, in a bid to find classified records Trump allegedly took from the White House. <br/>Trump supporters assert that the boxes recovered during the raid contain files that were already declassified by the time Trump left office. <br/>[77] <br/><br/>Miami OnlyFans Model Captured on Video Beating Boyfriend She Later Killed[95] <br/>OnlyFans model Courtney Clenney was captured on surveillance video assaulting Christian Obumseli in the elevator of their luxury Miami apartment building just two months before she allegedly killed him with a kitchen knife, authorities said Thursday. <br/>Miami-Dade State Attorney Kathie Fernandez Rundle played the video at a press conference when she announced a second-degree murder charge against 26-year-old Clenney. <br/>'The defendant was aggressively attacking Christian,' Rundle said of the Feb. 21 footage that shows Clenney in a white bra and pajama pants smashing elevator buttons before turning her rage on Obumseli. <br/>[77] <br/><br/>Postal Service Announces Rate Hikes Over Holiday Season[96] <br/>The U.S. Postal Service announced this week that it would be hiking rates starting in October through January in order to cover increased costs associated with the holiday shipping season. <br/>The USPS said in a news release on Thursday that it had 'filed notice today with the Postal Regulatory Commission regarding a temporary price adjustment for key package products for the 2022 peak holiday season.' <br/>[77] <br/><br/>Soros Pushes Left-Wing Reforms for US Judiciary[97] <br/>In the run-up to the US midterms elections, the big speculator and 'philanthropist' George Soros has found a new field of activity. He now excels at funding American prosecutors who want to 'reform' the US justice system. Republican politicians and lawyers are outraged. They blame Soros for the increase in violence in the country. <br/>An op-ed by Soros, in which he openly admits to supporting progressive US prosecutors, has drawn sharp criticism. 'My tools are intended to give a public voice to sensible, reform-minded candidates,' Soros wrote on July 31. His contribution is entitled: 'Why I Support Reform Prosecutors'. <br/>Soros wants to counter 'injustices in the system', which he believes are responsible for the increase in violence and murder in the US. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report in May showed the highest rate of gun murders in 2020 in 25 years. <br/>With his cash injection, Soros supports the agenda of progressive US politicians and officials 'for a more efficient and fairer justice system'. The financial resources of the criminal justice system should primarily be used for prevention and therapy instead of criminal prosecution. <br/>[77] <br/><br/>Texas Gov. Abbott Hires Dozens of Officers in Uvalde School District After Shooting[98] <br/>Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday announced that he would hire more than 30 officers to bolster the Uvalde school district's security after a devastating mass shooting earlier this year. <br/>Robb Elementary School became the site of a horrific tragedy when 18-year-old alleged gunman Salvador Ramos entered the school in May and killed 19 children and two faculty members.

However, the numbers in highly Muslim influenced and Muslim influenced areas may be higher than the estimation as Muslim population growth, infiltration etc. has been moderately high during this period 2011 and 2022 further. <br/>More than are quite few, we have tried to list up the districts where Muslim population is more than or equal to the state overall percentage as below.

off-platform intelligence into learning sets' so that AI can detect online abuse before it ever reaches mainstream platforms. <br/>The Forum says this is necessary to stop the proliferation of everything from child abuse to extremism, disinformation, hate speech, and fraud. <br/>[77] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://hinduexistence.org\">http://hinduexistence.org</url>/ [ 2]:

Moran. SHAWN EDWARD WILLIAMS, 49, was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release for theft of public property and setting timber afire. At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle said that \"the consequences of your actions . . . resulted in horrendous consequences to the forests.\"</p><p>According to records filed in the case, between April and August 2018, lead defendant Justin Andrew Wilke conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal. In July 2018, just days after his release from state prison, WILLIAMS joined the conspiracy, helping Wilke remove maple from the National Forest and transporting it with Wilke to a mill in Tumwater, Washington. The type of maple harvested by the defendants is highly prized and used to produce musical instruments.</p><p>On August 3, 2018, the group decided to cut a maple tree that contained a wasp's nest near the base of the tree. To remove the nest, the group sprayed insecticide and gasoline on the nest and base of the tree and then lit the nest on fire. The group failed to extinguish the fire, which developed into a wildfire later named the \"Maple Fire.\" The Maple Fire consumed more than 3,300 acres between August and November 2018 and cost approximately $4.2 million to contain. WILLIAMS did not himself set the fire, but was present when others set the fire.</p><p>WILLIAMS pleaded guilty in December 2019.</p><p>In their sentencing memo, prosecutors highlighted the danger of Wilke and WILLIAMS's conduct. \"Forest fires present a dire and growing threat in this region. They destroy our forests, poison our air, and endanger responders, local residents, recreationalists, and wildlife. When this fire occurred in early August 2018, the Puget Sound region was (as it is today) already experiencing significant smoke from existing wildfires, and the high risk of fire was evident to everyone in Western Washington. Despite this atmosphere, Williams participated in taking the extreme risk of setting fire to a portion of a tree-deep in the forest, in mid-summer. The consequences of that decision-thousands of acres burned, millions of dollars in containment costs, and the release of huge amounts of smoke-were easily foreseeable.\"</p><p>The case was investigated by the United States Forest Service. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Will Dreher.</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Press contact for the U.S. Attorney's Office is Communications Director Emily Langlie at (206) 553-4110 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov\">Emily.Langlie@usdoj.gov</email></p><p>Updated September 21, 2020</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-JDP9210G8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GOVPUB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WT-YHC1-DYVR-P1VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247474</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Justice Department Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Other Americans aren't so lucky.</p><p>People in California, Oregon, and Washington are living in some twisted version of the \"This is fine\" meme. Their red and orange skies are filling with ash as President Trump blames poor forest management, rather than climate change, for these deadly wildfires. In 2020 alone, wildfires have burned over 6 million acres of land in the U.S. Thousands of firefighters, over a thousand of which are inmates, are currently battling over 100 large fires out west. So far, at least 35 people have died and dozens have been declared missing.</p><p>When told that the White House needs to listen to science to protect against future wildfires, Trump responded, \"I don't think science knows.\" Maybe he didn't understand that the \"science is a liar sometimes\" bit from \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" was a joke.\u00a0</p><p>Or maybe his campaign is funded by fossil fuel leaders and lobbyists who profit off of his anti-science stance. We'll just never know.</p><p>While humans start over 90% of forest fires (Smokey the Bear really needs to work on increasing his audience), climate change provides prime conditions for these fires to grow and spread. These factors include fuel availability (sticks, brush, fallen trees, etc.), fuel moisture content (preferably dry), wind (the faster it is, the more the fire will spread), and lightning strikes.</p><p>Researchers found that among larger class fires (between sizes of 300 and 5,000 acres), there was a strong negative correlation between fire activity and pre-fire season soil moisture content. Basically, the drier the soil, the more likely there will be fires during fire season.</p><p>Dr. Philip Duffy, President and Executive Director of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, stresses that the planet is undoubtedly warming every year. Among other environmental crises, it's clear that this temperature increase has intensified forest fires.\u00a0</p><p>Duffy says the hot, dry weather that results from climate change creates \"fuel conditions\" (mainly dried-out forests) that are \"conducive to fire.\" These conditions help fires spread their destruction as far as possible.</p><p>Good forest management can reduce risk, Duffy says, but he emphasizes that the best solution is to stop releasing so many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p><p>We can't ignore science if we want to limit the number of environmental crises we experience every year. Our perilous situation will only get worse, not just in the forest fire-prone western U.S., but around the entire world. Trump's inaction and lies about climate change and science are killing Americans and will harm the rest of the world if we continue down this path.\u00a0</p><p>Yes, climate change is real. Yes, it's making fires worse. And no, we cannot wait to take action.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4753644</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WJ-GYK1-DY7P-T045-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Campus Times: University of Rochester</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 20, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Rochester</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Arugula. Chard. Escarole. Cabbage. <br/>\"And basil,\" said Altius Farms CEO Sally Herbert, plucking a bright leaf. \"Which you really should taste. Because it's magnificent.\" </p><p><br/>The vertical farm is one of many Colorado models for coping with increasing water scarcity in the western United States, as climate change makes droughts more frequent and more severe. <br/>Other projects have Coloradans testing water recycling and building barriers against the wildfire runoff that can taint supplies. <br/>Colorado is hardly alone. A major U.N. climate report published recently notes that half the world's population is already seeing severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year. In the U.S. West, drought and earlier runoff from an increasingly diminished snowpack will increase water scarcity during the summer, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said. <br/>While Colorado so far has met the water needs of its 6 million residents, it could face a roughly 30% shortfall by 2050 as the population grows while climate impacts escalate, according to one likely scenario experts prepared for the state's official Water Plan <url normalizedValue=\"https://cwcb.colorado.gov/colorado-water-plan/technical-update-to-the-plan\">https://cwcb.colorado.gov/colorado-water-plan/technical-update-to-the-plan</url>. <br/>Already, the region's worst drought in more than a century has left water levels starkly low in the Lake Mead reservoir supplying Colorado River water to neighboring states. <br/>\"It's mind-blowing,\" Herbert said. <br/>FARMING UPWARD <br/>No one fix will ensure future water quality, quantity and affordability. Approaches such as water recycling have faced regulatory gaps and public resistance. <br/>Vertical farming, meanwhile, won't work at the scale needed for staple crops like corn or wheat. And while Altius uses mostly natural light to grow 25,000 pounds (11,300 kg) of produce each year on its 7,000-square-foot rooftop, others rely on lamps and electricity. That can make the produce grown pricier. <br/>Still, vertical farms use 95% less water than traditional farming. Other benefits can include reduced transportation costs, with produce grown closer to where consumers live. And foods that can be grown indoors can be a boon outside of temperate regions, said Michael Dent, an agriculture and food technology analyst at the IDTechEx market research group. <br/>Such benefits are luring investment: Georgia-based multinational Kalera is now repurposing a warehouse near Denver's airport - close to highways and supermarket distribution centers. The company, founded in 2010, grows produce in the Middle East, Asia and Europe, with plans to expand further. <br/>Retail giant Walmart Inc in January joined a $400 million funding round by the San Francisco vertical startup Plenty, a deal still subject to regulatory approval. <br/>And last year, New York-based vertical startup Bowery Farming raised $300 million in a funding round. <br/>It can be tough to assess a vertical farm's overall environmental footprint. A farm run on wind power will have fewer polluting carbon emissions than one run on fossil fuels, for example. <br/>Kalera Chief Commercial Officer Henner Schwarz said there's \"frankly speaking, a lot of smoke and mirrors. Everybody has the 'most sustainable technology' and lots of blah, blah.\" <br/>\"But when it comes to water savings, I'm actually very confident in saying that we use only 3% of the water traditional agriculture would use,\" Schwarz said. <br/>'LIQUID GOLD' <br/>At a home construction site, a plumbing crew huddled around a black, refrigerator-size piece of technology. <br/>Once hooked up, the system would siphon off and filter shower and bath water, removing skin cells, soap and hair before sending the water back to the toilets for flushing. \"This is the first one that has taken the filtration to this level,\" said Todd Moritzky, the plumbing company's owner. <br/>His crew were working on a house construction by Lennar in Castle Rock, south of Denver. Lennar said using the filtration system, made by the Canadian company Greyter, in earlier builds had cut home water use by up to 25%. <br/>\"Water is liquid gold here,\" said Eric Feder, Lennar's Colorado-based director of national efforts to embrace homebuilding innovations. The company would like to make Greyter systems the standard in its homes, he said. <br/>But in Colorado, Castle Rock along with Denver and Pitkin County are the only three communities that allow in-home water recycling. <br/>\"Plumbing codes, ordinances, local regulations are just catching up to that technology availability,\" said Pat Sinicropi, head of the WateReuse trade association. <br/>Castle Rock gets less than 15 inches (38 cm) of precipitation a year. The town, with a population of 70,000, is projected to grow to 100,000 by 2060. It is aiming to reduce its daily water consumption from about 115 gallons per person to below 100 gallons within a decade. <br/>\"We fully intend to achieve it,\" said Mark Marlowe, director of Castle Rock Water. The utility now offers home developers fee discounts if they install systems such as Greyter's. <br/>SAFE TO DRINK <br/>Just south of Castle Rock in Colorado Springs, Tzahi Cath has been working with the local utility to demonstrate that recycled wastewater can be used not just to flush toilets, but also for drinking. <br/>The Colorado School of Mines engineering professor and his students in Golden built a portable water treatment laboratory to further process the utility's partly treated wastewater so that its safe for consumption. <br/>The idea isn't new. Singapore has been treating sewage and recycling the water back into its reservoirs since 2003. San Diego, California, is building sewage recycling infrastructure. And Cath's desert homeland of Israel is a world leader in desalinating seawater for drinking and treating wastewater for irrigation use. <br/>Cath produced a half-million gallons of potable water from June through December - serving nearly 1,000 people who visited his lab. Most of those taste testers deemed the water good. <br/>\"The state needs to start investing and utilities need to start building the infrastructure\" to allow utilities to clean and deliver reclaimed waste water for drinking, Cath said. <br/>State officials are urging citizens to conserve water, while they also look to boost funding for infrastructure. <br/>The state needs at least 10 times the $25 million currently allotted in its annual budget for the Department of Natural Resources, which funds water projects, according to the state's official Water Plan. <br/>FIRE TAINT <br/>Apart from concerns about having enough water, Colorado is facing an increasing threat of wildfires sullying the supplies it does have. <br/>Last summer, the college town of Fort Collins had to let some Cache la Poudre River water flow away after it was contaminated with ash and debris from a forest fire the year before. <br/>Wildfires wipe out vegetation that would normally soak up some rainwater, leading to erosion and contaminated runoff for years. A study published in this month's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences warned of an increase in hazards such as flooding and landslides in burned out areas of the U.S. West. <br/>Fort Collins also has a water reservoir, so losing some from the Poudre supply wasn't an immediate crisis. <br/>Workers have been building permanent structures, at a cost of some $300,000, to block fire debris from getting into the water treatment plant, said Mark Kempton, interim deputy director for utilities at Fort Collins Water Resources &amp; Treatment. <br/>In the future, Kempton said, we could see \"fire response becoming part of regular water rate increases.\" <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

It's unacceptable to me, or to any Montanan, that we are doing so with outdated aircraft,\" said Governor Bullock.</p><p>\"It couldn't be clearer that the President is choosing to fund his border wall over keeping our citizen soldiers and Airmen safe. By that matter, he's choosing a vanity project over honoring those who defend our freedom and liberty and keep our communities safe. I won't stand idly by until Montana's National Guard members are given what they are owed,\" continued Governor Bullock.</p><p>Montana Air National Guard members are currently operating a C-130H fleet from 1974 that utilizes technology no longer used by the airlines and equipment the Active Duty Air Force no longer uses.</p><p>Congress appropriated $3.8 billion, including $196 million for Air National Guard C-130J aircraft. That funding would have supported efforts to update Montana's C-130H fleet to the modern C-130Js. The Trump Administration is reprogramming these dollars for construction of the southern border wall.</p><p>Governor Bullock also sent a letter asking Senator Daines and Congressman Gianforte to join in requesting for an end to the reprogramming. The letter is attached.</p><p>The National Governors Association today expressed opposition to the reprogramming. The full statement can be found at this link. The Adjutants General Association of the United States, including General Quinn of Montana, expressed how reprogramming impacts the National Guard budget.

When IoT fleet managers need to switch network providers - whether that's to expand to new regions or improve reliability and uptime - physically swapping SIM cards is a costly and cumbersome task. Twilio's support of the eSIM standard allows companies to load Twilio's multi-carrier Super SIM profile onto their devices over-the-air, in addition to eSIM profiles from other providers, and then switch between the different SIM profiles as needed. This eliminates the need to physically interact with the devices, all while improving the end user experience by delivering best-in-class IoT connectivity.</p><p>eSIMs alone require integration with multiple carriers for each SIM profile, therefore requiring IoT builders to manage several carrier relationships and deal with varied bills and complex technical differences. Twilio's Super SIM has solved this problem by providing multiple subscriber identities on a single SIM (and now a single eSIM profile) and autonomously switching them, based on which country the device is in - all while offering customers full control over which networks to use. Twilio Super SIM's multi-carrier approach - with one simple bill for all and only one cellular IoT vendor relationship to manage - enables seamless global deployments, and consistent network behavior across all 300+ supported networks, which significantly reduces development and integration effort. To IoT devices, Twilio's cellular solution essentially behaves like one gigantic global network with one simple API and the same behavior everywhere.</p><p>Businesses that have already begun adopting eSIM can now bring the benefits of Twilio Super SIM to their IoT devices by downloading a Super SIM eSIM profile onto their existing eSIM hardware. Twilio's multi-carrier approach paired with the new support for eSIM/eUICC provides innovative flexibility for enterprises deploying IoT devices internally and solution providers selling B2B or B2C IoT solutions to the market.</p><p>\"We're excited to expand Relay's coverage by adding Twilio's Super SIM as an eSIM profile,\" said Matt Newton, senior vice president of hardware at Relay, makers of smart walkie-talkies for frontline teams. \"Using Twilio's robust API, we can download the Super SIM profile over-the-air to our fleet of devices and then use the firmware on our devices to switch profiles dynamically. That depth of control enables us to provide the highest quality connectivity and gives our customers an incredible experience with our product.\"</p><p>eSIMs in general are ideally suited for devices that stay in use for many years - such as wearables, medical devices and home automation systems - where the lifetime of the device is much longer than commercial agreements with connectivity providers. They are commonly used when the cost of swapping the SIM is expensive, for example to recall an automobile back to the dealer to swap a SIM. eSIMs are also becoming the technology of choice for those devices that can't be easily opened to swap out SIMs, as is the case with wearables, or those that can't be easily accessed, including billboards, air quality, or forest fire monitors.</p><p>\"There are essentially 2 types of eSIM profiles in the market today: Consumer Profiles, and Machine to Machine (M2M) Profiles. While the latter was originally intended to cater to IoT, we believe Consumer Profiles are in most cases a much better fit for IoT devices,\" said Vijay Devarapalli, principal product manager at Twilio IoT. \"While M2M Profiles require additional infrastructure elements, Consumer Profiles allow customers to lower their operational effort and reduce their dependency on vendors for cellular IoT.\"</p><p>Twilio invites device makers or enterprises that have embraced eSIM already, have a Local Profiles Assistant (LPA) in their IoT device, and are in need of global connectivity, to trial Twilio's Super SIM on eSIM. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2Fgo%2Fsupersim-esim-pilot-1&amp;esheet=52434854&amp;newsitemid=20210525005343&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Register+now&amp;index=2&amp;md5=9c0a7ff8f3f62889204aa10d1fb2b096\">Register now</url> for the Twilio eSIM pilot program.</p><p>About Twilio IoT<br/>Millions of developers around the world use Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience.

Please give thanks to your firefighters.\"</p><p>The fire was reported about 1:20 p.m. Thursday near the 9500 block of North San Gabriel Canyon Road, also called Highway 39, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, which was assisting Angeles National Forest crews.</p><p>The blaze grew from about 25 acres to 240 acres in less than two hours, first forcing evacuations of campers in the West Fork area of the forest and soon other areas of the forest, according to the Glendora Police Department and the U. S. Forest Service.</p><p>The estimated acreage was downgraded to 217 acres on Friday morning, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department.</p><p>\"This evacuation is not in a developed residential area but it's in some of the recreation areas in the forest,\" Marc Peebles, public information officer with California Incident Management Team 13, told a CBS2 reporter at the scene late Thursday afternoon. \"Essentially, the evacuation area is on Highway 39, north of Old San Gabriel Canyon Road.</p><p>\"The Crystal Lake recreation area has been evacuated, the West Fork and East Fork recreation area has been evacuated, and it's mainly visitors recreating in the forest. There's some ... special-use cabins up there, as well at the Coldbrook Campground and the San Gabriel off-highway vehicle staging area.\"</p><p>Highway 39 is closed to all traffic through at least Sunday, the Azusa Police Department said, adding non-residents will not be allowed to continue beyond the El Encanto Restaurant.</p><p>About 250 Angeles National Forest firefighters and about 100 Los Angeles County firefighters battled the blaze on the ground on Thursday, with more than a dozen aircraft also working to quell the flames.</p><p>\"It's very, very steep rugged terrain. Some of it is near vertical, especially right off of Highway 39 here,\" Peebles said Thursday. \"It's thick brush, it's hot, it's dry, it's steep. We've got a little bit of breeze that you see ... The fire doesn't appear to be terribly wind-driven at this point. It's mainly driven by slope and heat.\"</p><p>VIVA Rescue, a nonprofit organization specializing in rescuing horses, offered in a Twitter post to help evacuate animals -- \"equines, livestock and domestic pets\" -- from the forest.

A recent study, based on a comprehensive database of fire occurrences (Wildfire Atlas of China, WFAC)1, concluded that the majority of fire activity in China is concentrated in its tropical and subtropical forests and significantly driven by ENSO. Here we demonstrate that a very different picture emerges when wildfire activity is assessed from burned area instead. Using fire occurrences as the sole indicator of fire activity, particularly to compare regions with markedly different fire regimes, may lead to incomplete descriptions of fire activity with potential implications for fire policy recommendations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burned area fraction across China\u2019s subtropical forests is low nationally and globally</emphasis>We assessed patterns in the burned area during 2001\u20132020 from the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) MCD64A1 burned area product, using previously curated and compiled datasets2. We observed that only 10% of the burned area in China occurred within the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome of China (Fig. 1a, b, subtropical forests hereafter). The vast majority of the burned area (67%) occurred in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome, followed by the temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome (11%). Fang et al.1 concluded that wildfire activity was concentrated in the subtropical forests because this is where 84% of all fire events occurred1, but here we show that they only represent 10% of the total burned area (Fig. 1a, b). Even after removing the effect of agricultural fires (particularly common in northeast China3), the burned area outside the subtropical biome remains at 74% of the total burned area (Supplementary Fig. 1). Burned area is a more comprehensive measure of continental or regional fire activity than fire occurrence, amongst others, because fire-size distributions differ across biomes4 and because the inverse of burned area approximates the fire cycle (that is, the number of years necessary to burn entirely a particular region).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burned area in China and in tropical biomes worldwide.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Map with China\u2019s biomes.

The annual fraction of burned area in Chinese subtropical forests was 0.2%, which is three times lower than the national average of 0.7% (Fig. 1c). The fraction of median annual burned area ranged from 0.006% for the desert and xeric shrublands biome to 1.6% for the flooded grasslands and savannas biome. We note that the MCD64A1 burned area product underestimates burned area, particularly in tropical and subtropical forests where cloudy days are common5. However, this effect is most important for small fires, while the burned area is primarily determined by large fires, where MODIS accuracy increases6. The comparatively small fraction of burned area in subtropical forests is consistent with the pyrogeographic principle that fire activity in moist tropical forests is putatively limited by its high humidity and fuel moisture7.</p><p>Fang et al.1 claimed that fire activity in China\u2019s subtropical forests is higher than in other subtropical forest regions. Recent estimates of the fraction of annual burned area across subtropical forests globally8 report a variation that ranges from 0.01% in Oceania up to 2.5% in Africa, with a global mean of 1.1% (Fig. 1d). The annual fraction of burned area in China\u2019s subtropical forests is five times lower (0.2% as previously stated) than the global average (Fig. 1d) and only higher than in Oceania\u2019s tropical forests. Consequently, China\u2019s tropical forests are amongst the lowest globally in terms of the annual fraction of burned area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No dipole in burned area between eastern and western subtropical forests</emphasis></p><p>Under the assumption that the bulk of fire activity occurs in subtropical China, the authors reported a dipole between fire occurrence in subtropical forest regions of southeastern and southwestern China. We tested whether this dipole also occurred for the burned area by examining the correlations between annual area burned across eastern and western subtropical ecoregions. If a dipole in fire activity exists, we should observe a negative east-west trend. However, correlations across eastern and western subtropical ecoregions were either non-significant (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &gt; 0.1) or positive (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.005 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> &gt; 0.5; Fig. 2a\u2013c), which is inconsistent with the notion of a dipole in fire activity.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">There is no dipole in the pattern of burned area between eastern and western tropical forests in China.</emphasis></p><p>We examined annual patterns of annual area burned in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> southwest China and its ecoregions, and in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> southeast China and its ecoregions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>Pearson correlations in annual burned area across ecoregions (one, two or three asterisks indicate significant correlations at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.05, &lt;0.01 and &lt;0.0001 respectively) were positive within eastern and within western ecoregions, and either positive or not-significant across eastern and western ecoregions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> We correlated monthly burned area and ENSO 3.4 SST index at different lags (0, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months) and show the highest correlation in absolute terms (significant correlations are indicated by a dot). Correlations in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> are indicated by the color. Ecoregion IDs from Dinerstein et al.14: 236, Jian Nan subtropical evergreen forests; 256, Northern Indochina subtropical forests; 268, South China-Vietnam subtropical evergreen forests; 642, Guizhou Plateau broadleaf and mixed forests; 643 Yunnan Plateau subtropical evergreen forests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENSO effects on burned area weak or nonsignificant</emphasis></p><p>Fang et al.1 further claimed that the mechanism driving the dipole lies in the differential effect of ENSO over climate across the nation and, consequently, fire activity. Although we did not observe the dipole in the burned area (Fig. 2a\u2013c) we did examine whether monthly area burned correlated with El Ni\u00f1o 3.4 SST index at different lags (lags 0, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months), following previous approaches appropriate for time series analyses9, and after dividing China in 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 grid cells1. There was a tendency for positive correlations to dominate over western subtropical forests and for negative correlations to dominate in eastern subtropical forests (Fig. 2d). However, the effect of ENSO over burned area was non-significant for over 53% of the subtropical biome and, when significant, the effect was rather weak (r&lt;|0.25|). The effect of ENSO over burned area thus ranges between nonsignificant and weak.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire suppression does not affect wildfire occurrence</emphasis></p><p>Mixing fire occurrence with wildfire activity is problematic also when trying to draw policy conclusions. Fang et al.1 examined the temporal pattern of fire numbers between 2005-18 and concluded that the application of a fire suppression policy after 1987 has contributed to decreases in fire occurrences after 2007. However, fire suppression is an effort to mitigate the results of a fire once it has started10. Consequently, fire suppression strictly affects the burned area, and not fire occurrence. Other aspects associated with fire planning, like awareness campaigns or fire bans, may act on fire occurrence. However, any relationship between fire occurrence and fire suppression will necessarily be artefactual because the latter does not affect the former.</p><p>We acknowledge that part of the discrepancy with Fang et al.1 may lie in the different scales used in these analyses. However, fire activity is a term that currently lacks a rigorous definition and should be used with caution. Fire occurrence depends primarily on the number of ignitions (along with other factors affecting fire detection such as climate, topography or vegetation), which, in turn, results from human activity1 and, in some areas, lightning11. Using fire occurrence as an indicator for fire activity is particularly problematic when comparing multiple biomes that show marked differences in fire regime, as we demonstrate here. Additionally, ENSO and fire suppression may both affect burned area, but there is currently no mechanism that can explain a mechanistic link between either of these processes and the number of fire events. Consequently, fire occurrence should not be used as a sole metric of fire activity.</p><p>We additionally note that burned area is not necessarily a reliable metric of fire impacts on ecosystems and society. Significant variation in severity and intensity may occur within a fire perimeter12. Additionally, damage to people and property are not captured by this metric13. While we caution against the use of a single metric to evaluate fire activity, we hope to have demonstrated that using fire occurrence alone is particularly problematic, and that the picture it paints is rather unrealistic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work has received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U20A20179, 31850410483), the Talent Proposals in Sichuan Province (2020JDRC0065), from Southwest University of Science and Technology (18ZX7131), the MICINN (RTI2018-094691-B-C31) and European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 101003890 project FirEUrisk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Fang, K.

The team has tracked the outbreak since last spring.</p><p>Other steps recommended by the team include providing economic aid to affected small businesses and families and preventing evictions and foreclosures.</p><p>Many local governments have imposed mask mandates since Gov. Doug Ducey last summer lifted a prohibition on such orders. The local mandates cover an estimated 90% of the state's population but enforcement is lax or non-existent in some places. A statewide measure, the modeling team wrote, \u201censures consistency and strengthens compliance.\"</p><p>Ducey early in the outbreak shut down schools, many businesses and other establishments but then relaxed the restrictions, leading to a virus surge that made Arizona a national hot spot last summer. He later reinstituted some restrictions.</p><p>Now, as in many states, cases and hospitalizations in Arizona have again surged in the wake of school and business reopenings and public weariness with COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>Arizona State University researchers on Nov. 19 projected that hospitals in the state will exceed their capacities unless steps are taken.</p><p>While not again imposing new general shutdown mandates, Ducey has taken steps to require masks in schools and help hospitals. He also has repeatedly urged Arizonans to wear masks and take other precautions against COVID-19 spread.</p><p>State Sen. Martin Quezada, D-Phoenix, endorsed the modeling team's recommendations. \u201cState leaders should have political courage and protect public health by enacting them now,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThese aren't unreasonable requests.\u201d</p><p>Asked for comment on the modeling team's letter, which was reported first by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/coronavirus/letter-to-adhs-arizona-covid-19-modeling-team-recommends-3-week-shutdown\">KNXV-TV</url>, Department of Health Services spokesman Steve Elliott said the agency was viewing the universities' forecasts and monitoring information from hospitals, local health departments and other sources.</p><p>\u201cWe are on high alert,\" Elliott said in an email, adding that mitigation measures such as limits on business occupancy restrictions remain in place.</p><p>The DHS director, Dr. Cara Christ, on Friday said in a video that Arizona faces significant spread and the holidays \u201chave the potential to further increase spread.\"</p><p>\u201cAll of the metrics continue heading in the wrong direction,\" she said. \u201cTo put it simply, people are letting down their guard.\u201d</p><p>The state on Saturday reported reported 4,136 additional known COVID-19 cases and 36 more deaths, increasing the state\u2019s totals to 322,774 cases and 6,624 deaths.</p><p>Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 continue to increase, reaching 2,383 as of Friday, including 553 patients in beds in intensive care units, according to the state's dashboard.</p><p>Seven-day rolling averages of daily new cases, daily deaths and COVID-19 testing positivity in Arizona all increased in the past two weeks, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project and Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>The new cases daily average rose from 2,116 on Nov. 13 to 3,849 on Friday while the daily deaths average rose from 21.1 to 23 and the positivity rate average went from 14.7% to 19.3%.</p><p>The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.</p><p>For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some \u2014 especially older adults and people with existing health problems \u2014 it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-d6ec0837c1c6933130a4993ba70a214820201128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61D4-9FX1-DYMD-61PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><timeReceived>9:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

But thanks to Democrat-run states and cities, we now can use our own American political environment for these disastrous, superlative comparisons. For example, in the past, if we wanted to express and emphasize a completely disastrous happening, we'd compare it to the 1945 allied carpet-bombing of Dresden, Germany in World War II, or the atomic destruction done to Nagasaki or Hiroshima in 1945 as the war in the Pacific began to close. </p><p>But thanks to the recent destruction that Democrat-run cities have experienced at the hands of incompetent Democrat mayors and governors, we no longer need to look anywhere else in the world outside the United States to come up with appropriate superlatives to make our point. Here are some relevant superlatives we can employ, at our own national expense, using Democrat targets to make the point: The fires of Hades are as hot as the 'mostly peaceful' burning buildings of Portland. The murder rate in New York (or Chicago, or Baltimore, or Seattle) is as high as an ISIS invasion in Syria under the Obama administration. The charcoal fire in my Hibachi is as hot as the most recent, out-of-control forest fire in California.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) The cave was as silent as a formerly wealthy and active shopping district in bombed-out New York. The sunset was as bright red as a BLM or ANTIFA fire-bomb protest in Seattle. The uninhabited South Seas island was as silent as Mayor De Blazio's Grand Central Station at rush hour. The Army's basic training tear gas facility burned the eyes as much as a typical 'peaceful protest' in Portland. The sulphur gas emitted by the volcano was as irritating to the eyes as a 'mostly peaceful' protest in Seattle. The Nazi Nuremberg war crimes trial in 1945 witnessed as many lies being told by its defendants as were told about Donald Trump in statements originating in the Democrat-run House of Representatives and in 'news' reports from CNN and the NYT. The sloth was as slow-moving, quiet and uninteresting as the mask-wearing Joe Biden. Some general rules when using superlatives related to Democrat-run cities and Democrat political tactics: Any reference comparing the German sneak attack on peaceful Poland, a move that triggered World War II, should refer to the totally illegal use for the Steele Dossier that blamed Donald Trump for Russian collusion. Any reference to misleading statements intended to redirect and downplay criminal behavior in Democrat-run cities, should make a tie-in with the Seattle mayor's 'summer of love' quote as her city exploded with fascist activity and deathly attacks on her citizens. Instead of saying a document is as phony as a three-dollar bill, one should say it was as phony as an FBI FISA court request.Wake up Right!

The exhibition, developed in conjunction with the war's 80th anniversary, captures the impact of the war on the Adirondacks, through both the experiences of the men and women who left to serve and those who stayed behind in the region. Titled From Wilderness to Warfront: The Adirondacks and World War II, the show features an extensive array of artifacts and ephemera, including photographs and scrapbooks; letters and journal entries; military uniforms and insignia; advertisements, signage, and graphic works that advanced the war effort at home and abroad; and a wide range of other objects. From Wilderness to Warfront also includes oral histories from two Adirondack veteransPrivate Charlie Smith and Lt. Colonel David Hanningwhose recollections and stories are captured for the first time as part of the exhibition. Those histories will also live on the ADKX website. The show will remain on view through ADKX's summer season, closing on September 30, 2021</p><p>To celebrate the formal opening of the summer season and to engage audiences further with the exhibition, ADKX will host a day of activities inspired by the World War II era. From 10:00 am to 4:00 pm on July 1, visitors will be able to enjoy big band sounds from the 1940s in a festive outdoor environment, decorated with red, white, and blue bunting and banners. Children will be able to draw their own \"dog tags\" and pose like Rosie the Riveter in a photo area, with images available to take home. Smith and Hanning will also be onsite to greet and talk to visitors about their experiences and the exhibition.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to welcome the public back to ADKX for the summer season and to share this exhibition, which offers an opportunity to explore the incredible contributions of Adirondack people to this critical moment in our global history. Many of the objects in the exhibition are on loan from current and former residents of the Adirondacks, so it is a particularly intimate and community focused presentation,\" said David Kahn, ADKX's Executive Director. \"We look forward to seeing people at the museum and on campus on July 1 for our opening celebration, which captures the spirit of the exhibition, and throughout the season.\"</p><p>From Wilderness to Warfront covers a wide range of topics relating to the war effort, from America's entry into World War II to the experiences of soldiers and nurses in training and on the field to the challenges faced by communities in the Adirondacks and across the United States, and through to the healing and rebuilding that took place after the war. Each of these subjects is illuminated through both objects of national relevance, such as propaganda produced by the government and circulated through the press, and personal effects that capture memories and responses in journal entries and letters. Together, this mix of communal and individual artifacts and ephemera highlight the impact of international and national happenings on people's individual lives, making the exhibition a particularly singular exploration of the way Adirondack communities were affected by the global conflict.</p><p>The exhibition features a selection of stories about individuals from the Adirondacks, including, for</p><p>example, Gladys Hunt (1915-2008) from Indian Lake, who enlisted in the Army Nurse corps in 1943 and served on the frontlines in hospitals in France, Holland, and Germany. After Hunt was honorably discharged in 1946, she enrolled in Pratt Institute, where she focused on designing one of the first truly wheelchair-accessible kitchens, inspired by her work with soldiers who were disabled. Although she received very little credit for her innovations, she was instrumental in furthering modern accessible design. Another example is Clarence Petty (1905-2009) from Coreys near Saranac Lake, who enlisted in 1942 and served as a transport pilot in the Pacific. After the war, he returned to the Adirondacks and put his flying skills to use as a ranger in the NY Department of Environmental Conservation. He became the first person to extinguish a forest fire by dumping water from an airplane, and his outspoken commitment to conservation contributed to the creation of the Adirondack Park Agency. These narratives are just two of the many featured in the show, which also include the important contributions of members of the Mohawk Nation as well as the experiences of refugees who resettled in the Adirondacks following the war.</p><p>\"It was important to us that this exhibition speak to the lived experiences of people from this region. This exhibition is really the first to examine the different ways that the people from the Adirondacks contributed to the war but also shaped life following it, both in this region and well beyond. We're so delighted by the individual histories we've been able to bring to light, and think audiences will be surprised and inspired by the many people that are represented in the exhibition,\" said Laura Rice, ADKX's Chief Curator.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124567059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6337-X271-DYTH-G00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 6, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Wheelchairs</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FCMjhBMjVFMEUwNDg1NDk4QzdCMkM2RDM4MjY1N0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI2RkNERjc3QTRCNEEyRkI5QkQwRTRFMzFBQkUxMjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNK2</classCode><className>DIARY KEEPING &amp; JOURNALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000672</classCode><className>EXHIBITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX579</classCode><className>ALBANY, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A3OI</classCode><className>APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Good morning. My name is Miriam Tuerk. I'm Co-Founder and CEO of Clear Blue Technologies. Just to let everyone know, we will be recording this presentation webinar and uploading it onto our website and distributing it to interested investors. So it will be recorded.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm joined this morning by Farrukh Anwar, our CFO; as well as Ryan Freemantle, our wonderful IR team member from Sophic Capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This morning, we're going to go through an overview of the company from a go-forward perspective, as well as our fiscal 2022 results. Soon as I can get the computer to move the page, I will. Here we go.</p><p>As always as a publicly traded company, please read the forward-looking statements that gives cautionary advice and we're giving the best knowledge that we can. But things can happen as we all know, and you should take that under consideration when making any investment decisions.</p><p>So what we're going to do is give you an update on the company, its products, what we're seeing in the marketplace. And there's been quite a bit of change, so I think it will be an interesting conversation for you this morning. We then going to be going over the fiscal 2022 results and after that, we'll talk about the outlook for 2023, which at this point in time, we are cautiously optimistic that things are in good stead for a good year in 2023.</p><p>So let's start first of all with 2022. And there is really no other word than abysmal when you look at the revenue results for the year. They were contrary to not only our 2021 results, but our 2020 results, our 2019 results, and our 2018 results. And so it is in management's opinion, an anomaly that is not something that is typical for the company. It is such a big delta compared to even four years of previous history. And we spent a lot of time analyzing and thinking about what that could cost could have been, and really the macroeconomic challenges were the key driver of what happened in 2022.</p><p>As a result of that, we had other challenges as a company. We had working capital challenges as you can imagine. We are a company that leads because of our R&amp;D technology. We are leaders in innovation, in power, and what we do, and that requires R&amp;D investment. And so when the revenue dropped, we needed to figure that out. And I think we took some good actions to do that.</p><p>And then it wasn't just us that went through hell and back last year. A lot of our customers -- most of our customers had significant impacts as well. They hang up their capital investments, projects had to be reallocated. And that, of course, they would reach out to us for help and assistance on all of those things.</p><p>So all in all, it has been a tough year. But as we all know, many companies do well when they work through the tough period status when real value and real gems come through. And our job as a company has been to make sure that we take advantage of both the positive and the negative. And so we worked very hard last year to put in place the things we needed to have to make it a launch pad for large and resilient future growth. Albert Einstein, in the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity. And that is clearly what we did.</p><p>So let's talk about what that looks like. And so I think the key thing that everyone needs to understand is that we are today a very different company than we were 15 months ago. On the one hand, we've raised more than $10 million of non-dilutive capital and of that, $6 million is pure R&amp;D grants. That is funding that doesn't come in as a one-time lump sum. It comes in on a monthly and quarterly basis and provides us capital to continue to invest in R&amp;D and maintain our market leadership over the next three years.</p><p>We acquired ePower Systems (sic - \"eSite Power Systems\"). We signed the deal in December and closed it in January, and that's a real game changer for us. I'm going to spend a bit of time talking about eSite Power Systems, but it is a huge -- has a huge change in terms of our product line as well as how we are perceived and positioned within the marketplace as a company.</p><p>We have broadened our product offering quite significantly. January 1, 2022, we basically had two products. We had our Nano-Grid product for telecom, and we had our Illumient streetlights product. As of today and July when we start, we've been -- we start shipping two of the products commercially. We are a five-product company. And so that's a big change in the products we have, which expands our addressable market and expands our use cases and our opportunity for revenue growth.</p><p>Because of the eSite Power acquisition, we've expanded our customer base and we added 35 large and strategic new telecom customers as a result of that acquisition in 25 countries. And these are marquee companies. We're talking about American Tower, Airtel, MTN, Vodacom, Safaricom, [Orange]. And although IHS Towers is a great customer of Clear Blue's, they are also a good customer for eSite Power for the larger systems and retrofits and that has a strategic value to us going forward.</p><p>And then I think the last thing I'd like to say is that as a result of all of the above, we're really moving into the core network and core infrastructure. So on the core network side, larger power AC-driven power hybrid systems and getting -- working with customers to add solar and get off of diesel from a retrofit perspective is now a big part of our conversation. And I think when I say that the acquisition of eSite really changes how the market views Clear Blue, it's clear to the marketplace now that we are a leading sophisticated player in telecom power. Prior to eSite, we were in that business, we were in that market, but with new and innovative technology and applications and not really part of the core.</p><p>Now, we are part of the core. And I've seen in a lot of meetings I've had with customers, there's a bit of a different view, a different conversation happening, and renewed interest in our other products. So if we have eSite and we're doing it in the core, then that same underlying technology is in Nano-Grid, so it's telecom-grade equipment.</p><p>On the Illumient business and you're going to see I start to talk a lot more about Illumient and our North American business than we have in the past. And the reason for that is there's been a market change in sales, in orders, in demand, and in the market. This is finely generated by the clean air and infrastructure acts in the US and the budgets in Canada have been announced.</p><p>And I think the key thing is that the market seems to have been ready. So there's been other incentives in the past, but now we're seeing major infrastructure projects as a result. And so to be able to talk about the fact that for O'Hare Airport in Chicago, we're part of an airport runway extension project. And in the American midwest, we're doing an interstate highway interchange. These are different projects than what we have traditionally done. And they're larger, they're more mission-critical infrastructure, they're bigger spending, and our expanded product basis is helping us to win those businesses.</p><p>So when we look at our product line, you will see that it has expanded significantly. First of all, through the acquisition of eSite Power Systems, a Swedish company, we have now taken that technology and we are blending it with Clear Blue's IP from Illumient's cloud management service perspective. Our business model, our unique IP is being added to that product.</p><p>And so we now call it Esite-Micro. And as you can see, that expand our use cases from the Nano-Grid business, which really took you up to about 3 kilowatts, up to well over 30 kilowatts of power from an Esite-Micro perspective. So whereas no projects or revenue for those types of systems were in our numbers for 2022. Even starting in Q1, we have revenue for Esite-Micro in our results.</p><p>Additionally, you know that we've announced the Pico-Grid product. It's been a big focus of our R&amp;D investment as a company, and it starts to ship commercially in Q2. So you start to see the impact of Pico-Grid revenue and volume sales in our numbers in the back half of this year. I will caution everyone, it will be small numbers this year, but we expect the volume to scale quite significantly. And our plan and our hope is that it will have a material line item in our revenue for 2024.</p><p>On the Illumient side, we've also worked on new product introduction. And our traditional product prior to January 1 of last year was our STRADA Series. We launched the CAMMI Series, which is really a lithium version of our STRADA Series, I think in Q2 of last year. And one of our large booking orders for that interstate highway is the CAMMI product. So we started to see results already in the orders. As you would know, there's easily a nine- to 12-month lead time on orders. So we launched in Q2 and voila, an order already in hand in Q1 of this year.</p><p>And we are launching our new SENTI product, which I'll speak more about in a minute. And I just want to make a comment that SENTI built off of Pico-Grid. So it's the same power, smart power electronics inside, but two different versions of product from a go-to-market perspective.</p><p>And so when you look at the two product lines, you can see that we've added Esite-Micro, we've added Pico-Grid, we added CAMMI last year, and we are now adding SENTI. And so the portfolio of products the company has is quite expanded.</p><p>Let me just spend a few minutes on Pico-Grid and on SENTI. And it's really a definition and an example of the innovation Clear Blue brings to the marketplace. So when you're looking at Internet of Things devices, a lot of those systems are very small power devices. We're talking about security cameras that draft 3 watts. But they're still very mission critical. And the market needed a very small and low-cost simple system in order to provide reliable power.</p><p>And so our Pico-Grid product is an all-in-one product. It's got energy storage inside of it as well as the power electronics. So instead of someone having to go out and buy the batteries and buy a charger and then buy some DC/DC converters and have five or six little pieces put together and have quite a bit of a mess, we have designed and built a single all-in-one simple system. Very low cost, very targeted for specific use case, quite a lot of sophistication in terms of the control and management of the loads, which is very much needed for this use case; as well as an ability to support a myriad of different devices from a power perspective.</p><p>And so you have a company that's got five or six little things that they have to put together and it might cost about $2,000 to get rid of all of that. And in one 12-inch box, you get Pico-Grid and it's replacing that.</p><p>On the SENTI side, if you drive around, you have probably seen a fair number of all-in-one solar streetlights. And basically what they are, it's a light on the bottom and a solar panel on the top, plucked together, so it's kind of an all in one. There were a lot of challenges unless you're right underneath the equator. Those all-in-one streetlights were sub performance for a number of reasons.</p><p>And so one of the reasons Clear Blue had not come out with an all-in-one solar streetlight was because the technology performance was not there. They were basically garden lights and you've heard me talk a lot about garden lights. We don't do garden lights. We came to a point where because of the performance of Pico-Grid -- so Pico-Grid is inside of SENTI. Because of the performance of Pico-Grid, because of the advancements in LED lighting -- and we now have our own LED light engineer on board, and because of an innovative patent around this [streetlight], we now have an ability to deliver an all-in-one street light that is probably three to four times the performance of other products in the marketplace.</p><p>And it will work in Toronto, and it'll work in South America. It doesn't just have to be under the equator. So it can be slanted to face the sun. You can put the light any direction you want. You don't have to try to line it up. And it sells for a manufacturer, so it just reels of price around USD1,200. And there's no wiring, no separate batteries. Again, everything is built inside. So these products begin shipping in late Q2 and we do expect both of them, our plan and our target is that these will scale to thousands and thousands of systems that will ship.</p><p>Now, I want to talk a little bit about eSite. So as you know, eSite is a Swedish company, and I'm very proud to talk about Swedish hardware engineering and quality and software that's sitting on that hardware. It is a strong industry brand recognition and strong respect in the industry. They've been around since I think 2008 with their products in the marketplace. A marquee customer list of customers that they have.</p><p>And it's interesting to understand that it's quite unique, if you are a power person, you're not used to seeing this outside compartment. And the reason it is there is that in this specifically engineered for harsh non-air-conditioned environment. So if you are a telecom company and you are spending thousands of dollars a month on diesel gas because the grid is not there or not reliable, getting off of diesel and reducing that is both a green initiative as well as a huge cost problem.</p><p>In the last year in Nigeria, for example, people will talk about the cost of diesel going from $200 to $670. So we're talking about over three times the price increase. The only way to get off of diesel and go green is to be non-air-conditioned, to have passive cooling. And the only way to do that is what Esite-Micro has.</p><p>So there was a very specific reason why we were interested in the company. And their technology and engineering of what they have built in this product is a leading in the industry just from a hardware perspective. When you take that and you merge it with our Smart Power management platform, which we are adding and integrating with eSite -- every eSite system we sell, and ship today ships with our recurring-revenue Illumience management platform and our service solution.</p><p>That implementation integration is ongoing. But every customer from day one that we close the business has asked for that. And we have an imminent order that we were hoping to get in short order where the customer is buying some new eSite systems. We've now included our Illumience. And they've come to us and said, can we take all of our 100 systems we previously purchased from eSite and add the Illumience platform and service to that.</p><p>We've also added the fact that we are now selling full systems solutions to the marketplace. So we don't just sell the power electronics, we engineer the energy and the power of the system for our customers. And we provide an industry-leading service model. So customers don't just get the hardware and then they have to figure it out; they get our ongoing support and there's strong demand and acceptance for that.</p><p>So when you put those two things together, when I sit down and I have a conversation with the senior executive of large telcos and towercos, really where we are is we're on the road to zero diesel. And customers are saying to us, well, how can you go to zero diesel. We're never going to get rid of all of the diesel generators. These are small footprint, existing sites. There's shading of the tower on solar panels. And it's a very interesting story.</p><p>So let me just go back to what our core technology is and what it is that we do. So Clear Blue's core technology is our smart off-grid management capability. That is embedded in our hardware out in the field. So Clear Blue's Nano-Grid, Pico-Grid, Illumient, SENTI, all has smart power electronics with edge computing in it. And the wonderful thing about eSite is their hardware has that edge computing capacity as well. And so the ability to add Illumience into the eSite system is a perfect synergistic opportunity.</p><p>Every single system in the field communicates wirelessly with our cloud platform. And through our cloud platform, we deliver unparalleled maximum uptime, long system life, and we handle all the installation maintenance nightmares, and they are quite challenging in the field. How do we do that? Well, we do energy forecasting and management. So we have the weather. We look at the energy profile of the site. We look at what's happening to the site. We get early warning indicators and predictors to help us manage the energy of the site and keep it up even through extreme situations or maintenance events.</p><p>One of the things that a lot of people don't realize is that when a site goes down and there's a problem, it can take days to repair a maintenance situation. And we have a unique ability to deliver service through a maintenance event, unlike any other company in the marketplace. We also have fantastic troubleshooting and remediation tools, the ability to look for problems that are coming or starting to have an issue long before the site has to go into emergency mode and the doctors have to get out there and make sure everything's working perfectly in an emergency way.</p><p>So customers benefit from our intelligent management. We manage through the rainy period. We manage through storms. We manage through degraded sites; someone broker solar panel, or something wasn't connected properly. And we also deliver to our customers more energy than they are actually have acquired or paid for. So we have one customer, as an example, who's consuming 50% more power than the site was actually engineered for. And most of the time, that's okay. And that's as a result of our energy and weather forecasting. So we're able to over exceed our performance capacity for a very big chunk of the year even though the site was not engineered for it.</p><p>Battery life cycle management, energy storage, how much you have, how much you have on an ongoing basis, how you charge and discharge those batteries and make sure that they're healthy, is the key to every business case and business model. There are really two big issues when you're looking at deploying power infrastructure. One is what is the upfront CapEx. And we have a better capability to deliver 40% lower upfront CapEx than anybody else in the marketplace. But also making sure that the batteries and the energy system lasts a long time; these last five years, and these last 10 years, and how to make sure that happens.</p><p>So I was listening to CNBC last night and they were talking about pixie dust of the word AI. And different companies are using the word AI, and so people are getting a stock tick forward or not. So I'm a little bit cautious about talking about this. And so it's a big word and I want to be very clear, Clear Blue does not, today, have any AI.</p><p>But if you look at this Gartner graph, when you are on the move towards artificial intelligence and that you start down a path where first, you've got to have the data. You've got to know what happened and how things happen. You have to have descriptive analytics. You have lots of data. We are the only company that has thousands of systems in tens and tens of countries that are sending data to an integrated cloud data platform in the marketplace. There's no other company in the world that is doing that for power systems, for telecom, and smart city, and hybrid off-grid systems.</p><p>We have already done the data and the big data. Analytics is something we've been doing for many years and over the last few years, we've been moving into predictive analytics. So we can now predict certain issues and problems and see when there's going to be a problem in the future.</p><p>The next step on that path is to start to automate at scale and then say, use that data to teach the system, to get the machine to learn, to then start to have their own insight. And Clear Blue's $5-million grant from SDTC, the Canadian government, that we won and started drawing money down in December of last year is about our plan to add the checkmark to the fifth item here. And it's going to take us a few years to do that, but we are already very far down the path.</p><p>And other companies -- unless you're a Microsoft or a Google where you have all that data. But if you're a power infrastructure company in our market, you got to start at the beginning. You've got to start with data, then you got to get the big data, then you got to go to analytics, predictive analytics. So we're on a journey. We don't do AI technically, but we've got a lot of the building blocks and we're going there.</p><p>So what does that look like for our customers? The conversation we're having with our customer is that what we're doing with R&amp;D -- and we're not there today and we can't guarantee everything, but here's where we're going and what we're trying to do. First of all, we want to lower your CapEx. That we've proven to the marketplace. And it's been independently validated by Meta Facebook and Telef\u00c3\u00b3nica telco in South America who did a field study in 2021, produced their own independent report. Yes, Clear Blue's Smart Off-Grid power requires 40% lower upfront CapEx than other customer -- other competitive systems. So we check marked on that one.</p><p>The next step is how do we get to zero diesel? How do we eliminate massive quantities of diesel? And we're not going to do it on every site. Yes, we'll add solar, and every site will require less diesel. But if we can get to a point where using predictive analytics and machine learning and optimization, we can increase the performance of solar, we can optimize for shading; we can use machine learning dynamics to say, hey, this grid over here with this power consumption of that site in this location and that solar, you know what? 20% to 50% of your site, you can actually turn the diesel generator off.</p><p>Reducing maintenance windows by 50%. Knowing ahead of time when there's a problem. Improving uptime availability. And at the end of the day, what we want to do is we want to walk into a towerco and say, our technology has 5% to 10% margin to the bottom line. You take our acquisition of eSite to take us into that retrofit business where all of a sudden, diesel is a blend. Remember that Clear Blue's technology did not support a hybrid diesel site. With the addition of eSite, we now have a much stronger AC support for a hybrid diesel systems. And you put all of that together, and we are at a point where we have momentum to move forward and deliver for our customers some significant value with a wide range of products in the marketplace.</p><p>So hopefully that was informative. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I could dive in for hours on it, but I wanted to kind of give you a high-level overview of that. Now, we're going to go into our 2022 results.</p><p>So there's only one word for it. I'm going to be very blunt. Our 2022 revenue topline result was abysmal. It was way lower than we could ever have anticipated, and we hit the year quite strong. We expected that our trend in growth would continue from our previous years. We had orders and customers and bookings and everything and momentum to move forward. And then the war and the interest rates and China still being closed and still shortages on parts -- people remember now there is no shortages in parts now less than there was, but it definitely impacted.</p><p>And so at the end of the day, really starting in Q2, project cancellations, project deferral, project delay. And when CapEx spending gets delayed, our projects are part of that, and things got kicked forward. So our results for the year were impacted. We were down 68% from the previous year. And our Q4 was particularly low, I will say. And if I could have [had time], I would have done it. We did have to reverse out two transactions of two customers who are very good relationship of ours because they didn't get their financing and things were unable to move forward. It was originally thought they would move forward pretty well. But by the time we got into early Q1 of this year, they had to be reversed out. So that's why December is so low.</p><p>At this point, I'm going to turn it over to Farrukh to give you some updates on our financials in detail. Farrukh, do you want to take it from here?</p><p>FARRUKH ANWAR, CFO, CLEAR BLUE TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL INC.: Yeah, for sure. And thank you so much, Miriam. Hello, everyone. So has been pointed out, our overall revenue has been down compared to prior year. However, we see some interesting trends shaping up. Clear Blue's lighting vertical is made up of one-time revenue and energy-as-a-service deferred revenue. As the company continues to grow its energy-as-a-service offerings, we have seen a gradual decrease in one-time lighting revenue and corresponding increase in the energy-as-a-service recurring revenue. The 37% decrease in lighting revenue is impacted by the same shift with revenues to be generated over the next three years.</p><p>Decrease in US revenues is also likely impacted by the company's -- it's basically likely impacted by the shift and also by project delays waiting on infrastructure and Clean Air Act, which are now in place, resulting in a big change in future outlook for our lighting business.</p><p>On the telecom side, our business had been growing consistently over the past few years. However, for the first time, we can see that there's a decline in this vertical during the current year. As Miriam pointed out, and rightfully so, the decrease is mainly attributable to the global supply chain issues, which we can see that's affecting the telecom rollout of different customers of ours, and projects have been delayed to 2023, resulting in a decrease in revenue for the quarter and trailing four quarters of 2022.</p><p>Customers also delayed their CapEx expenditure in 2020, which caused project deferrals. So we can see a decrease in our Middle East and Africa segment, which can be mainly attributed to this. Although, we still continue to have a good relationship with these customers and are working with them to accommodate them to -- so that we can work on their device rollout schedule with them.</p><p>Next slide, Miriam.</p><p>Okay. So as we said in the previous slides, our recurring revenue is the revenue that the company earns from its energy-as-a-service, Illumience ongoing management service, and cloud service. So the three main areas where we get the energy-as-a-service, that's Illumience ongoing management services, the cloud services, and energy-as-a-service.</p><p>So every single system that Clear Blue has ever sold includes an ongoing service component. Clear Blue manages and operates the power systems on an ongoing basis for our customers. And this is at the heart of our business and our value proposition. As telecom customers increased wireless communication bandwidth to support the ever-growing customer base. So to do the power needs of those sites also increase, and that's why it helps us in our recurring revenue.</p><p>This ongoing growth of telecom systems and the ongoing operations and maintenance of power needed to keep these systems functioning is what drives the growth in our recurring revenue. As you can see, addition of our telecom customer rollouts over the years have a nice impact upon the growth of our recurring revenue.</p><p>For the trailing four quarters, recurring revenue grew 83% to $819,000. For Q4, revenue was $116,689 (sic - see MD&amp;A Q4 2022, \"$166,889\"), which is around 112% from the same period last year.</p><p>Miriam, do you want to speak about bookings?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So bookings were actually up compared to the previous year, just under $2 million in bookings. And just as a reminder, our bookings include two components, one is customers prepay their Illumience deferred revenue services. And as a result of that, we have that as a deferred revenue line item and it's prepaid. So it's bookings that we will realize the revenue is in the future.</p><p>The second is when we have orders that we've received but have not yet shipped and when the portions of the orders that are deferred revenue only convert from purchase order to deferred revenue once it has shipped. So as a result of that, at the end of last year, we were just under $2 million, which is up from the previous year. And we do expect that this is going to grow nicely when we are able to announce our Q1 results. One of the great news is that bookings jumped quite nicely in Q1.</p><p>FARRUKH ANWAR: Thank you, Miriam.</p><p>So if we look at the graph on the right, we see the company has been able to grow its margin over the years. And now, it's maintaining margins at the mid-30 range. With high inflation and increasing commodity prices, there has been pressure on the company's margin. However, in most cases, we've managed to either innovate lower costs elsewhere or pass a portion of these incurred cost of materials to its customers.</p><p>So trailing-four-quarter margin increased to 37%, up from a margin of 28% in 2021. I will include, in trailing-four-quarter 2022 was the one-time -- I mean trailing-four-quarter 2021, so that comparative was a one-time low margin deal of -- for our customer. And if you exclude that impact of that one-time deal, so our margin comparison is 37% compared to 29.7% year to date for 2021. So I'm pretty happy about the margins that we've been able to generate on our products.</p><p>However, given that we acquired eSite this year and the company does expect a little bit lower gross margin in 2023 while we undertake work to improve the margins for the business. However, it is still expected to be around the 30% range -- 30%, 32% around that range. Next page, Miriam.</p><p>So some of our operating expenses. In this environment of high inflation and resulting higher costs, Clear Blue's management is focused on reducing operating expenses where possible. You can see that in Q4, operating expenses decreased by 4% compared to the same period in 2021. However, the company continues to invest heavily in R&amp;D projects. And as Miriam pointed out earlier, our product offering has grown over the last year. And now, we have a wide range of products to meet varying customer needs.</p><p>Some of these projects have been put into use this year. And therefore, the company has started amortizing intangibles related to completed R&amp;D projects. And this amounted to around $355,000. The company also continued to spend on non-project related R&amp;D. And during the year, mainly cloud and software costs were up by approximately $175,000. The remaining variance in operating expenses for the year is due to some allowance for debt that we had to make of around $343,000.</p><p>So we did have our travel and related expenses increased by around $280,000 due to the company's participation in various customer meetings, meetings with other customers as well, and investor-related events, whereas travel was restricted in the comparative periods of 2021. The increase was offset, however, by lower share-based compensation of $343,000 compared to the comparative period of 2021. And the management team provided the company salary relief of around $323,000 in 2022 by agreeing to forgo a portion of the remuneration owed as of December 31, as well as reducing their salaries.</p><p>So all in all, adjusted EBITDA. If you look at our adjusted EBITDA, loss has increased by nearly 3% for the quarter and 47% on a trailing-four-quarter basis. The increase can be attributable to reduced margins resulted from reduced revenue.</p><p>Thank you so much. Miriam, do you want to take it from here?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So 2022 is now behind us. We had, as I said before, abysmal revenue results. I do want to comment, we really looked very hard inwardly around whether or not we could in fact confirm that it was impacted by macroenvironment. We don't just say that in lib way. As many of you will know, management put in a fair amount of money and took a fair amount of salary reductions, et cetera, et cetera, off of the table. And the main reason for that was because of a ruthless analysis to say, does the dog hunt? Is the business good? And why is this happening?</p><p>And the roundabout conclusion, both in consulting with external and getting our independent board members, the kind of make sure we're not seeing through rose-colored glasses is that we really do believe it was by the macroenvironment.</p><p>Couple of things that need to happen once the numbers start to come back up is you got to still make money and contribution margin, and the fact that we've been able to grow our margins is a good positive. I talked for many years about growing our recurring revenue and it wasn't moving. It is now moving and we're very happy about that.</p><p>Making sure that we can go after a wider breadth of the product, getting share of wallet from the customer by having a wide range of products is key. And so growing our product portfolio from two products to five was a strong aspect. The acquisition of Esite-Micro, both from a product perspective and a customer perspective, it's a huge game changer for us. And getting access to $10 million of non-dilutive funding, of which $6 million is a grant. The other $4 million is a 0% interest 10-year loan that injects cash to us over the next three years to allow us to maintain our leadership from an R&amp;D perspective.</p><p>Okay. Let's talk about going forward as the last time I have to talk about 2022. Sales is okay. The whole company, hugely busy right now. Scaling, scaling, scaling and very, very active. In terms of our key sales activity in 2023, our Illumient North American business is seeing strong sales momentum and making sure that that continues, that we capitalize on that, that we monetize that is a key focus and area of activity.</p><p>Our Esite-Micro is powering the greening of existing retrofit and large telecom systems. So there are a number of large strategic customers who have already announced, like I just did, $140 million spending program to convert every one of their existing large telecom sites to solar hybrid. And Esite-Micro together with Clear Blue is working hard to be positioned to get a very large chunk of that business. That's heavy activity this year.</p><p>We have Nano-Grid rollouts continuing and expanding. We are expecting a number of follow-on orders and we've got new projects. We announced our e-learning Avanti partnership last year. I think we're going to start to see some revenue from that initiative landing this year, hopefully, and grow beyond that. The launch of SENTI in North America is kind of require some focus and we are moving quickly to make sure we capitalize that.</p><p>And then for Pico-Grid, Pico-Grid is going to be -- could be thousands of systems. We're talking about a device that -- for those of you who have a new Starlink modem, for every one of those Starlink modem, you'd have a Pico-Grid shipping with it. And so we're talking about the follow-on being thousands and thousands of systems. The way that's going to happen is small rollout projects will happen as companies scale that. And so we expect to see small rollout projects this year readying for the larger volume deployments in 2024. Those are the key areas of activity and focus from a sales and business development that the company is working on right now.</p><p>So when you look for catalysts, what's going to validate that we are on that new traction? I think as you'll see on the next slide, if I look at the year-to-date results of where we are from a performance perspective, we're on track to doing what we want to do this year, showing that 2022 was an anomaly and that we're going to grow from 2021's numbers. Still early in the year. So we have to prove that out.</p><p>How are we going to know? Well, we got to see that North American sales growth driven by all three new products. Esite-Micro sales in the retrofit, market winning those deals is key. Converting the rest of our $300 million pipeline to revenue. Demonstrating cash flow breakeven. We're very focused on cash and positive EBITDA. And we get there around $2-plus million in quarterly revenue. So as soon as we can show that for a few quarters now, you start to see up, they're on track to positive EBITDA, zero cash burn for this year. And of course, we want to show that 50%-plus growth rate.</p><p>Beyond that, we're going to continue to do strong organic growth of our topline. There are additional M&amp;A opportunities. 2023 will prove out the success of our model, of an acquisition helping to help with organic growth through Esite-Micro, and we'll then look at some others. And I put all of that together, we want to have a demonstrated, established track record of consistent EBITDA growth for the company.</p><p>So in closing out our formal presentation, we're just about to open it up to questions. Our 2023 target plan. Everything this company is working towards is focused on achieving positive EBITDA and net-zero cash burn. And as you know, Q1 is always soft. It's soft because really anything that shifts in Q1 is Q4 purchase orders. So you have to be looking at last November or think, how was the market to really see what we were going to do in Q1 from a revenue perspective.</p><p>So it's traditionally always been low revenue and it's going to be it for Q1. But -- and this is the piece that helps us to reconfirm that it wasn't a normal year, our sales activity has started off quite strong across multiple businesses. So we have more than 3.5 million orders at the end of Q1, and we expect of that, 3.2 million to ship in the middle of this year. And the good news is it's equally split. A third, a third, a third across Illumient, Nano-Grid, and Esite-Micro. So it's not just like a one big deal from this customer or that. It's multiple orders, always big orders, good margin, et cetera, et cetera, growing nicely.</p><p>And so our year-to-date performance is indicative that we can meet our target. We just need to make sure that that momentum continues more than just year-to-date April in order to demonstrate the results for the year. And as it sits right now, as I said at the beginning of this presentation, management of Clear Blue is cautiously optimistic.</p><p>So I thank you for your time and your support and this presentation. Ryan, do you want to throw some questions at us that people have sent in?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE, IR, SOPHIC CAPITAL INC.: Yes. Thank you, Miriam. As mentioned at the beginning of the call, my name is Ryan Fremantle, and I work for Sophic Capital. We help out Clear Blue with their investor relations. I'm going to be your moderator for the Q&amp;A session. So with that said, let's begin. We've collected questions via email beforehand and from those of you that are on the call today. And just a quick reminder that you may continue to ask questions via the chat function or feel free to send an email with questions to either <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investors@clearbluetechnologies.com\">investors@clearbluetechnologies.com</email> or myself, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ryan@sophiccapital.com\">ryan@sophiccapital.com</email></p><p>Okay. Miriam, let's start off with a few product-related questions. So the Micro product, what percentage of integration will occur this year for CBL that use IP into micro? And when do you expect full integration?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So there's three phases to the integration. The first -- okay, so there's four phases to the integration. Integration number one was day one we began providing the service management function. So eSite previously was just shipping hardware and the customer was on their own. Day one of closing the deal, our service team became the support resource for customers. So rollout of systems, installation of systems, troubleshooting of systems, and we're working with customer on optimization from a service; we started day one.</p><p>There are two active accounts, one of which is one of the biggest ones who were a little bit vibrating. They were struggling. And our team and our people on the ground in Africa, we started at day one. So that's done and is already happening.</p><p>Step two is what I will call the simple integration into Clear Blue Illumience platform. I don't have fine timelines. We're still learning, and it's also dependent upon customer need, et cetera, that our expected timeline for that is in Q3. If I needed to accelerate it, I could probably do it in a couple of months. There's already work ongoing, but it will be juggled according to other revenue-driven demands and needs of the marketplace. But sometime in Q3, that's step two.</p><p>Step three is full integration with Illumience's current functionality. I would say that's another three to six months. So it could be there in Q4 or in Q1, again, based upon customer demand and what they need. And then the last piece, which will be an ongoing thing in our AI program and everything else is now that you've added diesel to the mix and you're dealing with it much more hybrid systems rather than solar only, there will be new and innovative IP. So adding that new level of functionality that we don't have today that specific to those use cases will be something that will be an ongoing roadmap for the company.</p><p>As I said to some of the senior executives of some of our customers, we are on the road to zero diesels. And how we get there through machine learning, it has a material impact for them. And there's a lot of quote-unquote learning from the machine to do that. But that will start next year. So our program around machine learning and AI is going to heavily include that, and that is just starting from a planning perspective. But I would think that that is something that we will file a number of patents and really grow our leadership in the market on.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Again, the Esite-Micro product. Is there an application for construction companies? For example, ATCO who manufactures prefabricated structures, which does include temporary facilities that often are in harsh deployments with no access or comparatively no access to [expensive] power.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So this starts to get into anybody who wants to watch some of the Tesla wars, et cetera, et cetera. Power has made up the AC world and the DC world. Our products are primarily focused on the DC world. So DC current and some of the AC current you have in your house, DC is what powers anything electronic. So if it's an LED light or a computer or it's got any sort of processor of any brains, any processor, those circuits in your computer are DC powered. Clear Blue's products are mostly focused on DC. We can support AC, but most [DC-focused].</p><p>So the answer is yes, but not every use case. If somebody wants -- they have a construction. And I can remember when I worked on a construction site for one of my work when I was on one of those mobile trailers and we walked in and he had an office in the coffee machine, and that's where the foremen worked. And if you need a generator or start a system to power that AC trailer, that's probably not us. But if you're talking about mining and construction, and oil and gas, and monitoring and machine, those kinds of things, there's a lot of use cases for that. By the way, we have contracts and projects with ATCO. And Albert is a bit of investing in green. The energy industry is greening itself, and so we already have them as a customer and are thrilled to support them.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Switching to the SENTI product. Can you elaborate any priority, the markets you identified for this product?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So the SENTI product is -- so if you look at the traditional streetlight that we had been selling previously, it was big, it was heavy. It required a crane and concrete foundation, et cetera, et cetera. And if you think of yourself like I -- if you've ever been to Muskoka and you drive to the Muskoka hotel there and you're driving up the roadway and they've got kind of nice little accent lighting for roadways and parkways, et cetera, et cetera. Those kind of smaller lights never, never made any delta. So parks, roadways, landscape areas, private property, non-roadway applications, the bigger lights didn't make sense.</p><p>So SENTI, because LEDs have gone from 80 lumens per watt to 170 lumens per watt. Because of Pico-Grids, a Clear Blue's -- I understand that we're using lithium cells. We're not using a battery. We [duct the] cells and we've made the electronics with the functionality. We've optimized it for high performance, high efficiency. And because solar panels are efficient, you can get a reasonably small power. Put that all together.</p><p>And SENTI light is really applicable -- think of it as anything where you would walk through a streetlight or pathway light that's 15- to 20-foot pole. And the beauty is this thing is going to ship in a box. And when you get it and you take it out, there's actually no wires, no connections. It's just a mechanical mount. You can buy one of these things, screw it to the wall of your cottage. And it's not a cottage application, but I'm just trying to say that a non-technical, easy to install. Just take it out of the box, you plug it -- you screw it, you mount it somewhere and away you go.</p><p>We anticipate that we are going to have significant volumes across the southern US and the western US, as well as in the northeast, mostly because it's easy to ship. Our current products are heavy to ship. We're talking about truckloads of poles. And so it's not very often that our agent partners are going to make the pull in Burlington and ship it to LA. But with SENTI, we've got a wider addressable market.</p><p>North America is our primary focus. And we have thought to launch only in North America. Though we've actually seen a significant demand in Africa for private, not public. For infrastructure, but gated communities, a mining construction, industrial complexes, significant demand from some of our partners. So for now, we're in focus in North America and we'll start again in Africa because we have distribution channels.</p><p>SENTI is a lithium product. You're not going to put it in [Fort McMurray]. It's too cold.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: How does SENTI cost $2,100 per light compared to traditional non-LED wired streetlights and how much does the traditional street light costs?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So a traditional -- so first of all, streetlights are like dining room chandeliers. You can spend $20, or you can spend $10,000. So you just have to know that that's the whole thing. So you can't just compare it.</p><p>But you can buy a street light light like that probably for $300, then you have to add a termination breaker -- like a termination box with a plug and termination point. You have to have fuses. You've got to wire it down the pole. You got to have a termination point. You've got to send it through the ground, over to a breaker panel and the distribution panel. Then you've got to have a meter connecting it to the grid. And the general rule of thumb is $200 for meter cost of cable [conversion].</p><p>So if you're putting these things 30 feet apart and it's a new construction built, it is way cheaper to go solar off-grid. And what I think is interesting is in Q4, when we were doing a bit of a roadshow with the lightning agents. Five years ago, all anybody wanted to talk about was the conversion of regular streetlights to LED lights. There was a massive redeployment of LED lights across America, where everybody retrofitted all their old high-pressure sodium streetlights with LED streetlights.</p><p>What the agents told us is the number one question when they walk into the room now is what do you got for solar products? So it's starting to be solar first. And that's why I talked about O'Hare Airport runway extension program -- a runway extension project, and their solar streetlights. New interstate highway in the American west, in the interchange on-ramp solar streetlights.</p><p>And we're starting to see that more and more. We're seeing towns and municipalities doing entire infrastructures solar only. There is an understanding that it's reliable and it works. The technology is there. There is an understanding that it's more resilient. They don't have to deal with all the climate change issues that destroy infrastructure. If you have a forest fire across the highway, it burns the whole cable and you've just lost the whole street light line.</p><p>But I think lastly, anybody who goes out and buys a streetlight or outdoor lighting, not streetlight, but roadway or landscaping, and parking lot -- industrial complex. Anybody who buys that, it gets taken or turnover in the power utility manages those systems. And so when I'm in the city of Hamilton and I decide to do a new subdivision and I put streetlights in, at the end of the construction project, I'll turn those lights over to the Hamilton Hydro. I am not in the power management business.</p><p>If I decide to go with solar streetlights, I'm not deciding to get into the street light power management business, I'm deciding to go with solar streetlights. So one of Clear Blue's key differentiators is we're that power management utility. So when we talk to the customer, we say , well, if you go with the grid, you're going to turn it over to Hamilton Hydro. And if you go with the solar system, Clear Blue's going to manage it for you.</p><p>And that is the key thing because I mean, I don't know how many of you have ever looked at doing power systems in your house. But you just -- I'd love to be able to call Toronto Hydro and say, okay, I need you to connect my house to the grid -- I need power. Checkmark here, connect to the grid or solar off-grid or hybrid. And that's not what happens. What happens is Toronto Hydro provides the grid, and then the rest, I have to manage myself. And that's the big piece that Clear Blue is solving.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Let's change gears here. Can you give us a bit more color on how 2022 played out from a revenue perspective?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Well, there was none. (laughter) I'm sorry. A little bit more color. So what happened was, we have customers or partners who have ongoing product roadmap -- rollout programs and they are planning on moving out CapEx and doing rollouts, et cetera, et cetera. And if I looked at the beginning of the year compared to what actually happened, two things happened. That rollout of for 1,000 systems suddenly became a rollout of 50 or 100. We're just going to slow down a little bit. Not sure what's happening in the market. A little bit uncertain here. We're just going to buy it in smaller chunks. That's the first thing that happened.</p><p>And then the second thing that happened was we actually have reversals. And we have non-cancellable purchase orders. So there isn't like people can return the equipment. But if you have a really big, good strategic partner who's got a multiyear program with you and they pick up the phone and say, hey, I need a favor, you have to work with them and you want to keep them doing well. You want them to succeed going forward. And if you can redeploy the technology, you kind of got to do that.</p><p>And so we actually had the reverse out a couple of deals last year and had one order, which was $2 million -- no two orders which was $2.1 million where we actually sent a pro forma invoice. We had done the shipping coal. We had just done the 25 steps that you needed to do just before you got the purchase order and the deposit. And with phone call and said, companies just doing a big downsizing. We wanted to throw all of our CapEx recovering budgets. We're pushing it out a year. That's what happened to our revenue last year.</p><p>Some of those have now come in now, and we're seeing them coming in now and rolling out. Some people want to catch up. I mean, they still have their five-year plans or 10-year plans that they've announced to the marketplace or their internal commitments to their own vendors. And so there's keen desire to catch up.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Okay. With $10 million in undiluted capital, $6 million of that for R&amp;D. What does the release schedule in terms, if any, of the remaining $4 million?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So we have about $7 million left. It breaks into three components: the FedDev, there's around $2 million left at the beginning of this year, and that drawdown is expected to happen between the beginning -- January 1, 2023, and the end of March of 2024. So over 15 months. We successfully closed an IRAP grant in Q1 of this year of $750,000. That was new funding that we got after the end of last year. And we are always continuing to look for assistance and support in our R&amp;D investments and so the Canadian government granted us $750,00 from IRAP. And that one runs to the end of March of next year. So the bulk of it will be -- we drew down some in Q1 and the bulk of it will be the next three, four quarters. So it's Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q1.</p><p>And then the SDTC $5 million grant comes over three years. We expect $1.2 million in May. We've already gotten $600,00 -- $550,000 in December, $1.2 million in May, and then there'll be an additional drawdown starting January of next year going forward. So it's in chunks over a three-year plan.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Can you comment on a low stock price given management's positive outlook?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: I mean, my personal opinion -- so I'm not an expert when it comes to the stock market. But when I've looked at our history, we hit a low point at around -- I can't remember if it is $0.08 or $0.09. And then when the market moved and we were doing positive on our results, the stock went up to, I believe, $0.65, $0.68. I think the market is still fairly negative. Investors are still sitting on the side, still very conservative. I'm hopeful. I have people telling me that they think that that bearishness is now going to start to translate to people coming back into the market later this year in the fall.</p><p>And I think, it definitely reflects the fact that last year was a bad year. As we start to announce our Q1 results, which will be soft on the revenue side, but I think -- I know we'll show strong bookings numbers. Q2 results, Q3 results, we start to show that we're back up at the numbers that we used to be at and on a trajectory to growing, that we're positive EBITDA; and that we don't need to do a raise, which is a huge focus of us this year as a company .</p><p>Then I think that together with the market response, it should come back up nicely and could come up very strongly in the fall. So when we went from $0.08 to $0.65 in period of two months, that is the way the market moves as a small-cap company. And it will do so again.</p><p>As our revenue grows and our profitability grows and you go out a year or two, I don't know -- I'm not giving you a forecast, but we will grow out of that ultra-small microcap into the kind of small, medium microcap. We'll get to consistent positive cash flow, generating real meaningful cash. We'll get to good topline growth. We'll do M&amp;A. And I think that we'll grow ourselves into a next category, ultimately moving from the TSXV to the TSX. And then the up-and-down bakery will be much less than what it is right now.</p><p>It's a huge buying opportunity for the company, investors, and for our employees. And I'm very happy for people to buy in now and have a very positive result either to average down for those who have already invested or to just come in.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Thank you. The next set of questions is going to look towards Q1 and the remainder of 2023. So even though Clear Blue is not giving forward guidance at the moment, how should we think about Q1?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So just to iterate, we have started to give guidance when the company was expected to be north of $10 million in revenue and we had good consistent flow and forecast. Obviously, there was a material change in the marketplace last year. And therefore, we're not comfortable -- we shouldn't. Even if everything was 100% from a Clear Blue perspective, just the macroenvironment says, customers is better to be conservative when giving guidance.</p><p>Our Q1 revenue has traditionally -- if you go back and look at our charts, it's always very small because it's that Q4 order that shipped in Q1 before people budgets -- it's the still left over from the previous year or the budgets don't come in until -- really, we see the purchasing for this year against this year's budget starting in February, March with purchase orders.</p><p>So revenue will be soft. Our bookings number is quite strong, up quite significantly from last year. I don't have the final numbers in because I've got to include the Illumience pieces in that that I believe are up more than 50%. And that momentum has continued in April. So where we're at is to -- we're working very hard to have a Q2, Q3 that delivers that $2-million-plus revenue and delivers the positive EBITDA results that we will demonstrate positive cash flow. And at this point, as I said, cautiously optimistic that that's what's going to come to fruition.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: How should we think about Clear Blue's balance sheet? I know you mentioned you will not need to raise capital in 2023.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So Clear Blue's balance sheet, when you just look at it from -- you think, wow, there's a little bit of debt there, and there is. But when you look at the growth trajectory plans of the company and understand that that debt is what I'll call friendly in debt. So Canadian government BDC -- BC is an actually a tough task master. So they can be demanding and strict, which is good, makes us a better company. But they are also keenly interested in helping innovate technology and small companies. And so they're quite supportive of us. And had no Silicon Valley venture debt on our books. Thank God.</p><p>And so our debt is something that is reasonably good. So our debt balance sheet, for example, is growing because of the FedDev $4-million loan, but it is 0% interest. It is 10 years. And when COVID hit, we had two existing loans with the Canadian government and a relationship with BDC, where all of them -- two of them voluntarily, they just send us an email and said, we're stopping to draw money. Like we're not going to take any payments, we'll just defer.</p><p>And so we have friendly debt and supportive debt on our balance sheets. We are looking at our balance sheet all the time. We're very focused on cash and improving our working capital ratios. So we have, as a company, moved from revenue driven to cash and EBITDA driven. There is one impact of that in that revenue does not realize us quickly when we get an order. So we used to kind of pre-spend when we saw the order coming and that's not the world we're in today.</p><p>And as a result, when we get a purchase order, it's more difficult to turn it around. So there's been times where I've gotten a purchase order and, November 28, and it was December revenue. That's not happening anymore because of our focus on cash.</p><p>FARRUKH ANWAR: Can I just add a couple of things in there? You also have noticed over here that there's lots of items that are not in the balance sheet. For example, the $7 million government grants that we have. Like out of that. FedDev is receivable, but it's done in the balance sheet. But as we continue to get our milestones in during the year, we will get that money in our bank.</p><p>Furthermore, we've also got inventory. We've got $3 million worth of inventory that we have. That inventory is being used on orders that we have. So there's less cash outflow right now on those orders because we continue to use the inventory that we already have built up. And then so combined with our cost structure, what we've done is we've reduced our costs. You've seen our margins go up. And then that's why you can see that with the reduced cost structure, expected pipeline conversion. We believe that our cash flow is going to be pretty much neutral with money coming in from, as Miriam said, the friendly debt from FedDev, which is interest free, which won't have -- we won't have to start paying until -- something around 2026 or 2027, something at that time.</p><p>So I think apparently the balance sheet looks off, as Miriam said, about this debt. But like overall, these items on the balance sheet that are not -- in our outlook that are not on the balance sheet as well. Thank you.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Farrukh, thanks so much for jumping in there. Sometimes I get so focused on thinking about the extra pages. Keep talking. That was really good. Thank you.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: I know we're running a little long here, but I just want to say thanks for everyone for staying on. We appreciate your patience and engagement. And we've got four more questions here. So this next question kind of has a few parts to it, Miriam. What led to the strong order intake in Q1 and what gives you confidence that a large portion of those orders will convert into revenue or have any these new orders began to ship?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: A crap load of work and effort by everyone in the company to bring the orders in and maintaining relationships. Myriad of change in the investment community and the market. So in North America, it's just we need more time to prove, but a big change in the order traction and revenue. We believe that part of that was because we needed to invest in our product line, and we responded to market demand by innovating in our product line with the CAMMI and now SENTI coming. Part of that was bringing on a lighting engineer who's got some great skill sets to help us. But the market demand is there.</p><p>So that's really on that side. On the Nano-Grid side, we do have some new businesses coming in. But the big part there is follow-on orders from existing customers. And then on eSite, these are some follow-on orders to existing customers of eSite as well as a large order from a Clear Blue customer for the eSite product. So this is a cross-sell upsell synergies.</p><p>The orders. It's really a timing on shipping. We have begun to deploy them and get them starting to move. Nothing has shipped as of yet, but work pyramid has begun. Things around trucks and boats in intermediary points, et cetera, et cetera. So things can always happen. But as I said, it would be surprised to see a big change because it's a diversified set of orders and we have more of our orders that we've received. We have an internal thing called ringing the bell, and we had another order yesterday that came in in North America. So we're seeing more stuff coming in on top of what we've already announced.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Can you comment on your recurring revenue growth? What are your expectations of that are in 2023?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: I can't give you a forecast for what it could be. What I think is interesting is as we introduced our energy as a service model in North America, which started around two to three years ago, that increased the annual fees that customers pay quite significantly because we took on some of the expenses they would normally have had to pay in other ways. So we evergreen the batteries, et cetera, et cetera. And so the first three years was upfront now, we have the renewals. We're seeing those renewals come in. And I'm quite pleased by that.</p><p>We've also, as I said, had customers reach out and say, well, can I add my other Esite-Micro Systems on? So it's very interesting because we used to be a bit concerned that customers didn't look at Illumience. And to some extent, they're not supposed to because we're running it for them. So that they have access to it. But they can see things, they get updates and reports. But they don't need to log in every day because that's what we do. We manage it for them.</p><p>But connectivity access to the site has become Tier 1 mission critical. So we get level one alerts from our customers now going, wait a second, the whole site's working, the telecom's all working, everything's great, but Illumience isn't getting its data. Level one problem. So the amount of demand of our customers to get access to what we're doing at Illumience devalue it's delivering, is evident and starting to put more pressure on the company. And that intuitively then also means all of it is still mission critical, you're going to be willing to pay for it. So that's what we think is driving the growth.</p><p>The other thing that's driving the growth is numbers multiply overtime. And so that's been helpful as well. We have been increasing the pricing, adding value, adding services. So the revenue per customer for Illumience has also gone up, and we'll continue to go up with eSite.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Thank you. These next two questions, we're going to take a step back and kind of look at the macroenvironment. How does the management navigated the current environment and kept those gross margin steady despite all of the global challenges?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: I think what happened in 2022 was we had -- so in the fall of 2021, there was the, oh my god, there's no parts available. We're not going to have any parts, et cetera, et cetera. And we went out and bought enough parts to make us match through. And then when revenue drop, we have inventory. So part of it was that we didn't see the big bump in prices in some of the things that we were dealing with. And in those areas where we were seeing the bump in prices, they were with long-standing partners who knew that they could just couldn't 100% pass it on. So because there were existing supply chains, not everything was passed on.</p><p>In other areas, we've talked about adding innovation. We have some very compelling cost components that we have been able to deliver a huge value on because we've innovated. So lithium batteries are a good example. We've got a lot of [smarts] in our technology which reduces the amount of smarts you need in the battery. It makes that battery more reliable and easier to manage. And because of that, for our Nano-Grid product, we have a very cost-competitive lithium battery. '</p><p>A lot of those commodity prices have come back down again. So in many cases, what I've seen suppliers do is we had the 2021 price list. The 2022 price lists just went through the roof. It was ridiculously stupid. And now people are coming back and saying, oh, yeah, here's our new price list and it's the same as 2021. So I think we've weathered through the store</p><p>FARRUKH ANWAR: And some of our suppliers, what they did was they just added in a surcharge like inflation surcharge or the high-cost surcharge and whatnot. And now this year, we have seen that they've removed that because the prices have gone down now.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Obviously, everyone's seen the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States and Canada. Just to note through version to match that, how does Clear Blue benefit from those various government incentives?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: So historically, Clear Blue's business was not tied like many solar to the feed-in tariff program of Ontario Hydro, et cetera, et cetera. But these tax breaks are across -- like think of them like a shred or an R&amp;D tax credit. They are across the entire industry. They are refundable tax credits, and they are available to both tax-paying entities and non-tax-paying entities. And when you put all of that together, it's just adding that extra little bit of incentive that allows customers to really look at us as an option, look at clean tech options as an option. And then when you put that together with a certain amount of acceptance that yeah, this works, it's not a problem and it's cost benefit, it's having a big impact.</p><p>Where we're seeing it is in Illumient business in North America, and we expect to also see it in Pico-Grid in North America.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Okay, you have one final question here regarding the eSite acquisition. Can you give us an example of revenue synergies with eSite since that acquisition closed?</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Well, so two revenue synergies. One is existing eSite customer, has requested Clear Blue's Illumient service on their existing historical systems. And on new orders, we had two or three customers where when we acquired the company, the customer was saying that the price was too high. You've got your drop price; you've got to go cheaper. And when we repackaged it with the Clear Blue value proposition and services, it reduced other costs for the customer. And by taking those other costs off the table, we increased our margins on the product and still had a lower cost for the customer.</p><p>So the customer's like, well, I'm going to spend $10 with you; well, I got to spend another $5. And we're going no, no, no, we're going to spend $12 with you as you don't need to spend that $5. So the customer went from $15 down to $12 and we went from $10 to $12 with the value add.</p><p>On the Clear Blue side, we have a one partner customer on who has a very wide ranging, diverse set of power needs \\. And we have a new project that's deploying that is at the higher end of power. And it was kind of pushing the envelope of Clear Blue. They're committed to us. They like us. They want our service. And so when we did the eSite acquisition, they say, yeah, we want that. So I don't know that the project was at risk, but it was under stress because it was pushing the envelope with the Clear Blue system and with eSite, they're just really happy. And so we have a large booked order that we'll deploy with eSite.</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: Thank you, Miriam. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of the call. Once again, if anything arises after the call, feel free to send an email with your question to either <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investors@clearbluetechnologies.com\">investors@clearbluetechnologies.com</email>, or myself, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ryan@sophiccapital.com\">ryan@sophiccapital.com</email> So I pass the mic back to you, Miriam, for closing remarks.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Thank you so much, Ryan. I just want to say very big thank you to all of our shareholder, investors, and supporters, and to our employees, our customers, and our supplier community. And it's been a tough year and a half. We're through it. We're positive and optimistic and busy as all heck from a sales perspective and a shipping-production-delivery perspective, and we would not have gotten there without everybody being very supportive of the company, and I think it will pay off for everybody going forward. Everything I do every day is all about making sure that we deliver for our investors. We serve at the pleasure of the shareholders.</p><p>Thank you very much. If there's any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. And I do want to give a big shout out to Farrukh, our CFO. If you just think about everything we just talked about in this presentation, he has just done a fantastic job helping this company to navigate and deliver what it needed to deliver. And we would be nowhere without him. Thank you so much.</p><p>FARRUKH ANWAR: Thank you. Thank you, Miriam. Thank you so much.</p><p>OPERATOR: The recording has stopped.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Ryan?</p><p>RYAN FREEMANTLE: We still have 13 attendees online.</p><p>MIRIAM TUERK: Are they all here?

I'm Jason Chaffetz, in for Sean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And tonight, we begin with a St. Patrick's Day message from the president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you were singing, even though I've never lived in Ireland, I've just kept thinking of the places that I did live, with my grandparents in Scranton when Scranton died -- not died, which Scranton -- everything went south in Scranton. We moved to Claymont. It's just as amazing what song does.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHAFFETZ: While Biden babbles incoherently, there is a massive scandal unfolding in plain sight. According to the House Oversight Committee, at least four members of his family raked in a combined over one million dollars from a Chinese energy company. Some of the payments allegedly took place just two months after Biden left his post as vice president in 2017, while other payments occurred when Joe was still the vice president.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): Well, the president said he had no knowledge of his son's business dealings, but in fact, many of these people who were responsible for sending the money from China to the shell companies were people that Joe Biden in fact met with. He met with while he was vice president.</p><p>I don't think anyone in America would believe that Joe Biden didn't open doors for these people, that that Hunter Biden somehow got these business deals set up in just a 60-day period after Joe Biden left the vice presidency. This is something that Joe Biden was actively involved in throughout the last year of his vice presidency. We've had several people come in and say that.</p><p>In fact, even some of the transfers to that Robinson Walker Company happened during 2015 and 2016, a time when Joe Biden was very much vice president of the United States. And I've got some bad news for the White House, this is just the beginning, and we've been meeting with people that have been blowing the whistle on this influence peddling scheme for up -- for several months now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Now you can call these accusations public corruption, bribery, access peddling or pay to play. But the mainstream media, they won't call it anything. They don't see a problem with the Biden family raking in cash from America's biggest geopolitical foes. They won't even look at the bank records. They won't investigate potential crimes. They don't seem to care why a Chinese energy company paid Hunter Biden, a crackhead, six hundred and ten thousand dollars, or James Biden, Joe's brother, three hundred and sixty thousand dollars, or Beau Biden's widow, Hallie, a school counselor, thirty five thousand dollars.</p><p>So what's going on here? And will the media mob ever wake up and ask a question?</p><p>Joining us now with reaction, co-host of \"The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show\", Buck Sexton, along with FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.</p><p>Tammy, I want to start with you because this infuriates me. There is no intellectual curiosity by the national media, no inquiry and this is in black and white, bank records, emails. They have got the goods.</p><p>Comer, as chairman of the Oversight Committee which I used to chair, he's doing a pretty good job of laying out the case, but nobody's asking any questions.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: What's fascinating, Jason, is that this was you could find this it was right there in black and white if you had any ounce of curiosity.</p><p>So the other question is, why would the Democrats not be curious about it? I mean, we can disagree with Democrats on policy issues. But my goodness, this is about the safety of the country. It's about national security. It's about life and death when it comes to our military members and our service members, and that the nature of our ability to live our lives here in our own country.</p><p>And the Democrats have had so much power, how that -- we have to presume that they knew an element of this and they didn't care. It also tells you of course the weakness of their back bench that this is what they have to accept as they move forward to try to take the White House.</p><p>So I think that there's a lot of you -- you mentioned it, could be bribe -- called bribery, it could be money laundering, it could be a whole host of things. But the fact is in just a few months that the Republicans kind of are looking at it, this is what they found and of course this is just what we know of at this point. This is the thing that that they were -- this kind of implies because it was done so sloppily, that this may have been going on for an extended period of time.</p><p>And, of course, we know the corruption in general of the establishment. Maybe it goes beyond the Bidens. It's -- but nobody up until now, Jason, has really been curious about it.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right. Buck, it's a -- it's just the classic fall of the money. See what it tells you, see where it's flowing and as chairman comer has pointed out, this is information but from one bank and there's at least if not more banks that were flowing money through to the Bidens.</p><p>BUCK SEXTON, \"THE CLAY TRAVIS &amp; BUCK SEXTON SHOW\" CO-HOST: Look, we know that it was a massive web of influence peddling and that this is corrupt at a minimum. But I think what you also have to look at is where the money is coming from. Isn't it interesting? It's a big world out there, and yet the Bidens we're getting money from Ukraine and China, the Chinese communist party, two countries where obviously there's a lot of corruption, a lot of U.S. foreign policy interests at stake, a lot of global foreign policy interests at stake beyond that, and they thought they were buying something with this money.</p><p>They were not buying Hunter Biden's legal expertise and that then also brings me to what about the two-tier justice system that we have in this country. I mean, as we sit here right now, we're talking about yet more obvious evidence of they can say, oh, this is all legal and fine. Really? Because Hunter Biden admitted not paying taxes, there's a money laundering investigation into them, along with a bunch of other crimes, we're sitting here talking about more evidence of what the Bidens were up to here, getting paid off by in the case of the Chinese Communist Party, our most important global opponent.</p><p>And yet Donald Trump may be arrested next week for hush money payments were being told? That's being reported all over the place. I mean, you couldn't see any more clearly, Hunter Biden can do whatever he wants, break whatever laws he wants, no one ever even thinks he's going to get charged realistically and Donald Trump has 15 investigations against him, all of which are bogus and nonsensical and yet he's actually the one who might get arrested.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah. To Buck's point Tammy, this whole idea, why did they get this money? What was it that they were doing? Because you're right, it wasn't for his legal expertise and this money is flowing from all over the world. It was coming out of China. It was coming from the Middle East. It came out of Romania via Louis Freeh, a hundred thousand dollars go to Joe Biden's grandkids. I wonder what the grandkids were doing to help the Biden family enrich themselves.</p><p>But why aren't they asking the question of what was the money for, Mr. President?</p><p>BRUCE: Well, see, and that's the answer. We know what the money is for, it's influence, it's the nature of, well, you know, you let a Chinese a communist party balloon traverse the entire country before you shoot it down over the Atlantic Ocean. You send you leave billions of dollars of military equipment in Afghanistan.</p><p>You use -- promise and send billions of dollars of support to Ukraine while at the same time really making ourselves too weak in a way to respond and assist Taiwan if Taiwan needs help. I mean, you see that the dynamic here.</p><p>And I think the American people, what they got used to with Trump, like him or not, is that there was finally some transparency. In Buck's point, is that it's that kind of transparency and commitment to the country outside of what the establishment does that is so threatening. Only people terrified would create the cartoonish persecution of Donald Trump while looking away at the nature of something so obvious to regular people using our country like their own ATM, and almost as though there was a an organized crime framework that was global, that was affecting the nature of the American government.</p><p>None of that is acceptable and I think the American people are going to have a few statements about this in the upcoming elections. Let's hope so.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah. And, Buck, you know, it's interesting. I read through the statements that uh the representatives for the Biden family come out with and guess what? If you read it carefully, they don't actually deny it. They don't actually deny that this money is going into the Biden bank accounts.</p><p>And again, no questions, no curiosity, no reporting certainly not going to be on the front page of newspapers.</p><p>SEXTON: Well, it's fascinating they also no longer really deny that the laptop that lays all this out and is the reason why we know 10 percent for the big guy and all the rest of it, the laptop that came from that computer repair store, Hunter Biden is now suing that guy for invasion of privacy. That came out today as well.</p><p>So you look at what we've been told about this all along, oh, it's a witch hunt, there's nothing there. No, actually, everything that has been said so far about what Hunter Biden and more importantly, the Biden family, this is not about a wayward crackhead who is having lots of problems and doing stupid things and taking photos of himself with Ebola in his tighty whities. That is a part of it and we have all seen this.</p><p>This is really about the effort to try to buy access to the guy who is now the president of the United States. And you know, I come from an intelligence background, right? In the intelligence world you give people money you try to get them on the take from you so that you can leverage that later down the line. I mean, so to Tammy's point, they were making investments here certainly in the immediate access they could get after the Biden -- after Biden was no longer vice president.</p><p>But there's no reason to believe that the access entirely is gone or that any of the possible kompromat or compromising information they may have gotten access to from these interactions wouldn't be leveraged for foreign policy adversaries or a whole host of bad guys down the line. We have a compromised president. They lied about Russia collusion with Trump.</p><p>When you see what's going on with the Biden family, it's like everything they said Trump was doing, Biden was actually doing. And that's the world we're supposed to live in now., and now they're going to arrest and possibly over the Stormy Daniels nonsense, it's crazy.</p><p>BRUCE: If I could add one just -- just one thing in the sense that Hunter Biden who clearly has and had serious problems was used in this process. You know, a crackhead, he admits it, drug addict and that's the member of the family that was used to maneuver all of this. This is how craven this system is that the Bidens apparently, including the brothers, were using, and the American people have to know that.</p><p>It's -- it's -- we have to think about the nature that, you know, the moral nature of the ability to do this and whom they used.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah and as Chairman Comer has pointed out, isn't it curious that two of the Russian oligarchs that didn't get have sanctions put on them were doing business with the Bidens as well. This story has a long way to go.</p><p>Buck Sexton, Tammy Bruce, thank you for joining us tonight on \"Hannity\".</p><p>All right. Speaking of Hunter Biden, he's now a counter -- he is now countersuing John Paul Mac Isaac for invasion of privacy after the computer repair shop owner distributed an abandoned laptop that Hunter's legal team is still refusing to validate. So just to recap, the Biden family can apparently sell access to the highest levels of our government in face zero consequences.</p><p>But former President Trump might soon face an indictment for a far-fetched campaign finance violation over an alleged payment seven years ago to a porn star, a state charge for a federal crime. How does that even work?</p><p>Well, we've got not the right legal experts tonight, FOX News is reporting that Manhattan's district attorney Alvin Bragg has requested a meeting with the secret service ahead of a potential arrest.</p><p>Here now with more, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and author of \"Get Trump\", Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.</p><p>Thank you, gentlemen, for joining us tonight.</p><p>Gregg, I want to go to you. You follow the legal pursuit of Donald Trump as close as anybody I know. What's your re -- what is going down here because it does look like there might be some action on President Trump next week?</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it looks like it and I must say, this is probably the most cockamamie legal theory I've ever heard of Alvin Bragg. Forget the statue of limitations that expired two years ago, he is bringing a case against Trump based on a misdemeanor records violation, trying to supercharge it into a felony by citing a second crime or right, what second crime? Oh campaign violation, but which? It can't be a state campaign violation because it was a federal election, and it can't be a federal violation because state and local prosecutors can only bring state-driven cases.</p><p>You know, on top of that, he would have to prove that Trump personally was involved in falsifying records. He would have to prove that Trump understood these convoluted campaign finance laws that nobody understands and then intended to violate those very laws.</p><p>And finally, he's got to get around the dual purpose doctrine. The law says that if you have a secondary purpose like a personal or commercial reason for paying somebody money, and it's not a campaign contribution and that's been Trump's argument all along. So, you know, this is a case that I doubt very much is going to get past a motion to dismiss.</p><p>CHAFFEZ: So, Professor Dershowitz, the Democrats will say, oh, look, at all the smoke here. They've been saying that for years and years and years, oh, look at all the smoke, there must be something wrong. What's your take on it?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR: There are two systems of justice in the United States and our justice system is in deep trouble. We've created a special system of justice for Donald Trump. That's why I wrote my book \"Get Trump\". I document over and over again how different standards apply to Trump, to his lawyers, to his associates and a system of fair justice can't tolerate that.</p><p>There is no crime here. Let's be very, very clear. Crime has to be absolutely clear. It was Justice Jackson who once said, any prosecutor can rummage through the statute books and find something against virtually anyone. I think Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the KGB, put it more precisely when he said to Stalin, show me the man and I'll find you the crime. That's what's going on here.</p><p>They have targeted Trump. The attorney general of New York ran on the campaign get Trump. Bragg essentially did the same thing. They rummaged for years to try to find something. They gave immunity to witnesses. They couldn't find a real statute so they put statutes together.</p><p>You know, it was Thomas Jefferson who once said that for a criminal statute to be valid, it has to be so clear that you can understand it if you read it while running. Now, I'm sitting and I've been teaching criminal law for 50 years, I cannot understand this theory.</p><p>But where I disagree with Jarrett is I don't think there'll be a motion to dismiss that succeeds. This is New York justice. In New York, of course, you can indict a ham sandwich. But in New York, you can also convict a ham sandwich because the jury pool will be very much against Trump and the judges will be very much against Trump.</p><p>So if I were him, I would be worried today. He'll probably ultimately win on appeal, but do judges today have the courage if they run for election as prosecutors run for election to do something favorable to Trump in a city which overwhelmingly despises Trump, that's what's wrong with this justice system. That's why Bragg shouldn't be asking the question can I indict, he should be asking the question, should I indict? The answer to that question is categorically no.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Hey, I've got to move -- I want to move quickly, Gregg, because I want to go back to this idea that Hunter Biden is now counter-suing the person who released the laptop. What's your take on that?</p><p>JARRETT: Yeah, I read the lawsuit. It's silly and frivolous. Hunter Biden claiming that his laptop was misappropriated and his privacy invaded. But in the same breath in the lawsuit, he said, well, it might not actually be my laptop. You cannot sue based on a maybe.</p><p>That's like saying, oh, my house was damaged, I want to be paid for it. But actually, it might not really be my house. So they'd have to amend this silly complaint to go further.</p><p>But you know, on top of that, he cites a one-year law that says property is abandoned after a year. Well, that's true, unless there is an agreement, a contract. And he signed a contract saying it's abandoned after 90 days if I don't come get it. But on top of that, throughout the contract, he didn't try to retrieve his own laptop until more than a year.</p><p>So he didn't even comply with the law that he is citing in his lawsuit. So it is silly and frivolous, but it doesn't surprise me. It's Hunter Biden.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: But the surprise --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Professor, very quickly, do you agree with that?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: And he'll -- you know, there'll be a lot of depositions and there'll be a lot of discovery about things regarding other members of his family. When you bring a civil lawsuit, be careful, beware, make sure you have nothing to hide.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well, this family I think probably does have a lot to hide.</p><p>So, gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight on \"Hannity\". Do appreciate it.</p><p>All right. Coming up, Biden's economic crisis goes from bad to worse with the recent bank collapse. Is America headed for a recession or worse? Brian Brenberg and Steve Moore react.</p><p>Plus, a new terror warning out of Afghanistan. Full details, straight ahead.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>Biden's banking crisis -- well, it continues tonight. Following historic collapse, Silicon Valley Bank's parent company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. But it may not be the last financial institution to implode.</p><p>First Republic Bank shares dropped over 30 percent today, despite a billion dollar infusion deposited from other major banks. Now, Americans are growing increasingly concerned about a looming recession.</p><p>According to a recent survey, 75 percent are worried that a major economic downturn is on the way, while 55 percent said they would lose everything if it happens.</p><p>Here with reaction, co-host of the \"Big Money\" show on FOX Business, Brian Brenberg, and founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Steve Moore.</p><p>Gentlemen, thanks for joining us.</p><p>Brian, let's start with you. How worried should we be when $30 billion dollars is infused into a bank and the stairs shares still drop by a major, major portion?</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, FBN HOST: This is -- this is extraordinary, Jason. I mean, there has been so much money thrown First Republic's way, and the whole point of it was to make sure depositors felt good about their deposits and investors felt good about the company.</p><p>And investors have said, we don't buy it. And if you look at that for a second, you look at Janet Yellen up on Capitol Hill, trying to tell people banks are okay, what people are saying is they don't believe her.</p><p>They don't believe the president. They don't believe the Fed. They don't believe the treasury secretary.</p><p>They don't think that regulators are on top of this and it's hard to blame them, because the looming example of SVB showed us you had a bank that wasn't minding its business, regulators that weren't paying attention and because of those two failures, taxpayers are on the loop, on the hook for all of these deposits now that are above the $250,000 threshold.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah, come on. The president said that taxpayers wouldn't have to pay anything. Obviously, that's the truth, Steve Moore. Now come on, what is really concerning about this is the big picture, the confidence that the markets would have in this. The stock market didn't drop precipitously, but the underlying concern about the health of the banks -- give us your perspective on what's going on there.</p><p>STEVE MOORE, FOUNDER, COMMITTEE TO UNLEASE PROSPERITY: Well, first of all, Brian is exactly right in his analysis I just added that not only are average American skeptical, but you know what? They are extraordinarily angry about what's going on.</p><p>What we have once again is this kind of incestuous relationship between big business, big banks and big government. And the idea that taxpayers aren't going to pay for this is a laughable claim.</p><p>It's also a kind of a laughable claim that this is only going to, you know, we're just going to -- we're doing this to help the middle class depositors of these banks. That's not true, Jason. How many middle class people have a quarter of million dollars in a savings account?</p><p>This is really -- and the irony of course is that last week remember, the president was saying, oh, we're going to sock it to the rich, and we're going to make the rich pay their fair share. And as a cartoon said in the paper today which was so appropriate, oh, yeah, we're going to soak it to the rich and make them pay more taxes so we can bail out other rich people, because that's exactly what this is here.</p><p>And people are angry because they don't see this as being fair. And there's another a problem here too, which is you're actually rewarding a lot of bad behavior by these banks.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: You know, what's stunning to me, Brian, is you look under the hood. It's not like I've been studying the Silicon Valley Bank, but as you start to read about this, only one of their members of the -- of their board of directors had actual banking experience, and then you had the head of the bank who was on the Federal Reserve Board there in San Francisco, with a major conflict of interest.</p><p>And so, I mean, how does this type of thing happen? And then all of a sudden, you have this implosion of billions of dollars and people -- well, how could that happen? Well, maybe you didn't play by the rules, maybe it was just these Democratic connected people with the Democratic Party getting these super rich jobs being on the board cashing in make big money going on ski trips to Davos and not paying attention to how the market actually works.</p><p>MOORE: I'll tell you, it's real simple. They didn't care about getting deposits back to people. That was not their priority, Jason. Their priority was reinventing finance making it climate change sensitive, and DEI appropriate. The last thing they cared about was making sure people who put money in the bank got it back.</p><p>And you can see that now because they ran their business like they didn't care about it. They'd even have a chief risk officer last year. They had somebody for DEI. They had a diversity officer, they didn't have anybody with the core responsibility of making sure the loans you made and the investments you made could pay back depositors.</p><p>That's the problem here. This isn't even a complicated issue. The problem came down to interest rates went up. Everybody in America knew that was going to happen but they didn't run their bank like it would ever happen and that's why taxpayers absolutely ended up on the hook for this.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah --</p><p>MOORE: By the way, let me add something to that if I may --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Go ahead.</p><p>Can I just make one quick point? Of course, Brian is right. But then the question is, why did interest rates rise so quickly from a federal funds rate of 0.5 percent when Trump was president to almost four and a half percent today? And you know the answer to that, Jason, because we've had this massive six trillion dollar spending spree.</p><p>It all goes back to Biden's incredibly reckless financial policies and fiscal policies that have met -- loaded the economy with debt and cheap money and the interest rates rose and it was just one domino after another that fell. The most important thing going forward right now is Congress has to press cut trillions of dollars of excessive government spending out of the budget right now, or we're going to face a financial peril in this country.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Amen. It's what creates inflation. It's what creates those problems.</p><p>Real quick, yes or no, both of you. The people that cashed out -- that put millions of dollars in their pocket that were in these in these companies could see it ahead of time, are they going to be prosecuted? They're going to be do they have to give this money back at all? Brian first and then Steve.</p><p>BRENBERG: I ain't hold my breath, Jason. I hate to say it, but I'm not holding my breath that they're going to pay.</p><p>MOORE: I think a good conscience, they should pay it back. I do. I think in good conscience, they should pay it back. The idea that they were giving out bonuses two days before they need a bailout, that smells pretty fishy to me.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah, I hope that this country holds the president and Kamala Harris accountable. No taxpayer funds, but I think it's impossible for them to actually pull that off.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you for joining us.</p><p>All right. Coming up, Biden's weakness on the world stage continues to damage our national security, as threats from China, Russia, Iran and now ISIS are on the rise. Joey Jones and Congressman Michael Waltz react, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>A dire new warning from U.S. Central Command. ISIS-K, the same terror group that killed 13 of our service members during the Afghanistan withdrawal, could strike American interests in less than six months. So if you thought the fallout from Biden's botched Afghanistan withdrawal was over, think again.</p><p>The terrorists aren't the only American enemies growing bolder. Chinese President Xi will reportedly meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow next week to launch a new era of collaboration between their two nations. This despite the fact that Putin is now a wanted man. The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant for his arrest over possible war crimes in Ukraine.</p><p>But thanks to Biden's weakness, America's enemies have nothing to fear.</p><p>Here with reaction are Florida Congresswoman Mike Waltz, and FOX News contributor and retired marine, Joey Jones.</p><p>Both of you have served in the military. We appreciate your service. We thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>Congressman, I want to go to you first. A lot of news, a lot of bold moves on the international stage. Set the stage for us. Explain to us what's happening and why we should be worried.</p><p>REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Well, China is continuing to assert its role as -- in its effort to replace the United States, not to become a global superpower but to become the global superpower. So, Xi is going to meet with Putin in the coming weeks. If the Chinese unleash their military arsenal to support Russia, Biden's saying as long as it takes, it's going to take forever.</p><p>We need to set a red line to that support and it needs to be a Trump red line not an Obama red line like he said in Syria that that everybody walked all over. And then on top of that, China just brokered a deal with -- with Iran and Saudi Arabia, where the United States has completely vacated the scene.</p><p>So China's great weakness is its energy dependency. It needs oil from the Middle East and it's buying gas by the gallons, by the millions of gallons from Russia. Meanwhile, our great weakness -- I mean, our -- excuse me, our great strength in the United States is energy dependence, but Biden's at war with that. He's at war with our -- with our -- with our independence.</p><p>So look, this is -- this is people seeing a lack of leadership. This is them seeing weakness in this White House and our enemies, namely our number one in enemy, China, is on the march, replacing the United States on the global stage.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: So, Joey, next week, you have a meeting with these two leaders. You also have reports of a Russian energy company helping with Chinese nuclear -- their nuclear program. You have this new relationship in the Middle East with Saudi Arabia and Iran. I mean, and you have a president who seems feeble and can't even figure out what's going on our southern border, let alone on the international and world stage.</p><p>JOEY JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, it seems like President Biden's almost the best libertarian candidate at this point because his isolationist policies are really starting to work. We're kind of on an island by ourselves anymore.</p><p>But, you know, you have -- I think Republicans in Congress are using the term all of government approach when it comes to responding to this. So if you're taking all of government view when it comes to national defense, this isn't just bombs and bullets.</p><p>It's not the fact that we pulled out of Afghanistan. It's how we did it. It's not the fact that we're hurting our own energy independence but it's the idea that China controls 90 percent of our -- of critical minerals in the world.</p><p>We're allowing Russia to export natural gas while we're making ourselves more dependent upon China in order to use renewable energy. So you go down the line. We can't control southern border, so now we have Mexican cartels that are equivalent to -- when it comes to killing Americans -- ISIS, Taliban and al-Qaeda put together.</p><p>And so, when you go down the line, when we talk about the word weakness, I mean, the office of the presidency isn't an easy job. But the one thing you can't do is be indecisive or to make decision things that you're not consistent with, and it looks like the dog wagging the tail, looks like the president is constantly reacting rather than being proactive and defending us in some way or making a strategic defense so that we can have a position of strength.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah. I mean, you got a president there that's weakening the standards in terms of, you know, recruitment, and then trying to figure out and spending more time on how to go green and make sure we everybody you know has the choice to go to whatever bathroom as opposed to fighting and winning wars.</p><p>Congressman, I want to go to what General Kurilla, who is the commander of Central Command, one of the most important posts in our United States military, and what he's telling us is -- in what he testified to -- is that ISIS is reformed and within six months has the ability to reach out beyond the borders of Afghanistan to strike the United States. What -- what's your take on this?</p><p>WALTZ: Well, we've seen -- yeah, we we've seen this horror movie before, Jason, when Obama yanked us out of Iraq with no backup plan, we had the explosion of ISIS on the scene three years later in 2014.</p><p>But at least then when we had to go back to deal with that, we had the Kurds, our allies on the ground. We had access from the ocean. We had bases in places like Jordan and Turkey and Israel. We had a government to work with in Baghdad.</p><p>In Afghanistan, we have none of that. We have no bases. We have no government to work with. Our allies are being hunted down as we speak by the Taliban. They'll never work with us again.</p><p>So God help us if we have another San Bernardino, Pulse nightclub, or God forbid, a 9/11, we have nothing. This is what pisses me off the most for our future special operators to go back with work with. That's the go forward.</p><p>Looking back, we just had our first hearing in Afghanistan about the Afghanistan withdrawal in the Congress. And listen, the sniper that was at Abbey Gate had the suicide bomber in his sights and was denied permission to take him out three times.</p><p>So we've got to deal with what's coming but we also need accountability for those Gold Star families.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Joey, I've only got 20 seconds. What can you add to that?</p><p>JONES: Yeah, you know, if you only work with friends that are of pure heart and righteous, then you don't have any friends at all. President Trump was chastised for Saudi Arabia and China and Russia and North Korea, trying to get some type of strategic diplomatic communication with some of those countries.</p><p>And President Biden ostracizes every attempt at that, but he makes a deal with the Taliban that gets some of our marines and soldiers and sailors killed. So that's where we are.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Gentlemen, again, thank you for your service to our nation. And I got to tell you, it just feels like we're taking an eye off the ball. That we're supposed to be here to protect our homeland and to prevent an actual terrorist attack. And it just feels like we're vulnerable right now because we've taken ire off the ball.</p><p>That's my take. Hopefully, it never ever happens.</p><p>All right, coming up next, critics are mocking Governor Gavin Newsom for his latest plan to address California's homeless crisis, but you won't believe this.</p><p>Plus, wait until you see the reception Kamala Harris got at the NCAA tournament. We'll show you this as the \"Hannity\" special continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\"</p><p>After failing to address California's homeless crisis for years, Governor Newsom has a brand new plan. Now he wants to spend $30 million to build 1,200 tiny homes for his state's growing homeless population. Unfortunately, there's more than 160,000 homeless people in state of California. So, the math, it isn't quite adding up.</p><p>Meanwhile, fellow Californian, Vice President Kamala Harris just made an appearance at the NCAA tournament between Kansas and Kamala's alma mater, Howard University, where she was reportedly booed by the crowd.</p><p>Her alma mater ended up losing by 28 points. And to make matters worse, Howard's players were forced to endure one of Kamala's inspirational pep talks after the game. Have a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You played lard. You played to the very last second. You made all us Bisons so, so proud.</p><p>You hustled out there. You are smart. You are disciplined. You put everything you had into the game.</p><p>I mean, literally what you have done is a historic proportion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Joining us now for reaction, host of the FOX True Crime podcast and FOX News contributor, Emily Compagno, a \"FOX Across America\" radio host and stand up comedian Jimmy Failla, and FOX News contributor Leo Terrell.</p><p>I'm sorry, I just -- when Kamala Harris said, you fought till very last second, and then you lost by 28 points, I just, you know? Leo, you're from California.</p><p>LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: So, you bring us into this. What do you think those guys after losing by 28 points, and I'm sure there was a senior on the team who will never play organized basketball again and they got to listen to that.</p><p>TERRELL: Yeah. I mean, she thought she was Luke Wackney (ph). And listen, she went -- those guys were demoralized. She did nothing to elevate them.</p><p>She basically talked down to them, talked to them like they were kids. And I tell you right now, there was nothing that she articulated that inspired these guys after a very, very beating that they took in that game.</p><p>Kamala Harris does not have any -- she doesn't have any charisma, doesn't have any credibility. She's a disaster.</p><p>I'll tell you right now, the Democratic Party knows she's a disaster, Jason, but they can't get rid of her. They know she's incompetent but because of her skin color and her gender, they are stuck with her, and that's her problem right now.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Look, Howard is a good, reputable school. But, you know, for her to go out there and say it was historic what you did, I don't know. I mean, Kansas is an awfully good basketball team, Emily. They have destroyed teams by more than 28 points.</p><p>I don't know what was particularly historic about this other than her being in the locker room. I didn't get it.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It reminded me of that Goldie Hawn moment from the movie \"Wildcats.\" I think you all know what I'm talking about, where basically it's like, you just shouldn't be here.</p><p>I'm from California, too. There's many things that I'm embarrassed about with that state. She being in the number two spot, because number one is Gavin Newsom, which I know we're getting to in a moment.</p><p>But the problem with her and I agree with Leo is that condescension is the last thing you need to hear. It doesn't matter what position you hold. It doesn't matter if you're the vice president. It's what's coming out of your mouth isn't inspiring.</p><p>You have to earn the respect of that position. And I think I speak for a lot of people when I would say that's the last person I would want in my locker room after a March Madness loss.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: All right, Jimmy. Bring us home on this one. What's your take?</p><p>JIMMY FAILLA, COMEDIAN: Well, I just love this whole thing because number one, they have nothing to be proud of. They didn't cover the spread. You know how many people like me are out money because of their effort.</p><p>Number two, okay, she's only in the arena because she had the Electoral College going to Final Four. She didn't know they didn't have a team. She's an idiot.</p><p>And let me just tag in with this, she doesn't know anything about sports and you can tell when she's talking. She's like, oh, my God, you guys hit a home run on the basketball court and it was a touchdown for all Americans. That was embarrassing.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: It reminded me when she was with the paid actor kids. You're going to get to see the moon and you're going to see things, and it's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAILLA: Did you notice? By the way, did you notice, they didn't show anyone else in the room in that video but her? They cropped to her because if you showed the rest of the room, they would have been looking at their phones, eating pizza. They weren't paying attention.</p><p>She was getting the reception someone gets on the subway asking for money at rush hour. Everybody pretend they are on their headphones and can't hear them. Please.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: That's right. That's right.</p><p>All right. Leo, we got to switch to tiny homes in California. The governor has plan. He wants to spend $30 million of your money, Leo.</p><p>TERRELL: Well, Emily will help me out on this one as well.</p><p>Gavin Newsom is a fraud. He came out with statement in 2008 saying he had a plan to take care of the homeless problem. He's five years late. This plan is a disaster.</p><p>He has done nothing for the state of California. And, honestly, Jason, he's already checked out. He's a lame duck governor. He drops to his knees every day and hopes for bad news for Joe Biden so he can get out of California and destroy the nation.</p><p>Gavin Newsom is honestly and truly a horrific governor. Bad for the state of California and that's why we have people leaving the state. That's why I might have to join Jimmy where he lives because California is a total disaster.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Amen to that. Emily what's your take on this? Thirty million dollars for 1,200 tiny homes. I don't know where they will put the tiny homes, but you know?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yeah, I was living in San Francisco when it was Mayor Gavin Newsom. Remember his care not cash program. That failed miserably at the time, the same lofty, box- checking goals that had nothing to do with reality.</p><p>Ironically, just last year, this skyrocketing rate of homeless are in the town left with over 20,000. The local NBC paper said it's an example of an inability to counter the rising homelessness.</p><p>In L.A., they spend $837,000 per single homeless person. Gavin had the nerve to boast when he presented this plan that we, meaning Californians, have spent $10 billion on the half a million homeless in the state. For some reason, he sees the ratio, the higher rising cost of investment and the equal highest rising cost of homelessness as something to be proud of.</p><p>The more money you throw at the problem, the more it's not working. He, as Leo says, yes, it's a fraud and he's unfortunately crop dusting every single thing he touches in the state. The best thing for the state, the best thing for the homeless would be for him to leave.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah. But, you know, there is a guy, Jimmy, I swear he wakes up every morning and looks in the mirror and says, good morning, Mr. President. That's the guy, right?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally.</p><p>FAILLA: Well, the bar has been set so low for president. I mean, I might throw my hat in the ring if it weren't for the background check.</p><p>But let's talk about it for a second. You know, I got to correct everybody here on screen. California is a very woke state. You're not supposed to say homeless. They are called free range people now. You can't say homeless.</p><p>Here's what is so absurd, okay? It's 1,200 units. There's over 160,000 people. You talk about bringing a cup of water to a forest fire, but this is a cup of pee on a sidewalk because it's California.</p><p>But it's disgusting and shame on him. When you subsidize something, you only get more of it -- not less, more.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: No, this is a problem. Look, it's a serious issue, but this is not a serious governor. He doesn't have a serious plan to actually deal with it.</p><p>And he's been governor long enough that if his plan was so fruitful, if it was working so well, why did the numbers continue to rise? Why did they have hundreds of thousands of people leaving the state of California?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yeah? Go ahead.</p><p>FAILLA: I was going to say, that's why the only thing he will be president of is U-Haul. He's been so good for the business. They're about to make him CEO.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I got to go. Thank you so much for joining us on this St. Patrick's Day. Really do appreciate it.</p><p>More after this. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. As always, thanks for tuning in, thanks to Sean for letting me sit in his seat.</p><p>I hope you have a chance to check out my podcast, \"Jason in the House\", just type in, \"Jason in the House\", and you'll find it. Sean will be back next week -- next week. Thanks. Have a wonderful St. Patrick's Day.</p><p>\"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2023031701cb253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67T6-R9T1-F072-X3PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 17, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS516120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Families</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

I like to be the one to build the bonfire, set off a firework or even just light a piece of paper on fire and watch as it burns away to ash. However, as we know from Avatar: the Last Airbender, fire gets a bad rap. Why is the fire nation the villain? Isn't it just as natural as water, earth and air?</p><p>So, when I got an email from WCSB (the Wisconsin Chapter of the Society for Conservation Biology) in mid-November that included an opportunity to participate in a prescribed burn, I was interested. Prescribed burns are intentional burns for land maintenance. The fire clears out vegetation, replaces old tree stands with a new succession of plants and replenishes vital nutrients for the soil such as carbon and nitrogen. Fires are a necessary disturbance for prairies and oak savannas, the dominant native ecosystems in southern Wisconsin. However, these prairies and oak savannas are now endangered habitats due to fire suppression, which became standard practice in the 1920s in Wisconsin in response to slash fires, an agricultural technique, and threats to urban settlements. When fires are suppressed, trees grow and shade out the prairie or savanna, and the ecosystem converts into thick forest which has a higher risk of burning uncontrollably when the spark does -inevitably - catch. There is growing recognition of the danger of fire suppression policies for land, and the necessity of prescribed fires.</p><p>\"There's a whole cascade that works its way through the ecosystem by improving the vigor of that one activity, because these are systems that are adapted to being frequently burned,\" said Jeb Barzen.</p><p>Jeb Barzen founded Private Lands LLC, which explores methods of ecological restoration on privately-owned lands, and is an adjunct professor at UW-Madison.</p><p>\"I teach a prescribed fire and field ecology course at UW-Madison, do work that's similar to a contractor, and work that's similar to a non-profit,\" Barzen explained.</p><p>I drove out to the prescribed burn at a prairie that Jeb Barzen was leading on his property in Spring Green, Wis. on a Wednesday afternoon, not really knowing what to expect. The goal that day was to burn five acres in order to clear out vegetation so there would be space to plant native vegetation in its place. I watched a couple of Youtube videos on prescribed burns in order to prepare, but I wasn't sure if an undergraduate student with no previous experience would be allowed to start setting fire to a whole field. I pulled into the sandy driveway and joined a small circle of pyro-ecologists, others like me who were interested in environmental conservation and liked to burn things. Everyone else there had years of experience conducting prescribed burns and were excited to welcome me into their group. I got outfitted in a fireproof shirt, helmet, gloves, a radio and put on a water pack. I took off my jacket because Barzen warned me, \"once the fire starts, you'll be warm.\"</p><p>Barzen adjusting my water pack. Photo by Marcia L. Getto, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gettophotography.com\">www.gettophotography.com</url></p><p>The group climbed up the hill to start the burn. I was put on a team with a veteran pyro-ecologist to burn the length of the top of the hill. At first, my job was simply to monitor that the fire didn't go past the set boundaries, and use my boot to snuff out any wayward sparks. However, after about ten minutes, I was instructed to pick up a drip torch and begin to help set the fire itself. Soon, the air filled with smoke as the pyro-ecologists spread out, lighting any plants in hope the fire would catch. My water pack was heavy on my back as I followed the bank of a stream. Unfortunately, that day the humidity was too high, and the fire never really caught. After two hours, we ended up burning just over an acre of land.</p><p>Barzen says that according to the Wisconsin Fire Needs Assessment, less than 1% of the land that needs to be burned in the state is currently regularly being burned, but between 80-90% of ecosystems in the state are fire-dependent. Barzen believes it is imperative that we find ways to increase the amount of prescribed fires, particularly on private land. Hiring a contractor to do this is generally very expensive. One of the best ways to help, according to Barzen, is to increase the number of people, particularly volunteers, involved in prescribed fires.</p><p>The initial line of fire being ignited by the drip torch.

Get content from The Daily Cardinal delivered to your inbox</p><p>Email</p><p>To this end, Barzen is teaching LANDARC 581- Prescribed Fire: Ecology and Implementation at UW-Madison for his fourth time this spring. The first half of the course prepares students with an understanding of fire ecology, and in the second half, the class gets to go out to the UW-Madison Arboretum to do prescribed burns themselves. Students are also required to do burns three separate times with organizations outside of class. At the end of the course, they receive certifications which are necessary to be on prescribed fire crews. Cole Wilson, a fourth-year wildlife ecology major at UW-Madison, took the course last spring and says that he cannot recommend it highly enough.</p><p>Wilson describes prescribed burns as an \"important and underutilized tool by ecologists.\" He participated in two prescribed fires outside of class with Barzen, including one where they went out to a marsh burning the tops of canary reed grass.</p><p>\"I was knee-deep in water, in a huge, heavy suit while lighting things on fire... and you could hear boreal chorus frogs,\" Wilson recounted.</p><p>This class inspired Wilson's future career path. After graduation, Wilson is planning to apply to Conservation Corps positions with burns or as a wildland firefighter.</p><p>Barzen's work is helping to bring back a community that has the knowledge and skills to perform the prescribed burns which were stigmatized, and thus erased, during colonization.</p><p>However, Barzen says that \"there's still a lot we can learn from indigenous cultures about prescribed burns ... what we've forgotten because of ... an active removal of our concept of fire as a good thing from our culture.\"</p><p>According to the video Oshkigin Spirit of Fire, people indigenous to the Great Lakes region used fire as a tool to alter the environment for their advantage for a thousand years. Native Americans did burns to open up space for settlements, get rid of insects and stimulate the growth of fire-dependent species such as blueberries. However, after a deadly fire in a lumber town in Wisconsin in 1871, Franklin Hough, the first chief of the US Forest Service, promoted fire suppression in order to protect timber resources. Since then, anti-forest fire propaganda such as Smokey Bear shaped many people's views on burning as something dangerous and harmful to a landscape.</p><p>\"The more we attempt to maintain an ecosystem in a static condition, the less likely we are to achieve what we intended,\" Robert Averill, a member of the forest service wrote over a hundred years later in his paper on disturbance processes such as fire.</p><p>Averill's research showed that maintaining an ecosystem requires disturbances that alter it; land needs to go through cycles of disturbance and subsequent regrowth.</p><p>\"Native Americans figured this out hundreds of years ago, while we figured it out 50 years ago,\" Barzen summarized drily.</p><p>Now that we have this knowledge, we need people to help put it into action. So, put on some clothes made of natural fiber and leather boots and go join a burn crew. Fire isn't as intimidating as you might think, and you'll feel like a bad-ass walking around with a drip torch -</p><p>Trust me.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5202672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64NS-6JR1-DY7P-T07J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Cardinal: University of Wisconsin - Madison</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 30, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Madison</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>WI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzhCQjM1OUZEM0I4NEZDRTg3MkFDMjVDNTc4QjRDOTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzE4OTFEMTAwRUIxNEQ5MTg4MzUyRDM2RjNGNEFBMTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

The National Weather Service is predicting highs in the 90s today and Wednesday.</p><p>The Weather Service on Monday issued a fire weather watch that includes most of Baker County starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing through Thursday afternoon for lightning. Although initial storms could be dry -- which increases the risk of lightning sparking fires -- storms that linger into Thursday have a better chance of delivering rain, according to the Weather Service.</p><p>Livingston said the fire season so far has been about average -- typically the highest risk for major fires in the region runs from late July through August and, occasionally, continuing into September.</p><p>This year so far is quite different from several recent summers, including 2018, when June was warmer and drier than average, the fire danger index set record highs in late July, ranging from 79 to 84. By comparison, the readings for Sunday ranged from 47 to 61.</p><p>One advantage to the fire danger remaining below average well into July is that firefighting crews, aircraft and other resources are comparatively plentiful, Livingston said.</p><p>The largest local fire, which burned 6 acres on July 15 near California Gulch, about 14 miles southwest of Baker City, was quickly controlled by fire crews on the ground and with aerial assistance from two single-engine tankers and one helicopter.</p><p>The fire, which started near Highway 7, was human-caused, and Forest Service officials are investigating, said Travis Mason-Bushman, a public information officer for the Wallowa-Whitman.</p><p>___ (c)2020 the Baker City Herald (Baker City, Ore.)

I've had friends I thought would do well in political races, and others I knew would fail, and I've not only told readers and listeners\u2014I've told the candidates. In Larry's case, I'll aim for objectivity despite a mild tug of conflict; his win would mean losing him on the radio, where I have valued him for decades.</p><p>So could California find itself with a staunch conservative governor after the recall dust settles? It certainly could, but first voters will need to deliver the actual thumbs-down for Newsom. Only then will the door be open for Elder and the large crowd of hopefuls offering themselves alongside him.</p><p>Any governor facing a recall threat has a problem. For a Democratic California governor, the election reveals a dissatisfaction that extends beyond the usual Republican minority. Conservatives have hammered Newsom for liberal decisions like the planned phaseout of gasoline-powered cars. But from his COVID-19 response to forest fire susceptibilities to rolling blackouts, his track record has dimmed enthusiasm even among those who voted for him.</p><p>But this is still California, a state that has returned countless <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Democrats</url> to office in good times and bad. Toppling a governor who won his general election by 24 points will not be easy. However, Newsom's ascendancy in 2018 came before COVID responses were the prime determinant of every governor's popularity. If every Democrat favored lockdowns and other restrictions, and only <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republicans?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Republicans</url> opposed them, Newsom would not be in trouble. As COVID ran roughshod over the nation, California businesses and families blamed Newsom's restrictive policies for the outsized damage they sustained.</p><p>Timing is everything. As the recall gained steam, the virus retreated in California and across the nation. Newsom announced a grand \"reopening\" of the state on June 15. A voting public with diminished coronavirus concerns would have been more likely to spend the ensuing weeks replacing unpleasant memories of restrictions with fresh experiences made possible by reopened businesses and restored liberties.</p><p>Now Newsom's biggest enemy may not be any Republican rival, but the Delta variant. As COVID reclaims the headlines, Californians may wonder what new orders lie ahead from a governor who once wielded such effortless shutdown powers.</p><p>A happy state does not ditch its governor. It is the job of the 40-plus candidates on the recall ballot to sow sufficient discontent that a majority chooses to return Newsom to private life. If COVID policy riles up enough Californians next month, the governor's fate is in deep question.</p><p>If Newsom survives the stay-or-go vote, his challengers will disperse back into their prior pursuits. But if he falls, the next governor of California will be the top vote-getter on that crowded ballot, which could mean a successor earning well below a majority.</p><p>This is where the door opens for Elder. A majority of Californians do not share his conservatism, but they may get a master class in it nonetheless. There is no shortage of Republican hopefuls, from former San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer to state assemblyman Kevin Kiley to Newsom's 2018 opponent John Cox. But no one, not even the briefly attention-grabbing candidacy of Caitlyn Jenner, has come close to Elder's poll numbers in the weeks since surveys began. Democratic candidacies have been suppressed by the fact that most Democratic voters are likely to back Newsom.</p><p>So there is Elder, whose sizable talk show audience and appreciable communications gifts have ensured him the support of a strong plurality among expressed favorites to replace Newsom. There is a large chunk of undecideds, but it is hard to see them falling sharply toward any other single candidate.</p><p>Since this is a referendum on Newsom, Elder's chances do not hinge on how popular he is, or how knowledgeable he may be on the issues. This election turns on a single question: do Californians want to get rid of Newsom? If the answer is yes, Elder may soon be choosing drapes for the governor's mansion.</p><p>Since the only path to success involves voters souring on Newsom, the Elder pitch has not focused extensively on the governor's liberalism. The appeal is aimed across the ideological spectrum, at Californians lamenting the state's suffering economy, increased crime and struggling school system.</p><p>If voters believe Newsom is not the right leader to navigate those troubled waters, the recall will succeed. And if it does, Larry Elder may become California's most conservative governor since Ronald Reagan left Sacramento in 1975.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mark Davis is a talk show host for the Salem Media Group on 660AM The Answer in Dallas-Ft.

Now, anime and fans have a better look at the design of one of the follow-up's protagonists.</p><p>The official <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Yasahime: Princess Half-Demon</emphasis>Twitter account posted an image of Inuyasha and Kagome's daughter over the weekend, complete with color scheme and more information on what fans can expect from her.</p><p>Take a look at the final design of Moroha, from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inuyasha</emphasis> sequel, below:</p><p>Fans of the manga/anime will recognize Moroha as having a similar-looking red cloak to her father, Inuyasha. There are also hints of white in her costume, likely referencing her mother Kagome's outfit.</p><p>The biggest defining feature of Moroha's costume is her giant red bow, which looks like dog ears, similar to the ones Inuyasha has. Kagome and Inuyasha (when he's in his human form, that is) have dark black hair, which Moroha also has.</p><p>According to the official series <url normalizedValue=\"http://hanyo-yashahime.com/\">website</url>, Moroha is a 14-year-old bounty hunter. She kills yokai and trades their body parts\u2014like fangs\u2014for money.

The twins are also 14 years old, according to the official series website.</p><p>Here's the full synopsis for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Yashime: Princess Half-Demon</emphasis>:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">In Feudal Japan, Half-Demon twins Towa and Setsuna are separated from each other during a forest fire. While desperately searching for her younger sister, Towa wanders into a mysterious tunnel that sends her into present-day Japan, where she is found and raised by Kagome Higurashi's brother, Sota, and his family.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ten years later, the tunnel that connects the two eras has reopened, allowing Towa to be reunited with Setsuna, who is now a Demon Slayer working for Kohaku. But to Towa's shock, Setsuna appears to have lost all memories of her older sister.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Joined by Moroha, the daughter of Inuyasha and Kagome, the three young women travel between the two eras on an adventure to regain their missing past.</emphasis></p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inuyasha</emphasis> sequel is being developed by Japanese production company Sunrise, which had a hand in the original <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inuyasha</emphasis> anime.</p><p>What do you think of this latest update to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Inuyasha</emphasis> sequel?

Photo: AUDIO NETWORK  <br/>The fires have been fanned by the country's worst most severe heatwave in decades and the authorities have pointed the finger at climate change, which experts say increases the intensity and frequency of such extreme weather events. <br/>Algeria has meanwhile become the latest Mediterranean country to be hit by devastating wildfires this summer, with the death toll there rising to 65 on Wednesday after eight people were killed in blazes in Turkey earlier in the month. <br/><br/>A huge multinational force has been deployed to back fire crews on the Greek island Evia, where the town of Istiaia has been under threat for days. <br/> Satellite image showing smoke plumes from wildfires on the Greek island of Evia, August 9. Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA  <br/>\"I think we can say that the fire fronts are slowly coming under control,\" Istiaia mayor Yiannis Kontzias told state TV ERT. <br/>\"Yesterday, we saw the light of the sun for the first time in days,\" he said, referring to giant smoke clouds that have choked residents and obstructed flights by water-bombing aircraft. <br/> With the assistance of a huge multinational force, Greek fire crews were fighting to beat back blazes on the island of Evia and in the Peloponnese peninsula Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>But even as the immediate danger receded, Kontzias said local businesses \"face extinction\" in coming months in a tourism season already decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic. <br/>\"We have lost the month of August, which would have sustained people here over the coming year.\" <br/> Tourism has been demolished and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades, officials say Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>\"(Local) tourism has been demolished, most (visitors) have left,\" he said. <br/>\"The damage is huge, and the environmental disaster will have economic repercussions for decades.\" <br/>From July 29 to August 11, more than 93,000 hectares (231,000 acres) were burnt in Greece, according to the European Forest Fire Information System. The average area burnt over the same period between 2008 and 2020 was 2,330 hectares. <br/> With the assistance of a huge multinational force, Greek fire crews were fighting to beat back blazes on the island of Evia and in the Peloponnese peninsula Photo: AFP / ANGELOS TZORTZINIS  <br/>A draft UN assessment seen exclusively by AFP called the Mediterranean a \"climate change hotspot\" and said increasing temperatures and aridity had lengthened fire seasons and \"doubled potential burnable area\". <br/>Dimitris Haliotis, the head of a Red Cross team who came to Evia from across the country in Patras, said that \"the entire ecosystem is destroyed\" on the island, with the loss of forest animals running in the hundreds. <br/>Theodoros Roumeliotis, the local hoteliers president on the Greek spa town of Aidipsos, said August reservations had collapsed by 90 percent. <br/> Wildfires in Greece Photo: AFP / Thorsten EBERDING  <br/>\"It's a colossal loss,\" he told AFP. <br/>\"Right now, hotels are obliged to refund one million euros in reservations cancelled,\" he said, adding that some operators were unlikely to survive the blow. <br/>The fire situation was more precarious on Wednesday in the mountainous Peloponnese region of Gortynia. <br/>Christos Lambropoulos, deputy governor for the broader Arcadia region, said efforts were concentrated on keeping the fire from reaching the thickly forested Mount Mainalo. <br/>\"Villages do not seem at risk at the moment... but conditions change by the hour,\" he told ERT. <br/>Forces in Gortynia were beefed up Wednesday to nearly 600 firefighters including crews from the Czech Republic, Britain, France and Germany. <br/>EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and more than 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were due to arrive by Friday. <br/>Support from abroad has helped avert an even greater disaster. <br/>\"When we arrived, it seemed like the whole of Greece was burning,\" said Nicolas Faure, part of a detachment of French firefighters that arrived last week, and was later bolstered to over 170. <br/>Another 60 firemen were tackling a smaller fire in Laconia, in the southeastern Peloponnese, the fire department said. <br/>In Evia, nearly 900 firefighters had been deployed, including Cypriots, Moldovans, Poles, Serbs, Slovaks, Romanians and Ukrainians. Serbian, Swedish and Swiss planes and helicopters were among a fleet of seven aircraft providing support. <br/>There have been growing calls in Greece for the resignation of top public safety officials who as recently as June had insisted that the country was well-prepared. <br/>There was additional anger over the loss last week of much of the forest of Varibobi, one of Athens' last remaining nature reserves. <br/>Civil protection deputy minister Nikos Hardalias said Greece's resources were \"stronger than ever before\". <br/>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis this week apologised to the nation for any possible \"shortcomings\" in the state's response. He is to hold a press conference on Thursday. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162868622388725879100062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BR-96K1-F03R-N43M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><timeReceived>12:50 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 11, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;
