One expert said it's a recipe for disaster on the wildlands where some timber has a fuel moisture drier than kiln-dried wood.<br/>\"It's a very, very dangerous fire day tomorrow,\" fire behavior specialist Stewart Turner said at a briefing Thursday night on the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest in Las Vegas, N.M.<br/>\"Like we saw last Friday, epic fire behavior,\" Turner said. \"It's a day that as a firefighter, we'll write about, we'll read studies about. It's going to be a big fire day.\"<br/>A swath of the country stretching from New Mexico and Colorado to Kansas and the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.<br/>Red flag warnings for extreme fire danger were in place Friday for nearly all of New Mexico and parts of Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.<br/>The expected high winds will likely ground firefighting aircraft in some areas, officials said.<br/>More than 3,000 firefighters were battling fires in Arizona and New Mexico on Friday - about half of those in northeast New Mexico, where more than 187 square miles of mostly timber and brush has been charred.<br/>They focused Thursday on preventing it from moving into the rural New Mexico community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures.<br/>\"Great progress again today,\" incident commander Carl Schwope said Thursday night. But \"tomorrow has the potential to be a very destructive day.\"<br/>\"It will be chaotic if anything close to what happened (last) Friday occurs,\" added operations chief Jayson Coil.<br/>Sheriff Chris Lopez, of New Mexico's Miguel County, confirmed for the first time Thursday night the fire there has destroyed at least 166 homes, 108 outbuildings and three commercial buildings. He joined authorities in neighboring Mora County in pleading with residents to pay close attention Friday to sudden changes in closures and evacuation orders.<br/>\"Falling trees, possibly falling power lines, that's the kind of winds we're looking at,\" Lopez said.<br/>Turner, the fire behavior specialist, said the winds are only part of the problem. He said moisture levels in downed logs and woody debris are \"extremely dry\" - just 2 percent in small twigs, pine needles and grasses that \"actually carry a forest fire across the landscape.\"<br/>Moisture in a log \"the size of a 4-by-4 post you buy at the lumber store   are coming down to 8 percent,\" he said. \"Kiln-dry is 12 percent. So out there, that's drying to what a kiln would do.\"<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8043783</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65BJ-T1N1-DY7P-P2BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Columbian Publishing Co.

It won't be sprouting into a sunflower anytime soon, though. The conditions just aren't right. So what does it take for a seed to turn into a plant anyway?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are all kinds of seeds. Beans, popcorn kernels and peas are all seeds, and even though they seem different, they have the important things in common. A seed is made of three basic parts. On the outside of the seed is the seed coat. This protects the seed until it is time to start growing. Inside of the seed coat is the seed embryo, which is a tiny, immature plant. Surrounding the seed embryo and making up much of the body of the seed is the endosperm, which is a tissue that stores nutrients to help the seed grow until it can grow leaves and create its own food.</p><p>If seeds have everything they need to grow into a plant, what's stopping the beans in your cupboard or the sunflower seeds in your snack mix from sprouting? Even though they have necessary nutrients and components to grow, the seeds will wait until they encounter the specific outside conditions that will ensure they can successfully grow into a plant. The main elements required for a seed to germinate, or begin to grow, are water, light, temperature and oxygen.</p><p>Seeds have an amazing ability to tell when the conditions are right and it is safe to start growing. In the meantime, they stay dormant, which means their growth and activity is put on pause. This is somewhat similar to how some trees lose their leaves and go dormant for the winter season. They're not dead, they're just waiting for safe conditions to grow again.</p><p>Seeds have two hormones, and these hormones function as chemical messengers. One sends the message to start growing and the other sends the message to stay dormant. The conditions outside the seed are signals. Once the seed senses all the right signals, like moisture and the perfect temperature, the growth hormone is sent out and the whole seed knows it is time to get busy.</p><p>Although most seeds need room temperature to germinate, a few seeds have more unique requirements for growing conditions. For example, some seeds only germinate after experiencing the hot temperatures of a forest fire, which cracks the seed coats. Other seeds require cold temperatures to end their dormant state.</p><p>Once the conditions are right, the seed begins to absorb water. This allows the cells inside the seed coat to swell and the seed's food storage to break down into useful energy. The swelling will usually cause the seed coat to break, and out pop the roots. The seed is able to detect the Earth's gravitational pull, so it always knows which way is up and which way is down.</p><p>Even though the seed needs water to start growing, it can't have too much of it. This is because the seed also uses the surrounding oxygen molecules for energy. It converts the oxygen into energy through a process called aerobic respiration. If the seed is in sopping wet soil, it will not access enough oxygen.</p><p>Soon after the roots pop out of the seed coat, a sprout shoots up in the opposite direction. This small shoot will push its way out of the soil and into the open air and sunshine to form a plant stem and the plant's first leaves. At this point, the seed is officially germinated.</p><p>Over the growing season, the plant will create brand new seeds, and the process happens all over again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-39450246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62D1-BX61-JC0C-J368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>MAIN Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 7, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST0008WVX</classCode><className>HORMONES, SUBSTITUTES &amp; ANTAGONISTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1LG</classCode><className>SPOKANE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A26S</classCode><className>EARTH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

About a decade ago, these bodies became increasingly concerned about the rising economic and financial risks from climate change, and the fact that the financial system lacked the information, tools, and markets to manage them. For example, although the Bank of England oversees the world's largest international financial center, including the world's fourth largest insurance sector and the largest reinsurance market, Lloyds of London, we realized that the system did not have access to clear, consistent, and decision-useful information on climate risks.</p><p>Recognizing this was a global challenge, in 2015, the G20 Presidency tasked the Financial Stability Board with assessing the financial stability risks from climate change. Over the following years, a wide range of regulatory authorities and private financial institutions have worked to develop the fundamental building blocks the financial system needs to begin to manage climate-related risks on behalf of their depositors, pensioners, clients and shareholders. This is leading to better climate-related financial disclosure, stress tests and transition planning. Many leading financial institutions are improving their climate risk management and channeling capital to make companies more competitive through investments to reduce their emissions.</p><p>However, while the pace of change has picked up, it is not yet commensurate with the scale of the challenge in America or globally. Due to the undiversifiable nature of climate risks, governments will bear many of the costs of extreme weather and adaptation. Moreover, the longer adjustment is delayed, the greater the impact of climate change on financial stability, inflation, jobs and growth. Conversely, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will reduce the impact of climate change, create the jobs of the future, and promote a resilient financial system.</p><p>Physical impacts of climate change are rising</p><p>Globally, each of the last four decades has been warmer than the decade that preceded it. n1 The past eight years were the warmest on record, with each of those years exceeding 1 degree Celsius of warming-or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit-over pre-industrial levels. n2 The average sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least 3000 years. n3 Extreme heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, as have heavy precipitation events and major storms.</p><p>Data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NASA, among others, provide a snapshot of how climate change is already impacting the United States. To summarize:</p><p>. Since the 1970s, unusually hot summer days have become five times more common on average across the U.S., and unusually hot summer nights have become almost ten times more common. n4</p><p>. Since the 1960s, heatwaves in the U.S. have become more common, more intense, and longer lasting. The average annual frequency of heatwaves in the U.S. has tripled since the 1960s, with each heatwave lasting an average of 30% longer. n5</p><p>. While the incidence of drought varies across the country, the western U.S. is experiencing a mega-drought that has persisted for over two decades, making it the most intense in at least 1200 years. n6 In May 2022, almost three quarters (72%) of the land in western states was classified as under either severe, exceptional, or extreme drought conditions. n7</p><p>. Median sea levels along the U.S. coast have increased by about 9 inches since the early 20th century, increasing the frequency of high-tide flooding for U.S. coastal communities by five to ten times since the 1950s. n8</p><p>. The intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms affecting the east coast of the U.S. has risen significantly over the past twenty years, making the period since 1995 the longest stretch on record of above-average hurricane seasons in terms of NOAA's Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index. n9</p><p>. Across the western United States, there has been \"a profound increase in forest fire activity\" in recent decades, driven by persistent drought and temperature increases in these regions. n10 The Congressional Budget Office analyzed trends in wildfires and found that on average, 8 million acres burned in wildfires annually between 2017 and 2021, more than double the average thirty years ago. n11</p><p>Climate Change is having increasing impact on Americans</p><p>. Weather-related damages: Adjusted for inflation, the number of billion-dollar disasters has risen six-fold from an average of three per year during the first half of the 1980s to an average of 18 per year over the past five years. The average annual inflation-adjusted costs of these disasters have risen seven-fold from $18 billion to $120 billion. n12 I know from my time as an insurance supervisor that, globally, these increases in insured losses are even higher, and that uninsured losses continue to set new records.</p><p>. Sea-level rise and property destruction: At least $1.4 trillion worth of American homes and businesses sit within one-eighth of a mile of the coasts, and shoreline counties have almost 50 million housing units, housing over 40% of the U.S. population. n13 As noted, increased flooding and coastal erosion are already causing significant damage, with an estimated $15.8 billion of eastern seaboard property value eroded between 2005 and 2017, n14 and it is estimated that, absent massive spending on adaptation, over $500 billion worth of real estate in the U.S. could be below sea level by 2100 under a higher warming scenario. n15</p><p>. Increased homeowner insurance costs: Increases in weather-related disasters have led to insurance becoming less available and more expensive for American families. For example, the National Flood Insurance Program has been the insurer of last resort for most Americans living in flood zones since 1968. Since the 2005 hurricane season, the NFIP has been unable to cover its payouts with premiums. n16 Federal flood premiums are expected to increase significantly as the program adjusts its risk ratings. More broadly, with property losses from natural disasters increasing, policy premiums are expected to increase significantly for American families, with one reinsurer estimating that climate-related risks will result in a 22% increase in global property insurance premiums over the next 20 years. n17</p><p>. Agricultural output: As anyone who grew up in a farming area--as I did--knows, extreme weather has an acute impact on agricultural production. The increased frequency of drought, heatwaves, freezes, and flooding is likely to significantly impair agricultural production, reducing incomes for American farmers and raising food costs for American families. n18 . For example, a NASA study projects that, absent action, corn yields globally will begin declining over the next twenty years. n19 Variability of yields will also increase. So while studies project that every Iowa county will experience production declines of 10% or more by 2050, declines will reach 25% in some counties by 2030 and over 40% in 2050. n20 This is because, while growing-degree days are expected to increase by a modest amount, killing-degree days will increase by significantly more-an expected 57% by 2030 and 94% by 2050.</p><p>. Warming is already estimated to have contributed $27 billion, or almost 20%, of national crop insurance losses between 1991 and 2017. n21</p><p>. Supply chain disruptions: The increased frequency and intensity of flooding and disasters can disrupt or damage critical infrastructure, and in turn supply chains, hurting American businesses and raising costs for American families. For example, the Texas deep freeze in February 2021 n22 caused the worst involuntary blackout in U.S. history, closing three major semiconductor plants, which in turn slowed the production of new cars in the U.S. n23 In the same vein, in December 2021, an extreme typhoon damaged a large Malaysian port, shutting off semiconductor shipments from Taiwan, leading to semiconductor shortages that caused U.S. car manufacturers to suspend operations. n24</p><p>Physical impacts will worsen over time</p><p>These trends are expected to worSen. As the U.S. Global Change Research Program concluded in its most recent National Climate Assessment, \"the severity of these projected impacts, and the risks they present to society, is greater under futures with higher greenhouse gas emissions.\" n25 There is ample scientific evidence that with each additional fraction of a degree of warming, extreme weather becomes more frequent and more intense. n26 In the U.S., this means more frequent and more intense hurricanes; more frequent and deeper coastal flooding; hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting heat waves; longer-lasting and more frequent droughts, and more of the wildfires that accompany them. n27</p><p>There are thresholds beyond which warming--and therefore extreme weather--is likely to accelerate rapidly due to unlocking feedback loops, such as the thawing of Arctic permafrost, which would lead to rapid release into the atmosphere of carbon that's currently frozen. n28 There may also be certain warming thresholds beyond which catastrophic physical impacts are locked in irreversibly--so called \"tipping points.\" These include the collapse of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, or the significant dieback of the Amazon rainforest, which could alter the earth's water cycle. n29</p><p>Scientific modeling has assessed the likeliest temperature and broader climate outcomes under different collective country policy responses. If governments cut emissions in line with their current, stated climate policies, the world will be on track for warming of 2.4 degrees Celsius (or 4.3 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels by 2100. n30 If all governments were to achieve their net-zero objectives on the timelines they have outlined, warming would be limited to 1.8 degrees. n31 Even in this optimistic scenario, there would be a substantial increase in extreme weather and economic costs facing America and the world, but we would be less likely to hit irreversible tipping points or activate critical feedback loops. n32</p><p>Potential impacts on GDP and beyond</p><p>The insured and uninsured losses noted above measure the value destruction of the stock of assets. GDP is a measure of the flow of income. At the global level, estimates suggest that, over the balance of this century, climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per capita by 10-20% without efforts to limit warming, the equivalent of a decade of no economic growth. n33 Similar estimates have been found for the United States. n34</p><p>While GDP represents a single year's worth of value added in the economy, estimates of the impact of the economic impacts of climate change project that what is lost is likely to stay lost, making climate change the curse that keeps on taking. In other words, these are level effects on GDP that are not recovered, unlike for nearly all other shocks to the economy.</p><p>As economically significant as these estimates are, it is instructive to examine what is not included in them, both 'assets' outside the market economy--such as biodiversity and human health--as well as critical economic channels that have not been modelled, including disrupted supply chains, the very real challenges to monetary and financial stability that increasing climate change will present, and the potential economic impact of rising risks to national security.</p><p>Increased temperatures, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and greater sea level rise can all negatively influence human health, including through heat-related illnesses like cardiovascular complications; easier spread of vector-borne pathogens like West Nile virus; and increased transmission of water-borne illness like diarrheal disease. n35 For example, hot days affect human health through several channels, with the most extreme effects-including increased mortality-felt by vulnerable populations such as the elderly and pregnant women. Comparing higher and lower warming scenarios, an EPA analysis found that under a lower-warming scenario, expected additional deaths from extreme heat in 2090 could be cut by half, saving over 4,500 lives and $80 billion in damages per year compared to a higher-warming scenario. n36</p><p>Over time, the extreme impacts of climate change are set to make large areas of the world, currently home to large populations, uninhabitable. With livelihoods and lives of over a billion people directly affected by the spread of lethal climatic conditions, there are very real prospects for significant increases in involuntary migration and conflict over increasingly scarce resources and arable land. n37</p><p>Government budgets will need to adjust to climate impacts</p><p>As temperatures increase and extreme weather events worsen, the costs to governments-local, state, and federal-will increase further. n38 Ultimately, governments bear costs that private households, businesses, and markets are unable to shoulder. That is most evident for natural disasters, with local, state, and federal governments being forced to devote an increasing share of their budgets for meeting emergency needs, financing disaster recovery, and building resilience to future disasters.</p><p>Adapting and building resilience to the changing climate can help minimize some of the worst impacts, but it will be costly. Adaptation will require a wide range of investments in infrastructure and technology to withstand higher temperatures, higher sea levels, more flooding, more droughts, and worse storms. For example, ports will need to be protected against sea level rise and increased storm surge, with total potential costs for these improvements at over $200 billion through 2100, or $100 million per year for the port of Los Angeles. n39</p><p>Addressing climate change creates major economic opportunities</p><p>To conclude, the costs to property, agriculture, and livelihoods are already high and are expected to grow materially. The potential hit to GDP growth from unmitigated climate change is expected to be significant. And many of the most severe impacts--to human health, to livelihoods, and our natural heritage--are not included in these calculations.</p><p>But there is one final risk from climate change--a negative risk--better known as an opportunity. Increasing recognition of the risks of climate change is now galvanizing global efforts to address the issue. In recent years, the number of countries committed to achieving net zero has risen from less than one third of global emissions to over 90%. n40 In response, many companies are developing net-zero transition strategies, and private financial institutions managing balance sheets representing almost 40% of private financial assets are doing the same. With climate policies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and RePowerEU, becoming increasingly impactful, and with capital widely available to finance investments for emissions reductions, both carbon efficiency and climate resilience are becoming increasingly important determinants of company and national competitiveness.</p><p>Last year, over $1 trillion was invested in the energy transition, representing over 1% of global GDP. These investments are expected to rise significantly in the coming years n41, contributing to more jobs and higher incomes. For example, the IEA estimates that multiplier effects from the clean energy investment boom will lead to 4% higher GDP by the end of this decade. n42</p><p>In short, while ignoring climate change will lead to significant costs, climate solutions are becoming one of the greatest commercial opportunities of our time. In seizing them, as in so many other respects, the United States remains the indispensable nation.</p><p>Thank you again for the invitation to testify.

Alvarez now lives in Boston.</p><p>Novelist Kristin Hannah will answer questions about her books at 4 p.m., June 23. Since 1991, Hannah has written more than 20 novels, including \"The Nightingale,\" which follows the fortunes of two French sisters during World War II.

A former attorney, she lives in the Puget Sound area.</p><p>Adventure writer Peter Heller is scheduled for 7 p.m., July 7. Heller has written fiction and non-fiction. His latest novel, \"The River,\" was published in 2019. \"The River\" is the story of two longtime friends whose camping trip is complicated by a massive forest fire and a woman who may be fleeing a murder attempt. Heller lives in Colorado.</p><p>Blake Crouch will talk about his works and answer questions at 7 p.m., July 28. Crouch has authored the best-selling novel \"Dark Matter\" and the \"Wayward Pines\" trilogy.

Some of the timber was damaged badly, and removing the surviving trees will be difficult because of the fallen trees.</p><p>Harvesting timber is completely mechanized, and skid steer tractors with large cutting blades have replaced chainsaws. But LSU AgCenter forestry specialist Robbie Hutchins said that machinery is designed to cut standing timber, not trees that are on the ground.</p><p>The hurricane's effects are continuing to affect landowners' bottom line. Timber that would have fetched $25 a ton might only realize $2 a ton because it is cut as salvage, Hutchins said.</p><p>Overall, state and federal estimates have determined the 2020 storms affected 920,000 acres in Louisiana, causing losses totaling $1.4 billion, Hutchins said.</p><p>The window for salvaging downed timber is narrowing as the trees start to deteriorate. \"For a lot of it, the shelf life is diminishing now,\" he said.</p><p>Many of the trees still standing have few limbs remaining, and their survivability is uncertain. \"Is there enough crown to keep that tree alive?\" Hutchins asked, gazing at a spindly tree with most of its limbs knocked off by hurricane winds.</p><p>Hutchins said more mills were in operation after Hurricane Rita. But with mills closing, like one near DeQuincy, timber landowners with small tracts have fewer options for selling their trees, and that usually means the market price will be lower.</p><p>Looking at the long-term implications, Hutchins said landowners now must decide if they are willing to invest in reforestation. Many did that after Rita, and now their investment has been hurt by the 2020 storms, he said.</p><p>The difficult situation with low prices paid for Louisiana timber comes at a time when lumber prices are at an all-time high. \"That is a huge disconnect,\" Hutchins said.</p><p>Lumber prices soared this year after many mills in other parts of the U.S. closed because of COVID-19 outbreaks among workers. Regional lumber inventories were depleted, and prices drastically reflected that shortage nationwide, he said.</p><p>But supply remained steady in Louisiana, and mills had plenty of timber, which kept stumpage prices low.</p><p>With so much dead wood on the ground, the potential threat of damaging insect and disease outbreaks along with wildfires are possible. Beetles could attack trees that are still in recovery from the storm, Hutchins explained.</p><p>Rush said forest fire potential will be high this summer, but he said fires could have the benefit of suppressing insects.

Getting a handle on them required preparation, perspiration and all hands on deck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To face off against a wave of fire starts sparked by a lightning storm over Southern Oregon, the Oregon Department of Forestry Southwest District broke the two counties into quadrants. Supervisors in each section strategized ways to utilize an extra 200 contracted personnel and six extra helicopters Thursday, while a fifth supervisor coordinated initial attack teams to tackle the newest fire starts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By the end of the week, a third of roughly four dozen new fires were extinguished, and containment lines were wrapped around nearly all of the largest of the new fires \u2014 the Hog Creek Fire near Merlin and the Rum Creek Fire north of Galice. The Hog Creek held at 30 acres as of Saturday, and only the Rum Creek fire was not lined as of late Saturday estimated at 100 acres, according to ODF spokeswoman Natalie Weber. (Corrected)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It continued a pattern so far this fire season in Southern Oregon of firefighters being successful at keeping fires small.</p><p>But the success sometimes comes at a high cost.</p><p>A firefighter working the Rum Creek Fire, 25-year-old Logan Taylor of Talent, was killed Thursday by a falling tree. Another firefighter working a fire on Tallowbox Mountain south of Applegate needed to be pulled from the fire lines after suffering a heat-related illness.</p><p>Firefighter Collin Hagan, 27, of Michigan, was killed Aug. 10 by a falling tree on the Big Swamp Fire north of Crater Lake.</p><p>A week earlier, Aug. 3, a firefighter working the lightning-caused Wards Creek Fire east of Rogue River needed to be flown from the fire lines to the bottom of the road then taken to a nearby hospital after working in temperatures in the high 90s.</p><p>Lightning naturally tends to strike the tallest point, according to ODF Southwest Oregon District spokeswoman Natalie Weber, so lightning-caused wildfires often are in steep terrain where crews also face challenges such as falling rocks and trees.</p><p>\"In a lot of cases, there isn't very good access, so firefighters are driving to the closest point and then having to hike farther up the hill to actually get to the fire in order to start working on it,\" Weber said.</p><p>Since the fire season began June 1, crews have faced triple-digit temperatures and hundreds of lightning strikes, not to mention multiple close calls. Yet as of this week, no local fire has surpassed the low double digits in acreage.</p><p>With fire season almost three months old, local fire officials shared insights on their efforts and the tools used to keep fires small.</p><p>Story of another summer</p><p>On July 15, 2018, a lightning storm sparked at least 145 fires across Southern Oregon. Many of those fires were quickly extinguished, but not all.</p><p>Within a week, the Rogue Valley's air quality forced Oregon Shakespeare Festival to cancel outdoor performances and Britt to move its outdoor classical concerts to North Medford High School's auditorium.</p><p>Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest Fire &amp; Aviation Staff Officer Dan Quinones was the forest's acting forest duty officer the day the 2018 fires broke.</p><p>Quinones also helped allocate resources this fire season, which has a different track record: 44 fires that burned a combined 8.07 acres. He described this season's strategy in a Zoom interview earlier this month.</p><p>\"The strategy in '18 and the strategy today are really the same,\" Quinones said. \"In 2018, we ran out of stuff \u2014 not just locally but nationally.\"</p><p>The July 2018 fires were competing with other pressing wildfires, according to Quinones, and the Geographic Area Coordination Center in Portland had to prioritize resources for fires threatening people, property and infrastructure.</p><p>Fires in backcountry and wilderness areas lost out. Quinones said the resources they had were focused on protecting communities in Ashland, Butte Falls, Jacksonville and Cave Junction.</p><p>\"We just didn't have enough stuff to get to those fires in a timely fashion, even though we had jumpers on them, etc.,\" Quinones said.</p><p>In the biggest firefights, such as those threatening entire communities, watersheds or critical infrastructure, the GACC has the ability to reassign resources. It's a sword that cuts both ways.</p><p>\"We might lose some aircraft or ground resources without being asked \u2014 they'll just take them,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones described a good relationship and rapport with the GACC Portland office as key to ensuring they understand the resources RRSNF needs to keep during fire season. Presently, he said, \"there are no issues.\"</p><p>\"They know our fuel type down here and that our fires, once they get established, are very resistant to control,\" Quinones said.</p><p>Bracing for lightning</p><p>When lightning is in the forecast \u2014 especially on dry fuels \u2014 Quinones will coordinate the strategic placement of hand crews, tree fallers, fire engines, water tenders, dozers and other equipment needed on the ground between stations in Prospect, Jacksonville, Powers, Cave Junction and Gold Beach, along with the J. Herbert Stone Nursery in Central Point.</p><p>\"We got some places to put stuff,\" Quinones said.</p><p>A forest duty officer at each of the districts oversees operations on the entire forest and will seek out input from staff officers such as Quinones.</p><p>\"From the bigger picture, I'll say, 'Hey, can we move this one asset from one location to another location? Because this is what we have going on,'\" Quinones said.</p><p>Quinones said he coordinates closely with partner agencies such as Oregon Department of Forestry in stationing and allocating resources.</p><p>\"We get all the tools in our toolbox that we need \u2014 not only for us but also for where we think we may need to support our partners as well,\" Quinones said. \"We stage them around the forest for quick response for the projected areas for the event.\"</p><p>New tools for looking ahead</p><p>Late last month, the Corey Fire broke out on the outskirts of Central Point and White City and started spreading to nearby properties, prompting the evacuation of approximately 25 residents nearby.</p><p>The fire started on a property containing large amounts of debris and abandoned vehicles, and it took out three mobile homes on the property, but the fire never grew beyond 5 acres, and 15 threatened structures were spared.</p><p>According to Fire District 3 Chief Robert Horton, the Corey Fire was one of six fires in his jurisdiction aided by two new camera-based technologies this fire season giving incident commanders the ability to see what they're up against.</p><p>Horton chairs the Governor's Fire Service Policy Council, which provides guidance to the governor and the Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office, and was recently named Vice President of the Western Fire Chiefs Association.</p><p>In prior years, incident commanders had to wait until the first firefighters arrived on scene and saw the fire with their own eyes before calling for the resources they need.</p><p>\"We have the technology today that allows for that visualization to occur at time of event, not time of first unit arrival,\" Horton said.</p><p>The Alert Wildfire Camera system utilizes cameras watching over roughly a dozen areas across the Rogue Valley, according to Horton.</p><p>The cameras are designed to complement those used in ODF's Detection Center, which looks out at rural areas in Jackson and Josephine counties.</p><p>\"They're looking for lightning strikes in the forest so they can get their resources out there fast,\" Horton said. \"Our cameras are more targeted toward the interface \u2014 where the forest is meeting the communities.\"</p><p>The camera Fire District 3 utilizes is on Long Mountain and covers parts of Eagle Point, White City and Sams Valley. Other cameras in the system include one on Mount Baldy that helps Fire District 5, providing a view of Phoenix, Talent and parts of Ashland. A third camera covers the Illinois Valley.</p><p>The public can view feeds from the cameras by visiting alertwildfire.org, but emergency response personnel have the power to pan, tilt and zoom if they need to zero in on an area, according to Horton.</p><p>Fire District 3 collaborated with Rogue Valley Council of Governments and Rogue Broadband to install the Long Mountain camera on the company's tower, according to Horton.</p><p>\"We really worked hard in that collaboration to have that camera and the Mount Baldy camera both operational by this fire season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Another technology rolled out in late June and early July is the new 911 Eye system, which allows a person calling in an emergency to send livestream video to the 911 dispatcher.</p><p>The 911 dispatcher can send the caller a link which can be shared with Fire District 3's incident command. If bandwidth is limited, the system can accommodate photos instead.</p><p>Since the Labor Day 2020 wildfires, Horton said there are more firefighting resources at the local level than there were.</p><p>Funds made available from the Oregon Legislature last year through Senate Bill 762 provided fire agencies added funding that Fire District 3 utilized to add a wildland response unit on shift every day.</p><p>\"Right on initial response we have more units to send out to calls,\" Horton said.</p><p>Other districts throughout the Rogue Valley used the fire funding to increase their staff, and SB 762 also covered added resources such as engines and air resources for ODF.</p><p>\"We've got more firefighting resources in our system \u2014 across the state but especially here \u2014 since the 2020 season,\" Horton said.</p><p>Although there's more resources, Horton remembers the challenge he faced during the Labor Day 2020 fires, when the massively destructive Almeda Fire and South Obenchain Fire broke out. With all local resources battling the fires, he called Salem for help, but all of the state's resources were allocated to seven conflagrations across Oregon.</p><p>\"On that day there wasn't units,\" Horton said. \"There's more capacity in the state of Oregon now, so we hope to not have that vulnerability, but I would be remiss if I didn't say there's more room for us to go.</p><p>\"We still could use more units across the state,\" Horton added.</p><p>Reach web editor Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com\">nmorgan@rosebudmedia.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @MTwebeditor.</p><p>Correction Aug. 21: This story was updated with correct information about the Rum Creek Fire.

The South American nation's worst wildfires on record burnt more than 570,000 hectares (1,408,500 acres) and cost $350 million to combat, according to a report by Universidad de Chile's Center for Climate and Resilience released last week. The previous record was 130,000 hectares in 2015. The 2017 fires put about 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent into the atmosphere, close to the 111.6 million metric tons emitted by all of Chile the year before. </p><p>It would take cars in Santiago, home to about 7 million people, to run for 23 years to equal the emissions from the worst mega-fires. \"There are no magic solutions to these fires,\" said researcher Mauro Gonz\u00e1lez at the report's presentation in Santiago last week. \"We have a great challenge ahead because we can't manage climate change or meteorological conditions, so we need to focus on prevention.\" Last year saw the least rainfall on record in much of Chile, marking the completion of country's driest ever decade, a phenomenon linked to climate change that scientists have named a mega-drought. As global temperatures rise, extreme heat and lack of rain have worsened forest-fire episodes in other parts of the world such as California, Australia and the Amazon. Australia has lost 10 million hectares to the flames this session. Forests across the world will be increasingly vulnerable to wildfires and drought as global warming advances, according to an August report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Although total area burned globally has declined in recent decades, because of less burning of grasslands and savannahs, scientists found that higher temperatures have lengthened fire seasons over the past 40 years. -- Laura Millan Lombrana and Akshat Rathi, Bloomberg</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y63-MGB1-F0YC-P3TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"319\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX069</classCode><className>SANTIAGO, CHILE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC340</classCode><className>CHILE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Small brush fires were reported in several communities in the southern part of the state during the last week that were ignited by the careless disposal of hot wood ashes.</p><p>As New Hampshire continues to experience fluctuating weather conditions requiring the use of wood heat, it is important to be aware of the increasing fire danger and to practice proper disposal techniques for wood ash.</p><p>Fire officials recommend ashes be stored in a metal container with secured lid for several days with the container located outside and away from other combustibles. Wood ash is a good insulator of live embers that can easily come into contact with and ignite dry leaves and grasses, causing a wildfire.</p><p>\"It's very important for homeowners to be sure that ashes are completely cold before disposal; it only takes one hot ember to spark a wildfire,\" stated Steven Sherman, chief of the Forest Protection Bureau with the N.H. Division of Forests and Lands.</p><p>\"Every wildfire has the potential to cause property loss and serious injury that can easily be avoided,\" Sherman added. \"We ask that people make responsible decisions regarding fire use and comply with all applicable laws, rules and permitting requirements.\"</p><p>Open burning in New Hampshire is regulated by the Division of Forests and Lands, the Department of Environmental Services-Air Resources Division and local forest fire wardens.

Detroit public schools will probably require them unless everyone in a room is vaccinated. In Pittsburgh, masks will likely be required regardless of vaccination status. In some states, schools cannot mandate face coverings under any circumstances.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With COVID-19 cases soaring nationwide, school districts across the U.S. are yet again confronting the realities of a polarized country and the lingering pandemic as they navigate mask requirements, vaccine rules and social distancing requirements for the fast-approaching new school year.</p><p>The spread of the delta variant and the deep political divisions over the outbreak have complicated decisions in districts from coast to coast. In some conservative states, lawmakers banned districts from requiring masks despite outcry from medical professionals. Schools are weighing a variety of plans to manage junior high and middle school classrooms filled with both vaccinated and unvaccinated students.</p><p>\"I'm so frustrated that it's become a political issue because it shouldn't be. It's science,\" said Mary Tuttle, who operates an Indianapolis in-home day care center and hopes the city's schools require masks for her daughters.</p><p>She worries that the delta variant could lead to a return to virtual learning, which caused her 10-year-old daughter to become depressed and anxious last year. Another daughter will turn 12 six days after starting 6th grade and will be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p><p>Adding to the concerns is a rise in cases overall - sharply in some states, including Arkansas, which won't let schools require masks. Public health researchers on Tuesday called Arkansas' rapidly climbing infections and hospitalizations a \"raging forest fire,\" and the state's top health official warned of significant future outbreaks in schools.</p><p>Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, and it has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated.</p><p>In Mississippi, the leading health official said Tuesday that intensive care units are full in 13 hospitals because of a surge in cases, and he provided an ominous warning in one of the least vaccinated states in the country: \"Y'all, we're going to have a rough few weeks,\" Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.</p><p>Weekly tallies by the American Academy of Pediatrics based on state reports show that COVID-19 cases in kids increased nationally in July after a couple of months of declines. The most recent data shows a 1% increase from July 1 to July 15, representing 43,000 additional cases.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday recommended universal masking in schools, even for those who are vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month recommended mask-wearing indoors for students and staff who are not fully vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccine is not yet approved for children under 12. If it is shown to be safe and effective for younger ages, vaccine manufacturers could seek emergency authorization this fall or winter.</p><p>American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the fact that some states refuse to allow mask requirements \"is just plain wrong.\" She said the organization has embraced recommendations from the CDC.</p><p>But school officials say masking decisions have been complicated by conflicting advice from public health officials. School districts that can set their own policies are taking different approaches.</p><p>In Detroit public schools, everyone will likely be required to wear a mask unless an entire room is vaccinated. Officials are developing an identification system, perhaps by wearing lanyards, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said.</p><p>In Pittsburgh, administrators are proposing that all public school students and staff be required to wear masks indoors to protect younger students and because of \"concerns around unknowns from the variant,\" spokeswoman Ebony R. Pugh said. Universal masking also protects the privacy of older students who have not been vaccinated, she said.</p><p>In Kansas, most schoolchildren and teachers will not be required to wear masks. The state's largest district, Wichita, made masks optional starting July 6 and surveyed parents before announcing its reopening plan, said Wichita Public Schools spokeswoman Susan Arensman.</p><p>\"A lot of them, their big talking points were about the emotional well-being of students and staff,\" Arensman said. \"They still wanted kids to be safe, but they also wanted kids to be back to normal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10080696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:636F-FGY1-F039-F3TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 22, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Health Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzIwMkJBNkYzMUNBNDU5NTk5NTcxNTVDMzU2MjYwRTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Health Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDU0MzM3Mzg3QTM1NDRENThDNUIzNDJFOTc3MkM3NUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDQxNkZCNUM0Nzc0NEYwQkEwNDc5QUQxRTUzODEyNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Personal Appearance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDgzMTRDQzkxQ0JGNDgwMDlGM0M1MTE1OUE0Njc2MTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDNBQ0U5Q0Q5NEE4NERCQ0FDNzYxN0MzNUEzNTk5QjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002144</classCode><className>VACCINATION &amp;

Officials say the recent weather has left much of the county very dry.</p><p>\"We had a request for it from some of our fire chiefs,\" said Martin County Civil Defense Director Monty Wolfe. \"We are beginning to get calls for brush fire runs. Over the last couple of days, we had a couple of small burns that really took off. Without a lot of rain in the forecast over the next week we thought we'd go ahead and put a burn ban in place.\"</p><p>The commissioners did declare an emergency and the ban will remain in place for seven days or until the county gets more rain and then it could be lifted.</p><p>\"It is really dry,\" said Wolfe. \"We had a couple of fires where there were people watching them. They started out small, caught a gust of wind and just took off. If we have fires getting out of control with people watching them, what would happen with a fire no one was watching?\"</p><p>The ban carries all of the usual requirements. Campfires must be enclosed by a fire ring, no open burning or wood or combustible materials. No burning of debris, like timber, vegetation, construction waste or storm debris.</p><p>Charcoal and propane fires in grills are permitted, but charcoal must be extinguished completely and fireworks are discouraged.</p><p>\"We are probably a little more sensitive to brush fires because of the amount of forest land we have,\" said Wolfe. \"In Martin County almost every field leads to a woods. The last two fires were headed to a woods. We don't want to have to fight a forest fire if we can avoid it. I expect other counties around us to follow us before long.\"</p><p>Those dry conditions reported in Martin County don't seem to be happening in Daviess County.</p><p>\"I was surprised to see the burn ban in Martin County,\" said Daviess County Emergency Management Agency Director Scott Myers. \"I'm still mowing my grass. I don't think we are anywhere close to that here.\"</p><p>Myers says there have been no reports of field fires and no requests from area fire chiefs to put a burn ban in place.</p><p>\"The fire departments have not mentioned anything to me,\" said Myers. \"The corn is beginning to dry out, but it isn't that dry yet. I think we are fortunate. I guess we have had enough rain for now that we don't have a problem with dry conditions yet.\"</p><p>___ (c)2020 Washington Times-Herald (Washington, Ind.)

And while many factors can contribute to an event, we often single out only a few as its causes. So how do we decide?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the topic of a recent paper by Tadeg Quillien, a doctoral student in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. The study, published in the journal Cognition, outlines how a factor's role in an event influences whether or not we consider it to be a cause of that event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his paper, Quillien constructs a mathematical model of causal judgement that reproduces people's intuitions better than any previous model. And in addition to providing theoretical insights, understanding how we reason about causality has major implications for how we approach problems overall.</p><p>Intuitively speaking, the event that has the strongest role in determining an outcome is generally considered its cause. In fact, philosophers and psychologists have observed humans ranking the causes of an event in different studies. For instance, if a match is found at the scene of a forest fire, people usually say the match caused the blaze, even though the oxygen in the air was also necessary for the fire to start.</p><p>\"But what do we mean by 'the strongest role'?\" Quillien asked. \"This is still a very hazy notion, and making it more precise has, for decades, been a source of headaches for philosophers and psychologists trying to understand causal judgment.\"</p><p>Quillien approached this question by considering what evolutionary purpose our causal reasoning serves. \"At least one of the functions of causal judgement is to highlight the factors that are most useful in predicting an outcome,\" Quillien proposed, \"as well as the factors that you can manipulate to affect the outcome.\"</p><p>The process reminded him of a scientist seeking to understand how different phenomena are related. Scientists can run controlled experiments with many different cases to quantify correlations and determine an effect size, which is the association between one variable and another.</p><p>But if we accept that this is what the mind is trying to do, a problem arises. Scientists rely on many observations before arriving at a judgment. They can't compute an effect size from a single occurrence. And yet, people generally have no trouble making one-off causal judgements.</p><p>Quillien believes that this paradox can be resolved with the following hypothesis. When people make a causal judgment, they are unconsciously imagining the different ways that an event could have unfolded. \"These counterfactuals give you the data that you need in order to compute this measure of effect size,\" he said.</p><p>Guided by these ideas, Quillien designed a simple mathematical model of how people make causal judgments. To test his model, he analyzed data from an experiment conducted by Harvard psychologist Adam Morris and his colleagues. The experiment used a lottery game to explore the effect of probability and logical structure on people's causal intuitions.</p><p>Whose approval does Carl have to thank for his funding? It depends on the situation.</p><p>\"The probability of events affects our sense of causation in a strange way,\" Quillien explained. Say a professor, Carl, wants funding for a project. His request is reviewed by his department chairs, Alice and Bill, both of whom have to approve it. Alice approves nearly every application, but Bill is notorious for rejecting most of them. The question is, if Carl receives his funding, who's most responsible?</p><p>Most people would say Bill caused Carl's request to be approved, since getting his endorsement has more bearing, in general, on receiving funding.</p><p>However, change just one detail, and people's intuitions flip. If Carl only needs the approval of one or the other of his colleagues, and still gets both, then people attribute Carl's funding to Alice. In this case, her more reliable support was the strongest factor in whether Carl's project was funded.</p><p>In their experiment, Morris and his colleagues were able to precisely quantify this effect that an event's probability had on people's causal judgment. Their conclusion was surprising, and no psychological theory at the time could explain their results, Quillien said.</p><p>When he re-analyzed their data, Quillien found that his mathematical model closely matched how Morris's participants had assigned causality to the various events. In fact, it matched the data better than any other model to date.</p><p>The results highlight how probability and logical structure together inform our causal intuition. When both votes are necessary for Carl to get funding, it will happen only if the most stringent committee member is on board. As a result, people attribute a positive outcome to the less likely vote. By contrast, in situations where a single vote is enough, the approval of the more permissive faculty member is what most often determines the outcome. \"We are attuned to causes that tend to co-occur with the effects,\" Quillien said.</p><p>The way in which we reason about causality has practical implications. Consider the example of the forest fire again. Fires need three things to burn: oxygen, fuel and an ignition source. But our minds don't give these factors equal weight.</p><p>\"While we may not have an exact model of how forest fires work, we still have this sense that oxygen is there all the time, and the forests are not always on fire,\" Quillien said. \"So the correlation between oxygen and fire is relatively low.\" The same reasoning applies to the fuel, namely the wood in the trees. But introduce a match to the equation, and the forest is much more likely to catch ablaze.</p><p>The method of causal judgement that Quillien outlines in his work is good at guiding us toward the match: a factor with high predictive power that we might even be able to control. However, our intuition can sometimes lead us astray when we try to gain a more complete understanding of the world.</p><p>\"If you want a deep understanding of how fire works, you need to factor in the role of oxygen,\" Quillien said. \"But if your intuitive sense of causation is screaming at you that oxygen does not matter, then that might lead you to ignore some of the important factors in the world.\"</p><p>Causal reasoning is a ubiquitous feature of cognition, and Quillien plans to further investigate how our sense of causation influences other aspects of our psychology and worldview. \"We explain almost everything in terms of cause and effect,\" he said. \"As a consequence, many of the concepts that we use to make sense of the world have causation as a building block.\"</p><p>\"If we can understand the concept of causation, then we can potentially understand the way a lot of other concepts work as well.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124132025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61GX-4YS1-JCBF-S3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U56</classCode><className>HUMANITIES &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXT</classCode><className>BEHAVIOR &amp; COGNITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D8KZ</classCode><className>NEUROSCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001089</classCode><className>MATHEMATICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1WY</classCode><className>SANTA BARBARA, CA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In this way, less energy is needed to create an ignition because the temperature of the fuels is already elevated. Wind speed and direction and low relative humidity can also exacerbate these conditions, increasing probabilities for increased ignitions and fire spread,\" said Coates.</p><p>\"Drought and extreme heat may also lessen the defense mechanisms that trees and other vegetation might use to protect themselves from other potential disturbances, such as insects and pathogen,\" he said. \"Over time, vegetation may be more susceptible to the effects of these organisms, the vegetation may die, and subsequently new fuels may be added to a given location.\"</p><p>Coates is an assistant professor in the department of forest resources and environmental conservation, in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment.</p><p>\"In California and other areas, warm and dry conditions have been extended beyond the summer months and into autumn and early winter in some years,\" said Coates. \"This essentially extends our 'wildfire season' and provides increased chances for ignitions and conditions that are conducive to rapid fire spread.\"</p><p>\"It also taxes the resources - the people, equipment, money -- used to suppress wildfire ignitions. Many of those resources are also used to proactively manage fuels in many locations through the use of controlled and managed prescribed fire.\"</p><p>Dr. Coates maintains an active research program focused primarily on fire ecology. This includes elements of fire behavior, fuels, fire effects, silviculture, and restoration ecology.

(Operator Instructions) Mr. Dion Hatcher, you may begin your conference.</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER, PRESIDENT, VERMILION ENERGY INC.: Thank you, Samara. Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. I'm Dion Hatcher, President of Vermilion Energy. With me today are Lars Glemser, Vice President and CFO; Darcy Kerwin, Vice President, International and HSE; Bryce Kremnica, Vice President, North America; Jenson Tan, Vice President, Business Development; and Kyle Preston, Vice President, Investor Relations.</p><p>We'll be referencing a PowerPoint presentation to discuss our Q2 2022 results and our return of capital framework we announced this morning. Presentation can be found on our website under Invest With Us and Events &amp; Presentations. Please refer to our advisory on forward-looking statements at the end of the presentation. It describes forward-looking information, non-GAAP measures and oil and gas terms used today and outlines the risk factors and assumptions relevant to this discussion.</p><p>As shown on Slide 2, we delivered another quarter with record fund flows of $453 million and record free cash flow of $340 million, which is over $2.00 a share. That's up 16% and 12%, respectively, from the previous quarter. The increase was mainly driven by strong commodity prices as global oil prices and North American gas prices were strengthened during the quarter. European gas prices remained strong in Q2 and relatively consistent with the prior quarter with TTF in excess of CAD 38 per MMBtu. Over the past several months, European gas forward prices have nearly doubled, which will bode well for Vermilion. I will review the fundamental drivers for this later in my presentation.</p><p>Production during Q2 averaged 84,868 BOE a day, which is down slightly from the previous quarter, mainly due to planned and unplanned downtime. Key notable event during the quarter was the closing of the Leucrotta acquisition on May 31. We have successfully integrated the Leucrotta assets and some of the Mica asset team, which is now focused on completing a 6-well pad that was drilled in Q2. Very excited to have these high quality assets in our portfolio and look forward to scaling up our development.</p><p>The Leucrotta acquisition was mostly funded by free cash flow generated in the quarter. As a result, net debt increased only slightly in Q2 to $1.6 billion. However, our net debt to fund flow ratio decreased to 1.1x as a result of our increasing fund flows from operations. We remain on track to achieve our next debt target of $1.2 billion by the end of 2022. And with this clear line of sight, we are pleased to outline our return on capital framework.</p><p>Before I get into the details of our return of capital framework, Slide 3 reviews some of the key strategic objectives we accomplished over the last 2 years that will position Vermillion to deliver very strong returns over the long term. These objectives were part of the strategic plan we developed during the 2020 downturn.</p><p>Our number one financial priority was to reduce debt and strengthen the balance sheet. We have reduced debt by approximately $1 billion relative to Q2 2020 by the end of this year, while also funding over $1 billion of strategic acquisitions without issuing any equity. We increased our international weighting in European gas exposure through the Corrib acquisition, which we expect to close in Q4 this year. Our international assets now represent over 1/3 of our production base and contribute approximately 2/3 of our fund flow and free cash flow. This international diversification is what differentiates Vermilion from our peers.</p><p>We reinstated a base dividend in Q1 of this year, and today, we're excited to announce a 33% increase in our Q3 quarterly dividend to $0.08 per share. The dividend is very resilient at less than 3% of our fund flows and leaves ample home for ratable increases over time.</p><p>We completed the Leucrotta acquisition in Q2. This Mica asset significantly increases the depth and quality of our North American inventory, which will further enhance our free cash flow profile and underpin our long-term return of capital.</p><p>And finally, we said that we would increase our return of capital when we achieved the line of sight to our $1.2 billion mid-cycle debt target. With less than 2 quarters remaining in 2022 and robust outlook for 2023, let me now return -- review the return of capital framework on Slide 4. Vermilion has a long history of returning capital to its shareholders. In the past, this has been primary through base dividends, which we've delivered over $40 a share. Going forward, base dividends will remain a key component of our return of capital framework. However, we want to ensure the base dividend is resilient over the long term through the commodity cycles while allowing for ratable increases over time where they place a burden on our business or the balance sheet. With this philosophy in mind, we plan to limit the annual base dividend outlay to approximately 10% of our mid-cycle fund flows. For reference, this would equate to approximately $100 million based on the current asset base, but could increase if our asset base grows or if we see a fundamental shift in our mid-cycle commodity price assumptions.</p><p>In conjunction with our Q2 release, we announced a 33% increase to our Q3 quarterly dividend to CAD 0.08 per share. This equates to an annual dividend of CAD 0.32 per share, or approximately $53 million based on the current number of shares outstanding. At this dividend per share level, we have the capacity to increase base dividend, and we look forward to provide ratable increases over time.</p><p>With our debt approaching target levels, we will pivot from allocating free cash flow for debt reduction to the return of capital. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a core principle of Vermillion, and we will remain focused on that going forward. We plan to enhance our return of capital to shareholders going forward while continuing to reduce debt to a target of $850 million by the end of 2023, which implies approximately another $350 million of further debt reduction beyond our year end 2022 target. It also implies we will be undrawn on our $1.6 billion credit facility, leaving just our termed U.S. notes outstanding.</p><p>The amount of free cash flow available for return of capital will increase as debt levels decrease based on the illustrative grid outlined on Slide 4. The grid is not intended to be prescriptive quarter-to-quarter, but will be used as a tool to guide near-term return of capital allocation decisions, while taking into account other capital requirements such as further debt reduction, asset retirement obligations and acquisitions. As you can see from this grid and near-term debt targets I discussed, a significant portion of our future free cash flow will be available to the return to shareholders.</p><p>Based on our return of capital allocation grid, recent commodity strip and internal estimates, we anticipate returning up to 25% of free cash flow in the second half of 2022, and up to 50% to 75% of free cash flow in 2023, while achieving our debt targets. Our goal is to return capital in the most beneficial method to shareholders. We will consider various options to return capital, including share buybacks through the normal course issuer bid, regular and special dividends and a potential substantial issuer bid.</p><p>Based on our review of a number of data points, we will initially allocate the vast majority of this capital return to share buybacks. Given the structural improvements in our business, combined with the strong fundamental outlook for global commodities, we believe Vermilion is very well positioned to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead. However, we do not believe this value proposition is accurately reflected in our share price today. And therefore, at this time, we view share buybacks as the most compelling use of free cash flow that will benefit long-term shareholders.</p><p>In early July, we announced the approval of our normal course issuer bid for the purchase of up to 16 million common shares, representing approximately 10% of Vermilion's public float. To date, we have repurchased 1.25 million common shares for $35 million. As we reduce our share count, this will also enhance our ability to increase the base dividend while adhering to our annual dollar limit of 10% mid-cycle fund flows. We look forward to providing continued updates on our return of capital initiatives through the second half of this year and throughout 2023 as we carefully weigh capital allocation decisions against various uses of excess free cash flow with a view of acting in the long-term interest of our shareholders.</p><p>Slide 5 is from our Investor Relations presentation where we provide an updated financial outlook for 2022 based on the actuals to date and our estimates for the balance of the year using the current commodity strip. As you can see, on a pro forma basis, including the full year impact from the Corrib acquisition, we are forecasting pro forma fund flows of $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion, or approximately $11 per share. We also show our year end debt target of $1.2 billion, which incorporates the return of upwards of 25% of free cash flow in the second half of this year.</p><p>We have not yet provided any formal guidance for 2023, but if you assume production is held flat at our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 BOE a day, and you honor the backwardation in the commodity price forward strips, we are looking at generating similar amounts of free cash flow in 2023, which is consistent with the analysts' estimates.</p><p>As outlined on Slide 6, looking at our cumulative free cash flow over a 3-year period from 2022 through to 2024, assuming flat production from our existing asset base and applying the forward pricing, we expect Vermilion to generate over $5 billion of free cash flow over this time, represented by the blue bars. This amount of free cash flow is equal to our current market capitalization. The gray bars show the cumulative free cash flow we currently plan to allocate to debt reduction. And as you can see, the majority of the free cash flow was allocated to debt reduction in 2022, including the funding of over $1 billion of acquisitions, whereas for 2023 and 2024, we will pivot and majority of the free cash flow will be available for return of capital to shareholders now that we have a much stronger balance sheet.</p><p>As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, the fundamentals for European gas are very strong. Slide 7 shows historical pricing of European gas and Asian LNG, which have traded in a similar band since 2015 compared to the Canadian benchmark price of AECO. The blue bars represent the average premium that Vermilion receives on its total gas sales relative to AECO. This premium was approximately $6 per mcf in 2021 and is forecast to be approximately $19 in 2022. We also show the forward pricing for the balance of 2022 and 2023, which has increased significantly from historical levels. Second half 2022 TTF is $75 per MMBtu, and 2023 is now over CAD 70 per MMBtu. For every dollar increase in Euro gas prices, this adds an incremental $37 million of fund flows to Vermillion on an annual unhedged basis.</p><p>Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people, and our hope is that a negotiated settlement can reach you quickly. The tragic events in Ukraine are undoubtedly contributing to the price increase, however, the underlying fundamental drivers for high European gas prices were in place prior to the invasion.</p><p>Chart on Slide 8 shows the 2023 and 2024 forward price for TTF and how much it has increased since the beginning of the year. Calendar year 2023 TTF price has increased from under $20 at the beginning to year to over $60 today. This will have a significant impact on Vermilion's fund flows in 2023, and we have been adding more European hedges in 2023 in recent weeks. We believe the structural drivers will be supportive for European gas prices for many years to come. Europe consumes approximately 45 to 50 Bcf a day of natural gas with approximately 40% of that being supplied from Russia in 2021. Recent events, EU is now trying to significantly reduce its dependence on Russian gas.</p><p>EU recognized natural gas as a transition fuel, which we believe will help facilitate the permitting and development of domestic supplies over time as countries increase use of natural gas for power generation. Examples of this transition include Germany shutting down nuclear and accelerating the phaseout of coal from 2038 to 2030, and Ireland committing to build 9 gas-fired power generators by 2024.</p><p>With domestic supply in Europe continuing to decline, the only viable option to replace Russian gas is to increase LNG imports. But there is limited new LNG supply coming on the market prior to 2025 and 2026. These new projects require significant and longer term contracts, significant capital. So in order to attract LNG to Europe, buyers need to compete with Asia, which is driving European gas prices even higher. Short term, we expect Asian LNG demand to increase as they look to build inventories prior to this winter, but more importantly, mid to longer term, Asian demand for LNG is forecast to significantly increase.</p><p>As I mentioned, we are starting to layer in more 2023 European gas hedges to lock in some of our fund flows at these higher prices. As shown on Slide 9, since our last update, we have increased our 2023 Euro gas hedge position from 32% to 45%. Those recent hedges were executed primarily with wide collars with an average floor of about $40 and ceiling of about $70. Due to the higher gas prices, we may further increase our 2023 Euro gas hedge position to 60% to lock in even more fund flows. At the corporate level, given our low debt levels and current outlook, we tend on keeping our total hedge percentage at the lower end of our target range of 25% to 50%, which will leave us with the exposure to sustain higher oil prices.</p><p>Going back to our Q2 results, we have provided a brief summary of our operational highlights on Slide 10 and 11. The most notable activity in our international operations in Q2 was our offshore drilling program in Australia. This program was scheduled to start early in the second quarter, but was delayed approximately 1 month due to unexpected maintenance and repairs on a third party contracted rig. During routine inspection prior to moving the rig to our location, the operator identified some maintenance requirements and had to mobilize the rig to Singapore for repairs. We commenced drilling late in the second quarter, and drilling operations are progressing. However, the delay did result in some deferred production and higher costs. We expect to finish drilling in early September, and we'll start the wells shortly thereafter.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Europe as the teams focused their efforts on preparing for our second half 2022 drilling campaign, which will include 2 wells in the Netherlands, 3 wells in Hungary and 2 wells in Croatia.</p><p>Subsequent to the quarter, a forest fire near our Cazaux field in Southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels of production being temporary shut in. Our staff in France worked closely with emergency responders to ensure the safety and security of our employees, our contractors and installations, assuring there were no HSE incidents. We're in the process of making the necessary repairs and bringing this production back online, however, this will have an impact on our France production in the second half of 2022.</p><p>It was a relatively quiet quarter in Canada as drilling and completion activities in West Central Alberta, Southeast Saskatchewan was limited during the second quarter due to spring breakup. Following the announcement of the Leucrotta acquisition in late March, we summoned our Mica asset team and focused on integrating the assets and working closely with the Leucrotta team in drilling the first 6-well Montney pad. Drilling was successfully completed during the second quarter, and the team is now focused on completion activities that is progressing as per plan.</p><p>In the U.S., we drilled 4 wells of our planned 6 operated Turner wells and completed 2 wells during the second quarter. One well was brought on production during the second quarter, where the remaining wells will be completed and brought on production during the third quarter. Overall results to date are in line with expectations. Subsequent to the quarter, we successfully executed drilling and completion activities on 3 2-mile laterals, which are significantly more economic than the 1-mile laterals.</p><p>Moving to Slide 12. Our Q3 2022 capital program is well underway, and in Europe, we will start our drilling campaign later this month and continue through the fourth quarter. As mentioned, the forest fire near our Cazaux field in Southern France resulted in approximately 1,500 barrels a day of production being temporary shut-in, and we expect to have most of it back online by the end of the year.</p><p>Looking at our Q3 production forecast, we will benefit from a full quarter of contribution from the Leucrotta acquisition and new production from the U.S.-Southeast Saskatchewan drilling programs, partially offset by the Australia drilling program delay and fire-related downtime in France. Taking all this into account, we expect Q3 production to be in line with Q2.</p><p>As a result of the forest fire-related downtime in France, offshore drilling delays in Australia, combined with inflationary pressure, we are increasing our 2022 capital budget by $50 million to $550 million. We are maintaining our annual production guidance of 86,000 to 88,000, excluding the Corrib acquisition volumes. We plan to update our production guidance once we have greater certainty on the timing of the Corrib close, which we expect to occur in Q4. Our exit rate forecast of 95,000 to 100,000 BOE a day, including Corrib acquisition volumes, remains unchanged.</p><p>Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to make some closing remarks on our upcoming leadership changes. As we announced earlier this year, Vermillion's Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Lorenzo Donadeo, will be retiring from the company effective September 1. Lorenzo was instrumental in creating what Vermilion is today, along with creating significant value for our shareholders during his tenure. On behalf of the full organization. I would like to thank Lorenzo for his leadership and guidance of the company over the 27 years. He will be greatly missed by everyone at Vermilion. But if anyone deserves a long, happy and fulfilling retirement, it is Lorenzo. We wish you all the best, and we look forward to providing you regular quarterly updates as a meaningful shareholder of Vermilion for many years to come.</p><p>As previously announced, Mr. Bob Michaleski will assume the role of Independent Chairman on Lorenzo's departure. Bob has 41 years of experience and oversaw Pembina's transformation from an Alberta-based oil company into one of North America's leading integrated energy transition service companies. He served as the President and CEO of Pembina for 13 years. He joined Vermilion Board in 2016 and was pointed as Chair of the Audit Committee in 2020. Vermilion's executive committee structure will continue and will fill the role -- we will fill the role of the chief executive officer. It will be led by myself and will include all the existing members.</p><p>Well, that concludes my prepared remarks. And with that said, we'd like to open it up for questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Menno Hulshof with TD Securities.</p><p>MENNO HULSHOF, RESEARCH ANALYST, TD SECURITIES EQUITY RESEARCH: I'll start with a question on Corrib. If we assume that it does close, what is your best guess in terms of the purchase price, net of accrued free cash flow? We've run some numbers on this end, and our estimate is very low. But any thoughts here would be helpful.</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Menno. I'm going to pass it over to Lars to address that one.</p><p>LARS WILLIAM GLEMSER, VP &amp; CFO, VERMILION ENERGY INC.: Menno, I think you're thinking about it the right way in terms of cash to close at December 31 of this year from a modeling perspective, and then obviously full access to the cash flows in 2023. I think the number that is good to use for year end this year would be a purchase price of CAD 100 million to CAD 150 million, if it were to close at the end of 2022. And that would be inclusive of the contingent payment that is in the money for 2023, which was USD 25 million. So I think that's the best way to model it and a good way in terms of how you're thinking about it.</p><p>MENNO HULSHOF: Terrific. And then on acquisitions, in the past you've talked about smaller Euro gas packages potentially becoming available. And I know there are limits to what you can say here. But like at a high level, what are the boxes that need to be checked to pull the trigger on another Euro package? And do you see these opportunities being able to compete with buybacks at the current share price?</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Menno. I'll pass it back to Lars to address how we're thinking about that relative to our return of capital framework.</p><p>LARS WILLIAM GLEMSER: Yes. Thanks, Dion. And maybe I'll just rewind a little bit, Menno. With the return of capital grid, what we really wanted to do was shift focus back to the $11 per share of free cash flow that we're generating. Dion mentioned $1.8 billion of free cash flow in 2022. That's on a pro forma basis. That's probably not a bad proxy to think about free cash flow for 2023. And then what the return of capital grid is going to do is create discipline in terms of where we are allocating capital. There's flexibility in there in terms of how we return capital at this point in time. We'll be doing it through share buybacks.</p><p>And as importantly, in terms of acquisitions, when it comes to North America, nothing big. We think that we have done the heavy lifting in terms of high-grading the inventory here in North America. It'll be more tuck-in bolt-ons in terms of our existing position within North America. And then Europe, I think we've had good success, a good track record there of making acquisitions. Now that those acquisitions will continue to compete with returning capital to shareholders, we will be looking for, I'd call it, deep value type opportunities in Europe as we move forward here. Some acquis -- sorry, some announcements have been made in the past in terms of potential opportunities in jurisdictions like Netherlands. But again, it's going to have to be competitive in terms of where we return capital.</p><p>OPERATOR: We'll take our next question from Greg Pardy with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>GREG M. PARDY, MD &amp; CO-HEAD GLOBAL ENERGY RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Dion and Lorenzo, just all the very best in your -- I guess it's your second shot at your retirement. A couple -- maybe just one maybe modeling question is what kind of book tax rate should we sort of think about on a consolidated basis? And Lars, I want to ask that, just that tax question. Is it still, I don't know, 11%, 12% or so pre-tax?</p><p>LARS WILLIAM GLEMSER: Yes. So I think for 2022 -- and I'll sort of correlate these tax rates to the pro forma numbers. So we're referencing $2.4 billion of cash flow for 2022. In the context of that, 10% to 11% is still a good way to think about it, Greg. For 2023, I would say that rate has gone up in the context of current strip pricing. I would sort of peg it at 13% to 15% for full year 2023.</p><p>GREG M. PARDY: Okay. What about book? Sort of like 30-odd percent or so, just as a book tax rate?</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Sorry, could you repeat that, Greg?</p><p>GREG M. PARDY: Yes, just your book tax rate, what would you sort of be thinking? I know you're giving me the cash taxes, but just as a book tax rate?</p><p>LARS WILLIAM GLEMSER: Yes. So I think a good way to think about it is in the 30% range.</p><p>GREG M. PARDY: Okay. Okay. Great. And maybe just sort of related to Menno's question. With Europe now kind of thinking very differently about gas as a transition fuel, as you mentioned, are there -- are you -- are policymakers or governments now starting to come to you as one of the long-standing developers in Europe in terms of just encouraging domestic supply growth as opposed to just relying upon imports?</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Greg. I'll take this one. I think what's happening when you look over the last several quarters with the crisis, and I believe it is an energy crisis in Europe, the policymakers have triaged their approach with starting with LNG, which is material, albeit a longer timeline. Next there's been discussions around offshore. And that leads us to your question around onshore. And so yes, we are having continued engagement in both Netherlands and Germany in particular. Questions that would be framed around what could Vermilion as an operator in some of those jurisdictions for decades be able to offer with increased activity?</p><p>What we've done, we always focus on what we can control. So we've added staff in both Netherlands and Germany, technical staff to be able to prepare for higher levels of activity. I would caution that time lines are longer in Europe. And so the time from a conversation to action and drills is longer. But I would say it's encouraging and somewhat logical that you would see some increased activity associated with the current situation and need for more domestic supply from responsible producers like Vermilion.</p><p>OPERATOR: And we'll take our next question from Patrick O'Rourke with ATB Capital Market.</p><p>PATRICK JOSEPH O'ROURKE, MD OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH FOR JUNIOR AND MID-CAP EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, ATB CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Congratulations to Lorenzo. Obviously, a long and well-storied career here at Vermilion. So, appreciative of all of your work. Guys, maybe just to build on Greg's question there. You talked about sort of the regulatory regime and time lines in Europe. As we get into the 2023 budgeting cycle and as you look at the portfolio, sort of what are the other hurdles to bringing on production in Europe? Where could you allocate capital to sort of capture this windfall gas price that we're seeing over there in sort of the quickest manner? Is it in the Netherlands? Is it in the CEE? What are sort of the infrastructure constraints? I don't think that you would have any in the Netherlands there.</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Well, thanks, Patrick. I think first of all, the acquisition with Corrib to bring on that 7,700 BOE a day, it's probably the most impactful thing. That in hindsight was very well timed, and we're excited to close that at the end of this year. So again, that's 7,700 BOE there. From an organic point of view, we're focused on every BU to look for opportunities. I think in Germany, we do have a deep inventory of drilling prospects that, again, we've added resources back to look at some of the more, I would say, larger targets, but a little more higher risk. So that's something we're reviewing. CEE is an area, once we get these permits in place like SA-10, we're able to follow through and drill wells in shorter time lines. And then Netherlands, we used to drill 4 to 6 wells in the Netherlands. We're drilling 2 in the second half this year. So our view would be less work back to those higher levels of activities.</p><p>So I would say all jurisdictions, Netherlands does have the potential to increase activity as well as Germany. We drilled 3 wells earlier this year. And we're looking at on the gas side, what we might be able to do in late 2023 and into 2024. So quite excited to be having those conversations. And again, our near-term focus is getting more staff in those BUs to be able to react once it aligns with the regulatory framework to be able to put more capital into those business units.</p><p>PATRICK JOSEPH O'ROURKE: Okay. And then maybe shifting over to the return of capital framework here, and in particular the dividend. You guys referred to ratable dividend increases. The pro forma math that we have on today's dividend increase would sort of be sub-4% of 2023 free cash flow. So I wonder in terms of -- maybe you can provide some goalposts around what you mean with respect to ratable, and also sort of the cadence or review period, like how frequently you plan to review the dividend going forward here.</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: So I'll pass that one to Lars to talk about our thoughts on the base dividend.</p><p>LARS WILLIAM GLEMSER: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. The way we have framed the base dividend component is look to not exceed 10% of our cash flows at mid-cycle pricing. And I think that's some discipline that we want to continue to have in the business to ensure that, that base dividend is resilient. Based on our current numbers with the increase today, we're about $50 million to fund the increased dividend that we did announce today. So that is where there is ample room to continue increasing that and still be in line with our not to exceed 10%.</p><p>Now in terms of the cadence or how we will do that, I would say at this point, we're looking for ratable type increases over time. We think that also with the return of capital framework that we announced today, there is flexibility in terms of how we return that capital. The base dividend will be one mechanism that we use or one medium that we use. It will not be the majority of capital that will be returned through that. So that's where we have flexibility in terms of share buybacks, variable dividends, special dividends. We will err towards buybacks at this point in time just based on the data points that we're reviewing where we think capital is best allocated.</p><p>So hopefully that provides a little bit of clarity in terms of the fixed base dividend will be one component of our return of capital. But we truly want to make sure that, that base dividend is fixed and resilient in prices that are much lower than what we're seeing today.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). We'll take our next question from Josef Schachter with Schachter Energy Research.</p><p>JOSEF I. SCHACHTER, AUTHOR &amp; PRESIDENT, SCHACHTER ENERGY RESEARCH SERVICES INC.: In Europe, we're seeing a lot of demand management. U.K. talking about preparing for blackouts. Germany telling certain industries, you may get cut back certain percentages of gas, assuming the Russians are aggressive in terms of cutting back. Is there anything going on, on the supply management side where they're asking you to hold back and put into storage near consuming areas, gas to bring on later? Or if you have new wells coming on, bring them on close to the winter? Is there any supply management stuff going on that would impact your Vermilion in Q3, Q4 and into Q1 of next year?</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Josef, I'll take that one. The quick answer is no. We're selling all the gas that we're producing, and there's no discussions around us storing or restricting our production.</p><p>JOSEF I. SCHACHTER: Okay. Good. That should do it.</p><p>ANTHONY HATCHER: Thanks, Josef. With that, I think that -- I think we have no more questions. So I guess, Samara, we would like to thank everyone again for participating in our Q2 conference call and look forward to future updates.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. And this concludes today's call.

The 569-square-mile Bootleg Fire is burning 300 miles southeast of Portland in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest, a vast expanse of old-growth forest, lakes and wildlife refuges. Evacuations and property losses have been minimal compared with much smaller blazes in densely populated areas of California. But eyeing how the Bootleg Fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201d fueled by extreme weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201d keeps growing by miles each day, officials with the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in southwest Oregon are asking for more outside crews to be ready should there be a surge in fire activity there. </p><p>\"Although the lightning activity predicted for early this week is expected to occur east of us, we are prepared for the worst, and hoping for the best,\" Mike McCann, an assistant fire staff member, said yesterday in a statement released by the national forest. The worry is that dry conditions, a drought and the recent record-breaking heat wave in the region have created tinderbox conditions, so resources like fire engines are being recruited from places like Arkansas, Nevada and Alaska. Meanwhile, to the east, the Bootleg Fire's jaw-dropping size contrasted to its relatively small impact on people underscores the vastness of the American West and offers a reminder that Oregon, which is larger than Britain, is still a largely rural state, despite being known mostly for its largest city, Portland. If the fire were in densely populated parts of California, \"it would have destroyed thousands of homes by now,\" said James Johnston, a researcher with Oregon State University's College of Forestry who studies historical wildfires. \"But it is burning in one of the more remote areas of the Lower 48 states. It's not the Bay Area out there.\" At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and another 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have gone up in flames. Thick smoke chokes the area where residents and wildlife alike have already been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. No one has died. Pushed by strong winds from the southwest, the fire is spreading rapidly to the north and east, advancing toward an area that's increasingly remote. Evacuation orders on the fire's southern edge, closer to more populous areas like Klamath Falls and Bly, have been lifted or relaxed as crews gain control. Now it's small, unincorporated communities like Paisley and Long Creek \u00e2\u20ac\u201d both with fewer than 250 people \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and scattered homesteads that are in the crosshairs. But as big as the Bootleg Fire is, it's not the biggest Oregon has seen. The fire's size so far puts it fourth on the list of the state's largest blazes in modern times, including rangeland fires, and second on the list of infernos specifically burning in forest. These megafires usually burn until the late fall or even early winter, when rain finally puts them out. The largest forest fire in modern history was the Biscuit Fire, which torched nearly 780 square miles in 2002 in the Rogue River\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSiskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California. The Bootleg Fire was about 30% contained as of late yesterday. Yesterday flames forced the evacuation of a wildlife research station as firefighters had to retreat for the ninth consecutive day due to erratic and dangerous fire behavior. Sycan Marsh hosts thousands of migrating and nesting birds and is a key research station on wetland restoration in the upper reaches of the Klamath Basin. The Bootleg Fire was one of many fires burning in a dozen states, most of them in the West. Sixteen large uncontained fires burned in Oregon and Washington alone yesterday. And in Northern California, authorities expanded evacuations on the Tamarack Fire in Alpine County in the Sierra Nevada to include the mountain town of Mesa Vista. That fire, which exploded over the weekend and forced the cancellation of an extreme bike ride, was 61 square miles with no containment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017ac3ffd441af7affff80530000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D1-BF01-DY7N-F4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 20, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Laura Richardson, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, met with President Petro on a visit to Colombia, September 5-9, 2022[1]. <br/>NATO recently expanded to Sweden and Finland, has been de facto[2] incorporated in Ukraine, and may extend to Georgia. Now, NATO's entry into the Amazon is in the works under the aegis of newly elected President Gustavo Petro of Colombia. </p><p><br/>NATO[3] is a primary instrument of US imperial dominion. It is Washington's praetorian guard projected on a global scale. <br/>Earlier this month, President Petro invited[4] US and NATO military forces into the Amazon on the pretext that the imperial war machine could be repurposed as 'police' aimed at protecting the environment instead of the old ruse of the war on drugs. He proposed deployment of US Black Hawk helicopters to put out fires. Previous to the environmental alibi, the pretext for militarization of the jungle was narcotics interdiction. <br/>Petro described[5] his 'conversation with NATO' as 'strange,' but hastened to add 'that's where we are.' He legitimized the US military occupation of Colombia -a reported[6] nine bases - as 'more of a police unit than a military unit.' Incredulously, he claimed that the continued occupation was a 'complete change in what US military aid has always been.' <br/>NATO in Colombia<br/>Colombia has been the poster child for the Monroe Doctrine - an assertion of US hegemony over the hemisphere dating back to 1823 - and the leading client state of the US in the Americas. The South American nation was touted by both Hillary Clinton[7] and Joe Biden[8] in their US presidential campaigns as a model for the rest of Latin America. <br/>In 2017, Colombia became one of NATO's Global Partners[9] and its first in Latin American. In February, Colombia conducted a provocative joint naval drill[10] with NATO near Venezuela, which included a nuclear submarine. <br/>Then on March 10, Colombia became a 'Major Non-NATO Ally[11]' of the US, giving Colombia special access to military programs. Biden explained: 'This is a recognition of the unique and close relationship between our countries.' <br/>From August 26 to September 11, US and Colombian militaries conducted joint NATO exercises[12]. During this period, US Army General Laura Richardson, commander of the US Southern Command, made a five-day visit to meet with the newly elected president. The general gushed[1] about 'our number one security partner in the region,' describing Colombia as the 'linchpin to the whole southern hemisphere.' <br/>The South-Com commander also met with Colombian Vice President Francia Mrquez to discuss implementation of the hemispheric 'Women, Peace, and Security' initiative. Richardson concluded that the 'Western Hemisphere is largely free and secure because of Colombia's stabilizing efforts.' <br/>When Petro first came into office, he differed from the US/NATO stance on the US proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, advocating a neutral negotiated peace[13] on September 21. Two weeks later he switched, joining the US-led resolution in the Organization of American States strongly condemning[14] Russia's 'unprovoked invasion' and unilaterally demanding Russian withdrawal. <br/>Green-washing of NATO in the Amazon<br/>Legitimizing foreign military intervention into the Amazon region under the guise of environmentalism is not a new idea. Little concerned about the niceties of national sovereignty, Al Gore told[15] the US Senate in 1989: 'The Amazon is not their property. It belongs to all of us.' <br/>More recently in 2019 and in response to fires in the BrazilianAmazon, French President Emmanuel Macron imperiously urged[16] the G7 nations to intervene: 'It is an international crisis.' UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres echoed Macron's sentiment, as did political leaders of other former colonial powers such as Germany. <br/>Quora rhetorically asked: 'Why doesn't NATO invade Brazil in order to save the Amazon?' Touting 'foreign action,' the NATO Association of Canada argued: 'Environmental security threats such as the fires in the Amazon rainforest affect the global environment, and therefore require a system of collective security to address them.' <br/>Combatting forest fires and other climate-driven disasters have been incorporated[17] into NATO's ever expanding scope[18]. The militarists are not so much concerned about the environment as they are about perturbances that can upset the existing world order. <br/>Because NATO is an accessory of the US empire, these new ecological tasks are best understood not as non-military functions but as the militarization of environmentalism. Their environmentally 'woke' missions operate under such cover as the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme[17] and even the UN Environmental Programme[19], which cooperates with NATO. <br/>Accordingly, Foreign Policy favorably considered[20] the 'militarization of the Amazon' on environmental grounds. A subsequent FP article on who will invade the Amazon predicted[21]: 'It's only a matter of time until major powers try to stop climate change by any means necessary.' <br/>Colombia - no longer an automatic US proxy <br/>Notwithstanding his opening the door for US/NATO into the Amazon, Colombian President Petro has other non-military climate-change solutions in mind. In his UN address, Petro warned[22], 'wars have served as an excuse for not ending the climate crisis.' <br/>While oil producing nations such as the US, UK, and Norway are increasing extraction[23], Petro is going in the opposite direction. His proposed[24] oil and coal tax to reduce production and fund social projects, ban on fracking, and especially the politically provocative unwinding of fuel subsidies could, however, cause further devaluation of the peso[25] and public discontent. <br/>Petro asked[26] a recent US congressional delegation to Colombia to intervene with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to forgive some of Colombia's debt in exchange for investment in decarbonized economies. That would compensate, he explained, for the disruption of the world economy caused with US unilateral coercive measures (i.e., sanctions). Petro elaborated[26] in a recent speech: 'The US is practically ruining all the economies of the world.' <br/>Petro also requested[26] that the US congressional delegation consider footing the bill for deeding three million hectares of land to campesinos as part of his administration's land-reform effort. The alternative, Petro adroitly suggested, would be to engage the US's geopolitical rival China more fully in his energy transition initiatives. <br/>Bloomberg reports[27] that China has already concluded a number of significant renewable energy infra-structure deals with Colombia. Indicative of the shifting balance of trade, Colombia imported $14.8 billion from China compared to $14.1 billion from the US in 2021. <br/>Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos had boasted[28] in 2013 in reference to Colombia's regional role as a US client state: 'If somebody called my country the Israel of Latin America, I would be very proud. I admire the Israelis, and I would consider that as a compliment.' A decidedly new message is coming from President Petro, who is on record saying[26] the US 'does not love us.' <br/>Indeed, Petro has made international headlines criticizing[29] the US war-on-drugs policy, noting that while Colombia may have historically been the supplier of illicit narcotics, the US bears responsibility for being the biggest consumer. Further, from being Washington's stand-in for destabilizing Venezuela, Colombia has flipped[30] to making amends with its immediate neighbor and reestablishing amiable diplomatic relations. <br/>Petro's problematic association with George Soros <br/>The right-wing accuses Petro of being a protg[31] of and financed[31] by billionaire George Soros, whose Open Society Foundation[32] has long been active in Colombia. Petro is portrayed[33] by those elements 'as manifesting that ideological trajectory of which George Soros is often seen as the patriarch.' Although reviled by the right, the obsessively[34] anti-communist 'puppet master of humanitarian imperialism[35]' is no friend of left. <br/>Even though Petro tried to distance himself from Soros in a tweet[36] calling him a 'speculative capitalist,' the new president met[37] with Soros's son and vice president of the foundation shortly after assuming the presidency to discuss joint ventures in the Amazon. <br/>Petro's predicament - a small country in the shadow of the US hegemon <br/>Now that the right-wing associated with former President lvaro Uribe has been discredited[38] and electorally defeated, US imperialism needs a new face in Colombia. Petro's ambiguous positions are best understood in historical context. For the first time in two centuries, putative leftists have run and lived to assume the presidency of Colombia, a country which has not only been a client state of the US but its lead proxy. <br/>Their win is an essential step in the long struggle to free their troubled country from its erstwhile subjugation to the colossus to the north. But it must be emphasized that it is nave to believe that Washington is about to allow such a seismic shift to the left to endure uncontested. <br/>Given the domination of Colombia by its US-backed military, Petro was concerned not only about winning the election but surviving afterward. Both Petro[39] and his running mate Mrquez[40] survived assassination attempts on the campaign trail. Even the Voice of America warned about the 'specter of assassination[39].' <br/>The new president of Colombia is a former leftist guerilla, who has shifted toward the center politically. But in comparison to the far-right rule of Uribe and his successors in Colombia, the election of Petro and his vice president Mrquez constitutes a sea change in the progressive direction. <br/>The regional movement[41] towards integration and independence poses a challenge to the US drive to impose its hegemony in the Americas. The change in the executive of Colombia further advances this movement. But Petro has inherited major institutional constraints and is subject to enormous pressures. <br/>Paradoxically, the very conditions that Petro campaigned against, which swept him into office, have now become his puzzles to solve. Strong inflationary winds[42] are buffeting society, generated by global economies with which small countries like Colombia must integrate but over which they have minimal control. As the cost of living goes up, Petro's popular support[43] at home suffers erosion. <br/>Petro's predicament is being caught between the popular demand for progressive change and the legacy of US imperial domination. Colombia will need to find the means to resist the further projection of US military command in the form of NATO. The Amazon doesn't need arsonists to put out its fires.

Frequent, low-intensity fire is essential for restoring public lands and the communities who depend on them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As snow melts and access opens to burn units, we will be taking advantage of favorable weather conditions to start prescribed burning where we can safely do so. No one knows what the fire season may bring, so it is important for us to be proactive when we have these springtime burning opportunities,\" said Forest Fire Management Officer Rob Allen.</p><p>Just over 9,500 acres of prescribed burning is planned this spring, but not all planned acres may be completed if conditions are not favorable. Conditions include correct temperature, wind, fuel moisture, and ventilation for smoke. When these criteria are met, firefighters implement, monitor, and patrol each burn to ensure it meets forest health and public safety goals including air quality.</p><p>\"These prescribed fire projects reduce the amount of burnable fuels in the forest, improve forest health, and help lower the risk of future high-intensity wildfires that are more likely to bring dense smoke and impact access to and use of the forest,\" Allen said.</p><p>Residents and visitors can expect to see and smell some smoke during burning operations. Even though smoke from prescribed fire is usually light and doesn't last long, it is important that smoke-sensitive individuals plan ahead and be prepared.

While the fire is contained to one acre, it continues to burn deep in the duff, creating concerns of creeping and smoldering fire beneath the forest floor.</p><p>Paul Clement, Assistant Fire Management Officer with the Forest Service, noted that current weather patterns have left the forest more dry than usual. \"Normally we have more humid conditions this time of year, which lowers the potential for wildfire to burn vertically downward. However, the lack of rain has dried out the mossy and predominantly humus areas (organic matter, leaf litter, and duff), contributing to the fire behavior burning into deep pockets of dried organic matter,\" Clement said.</p><p>Areas like these can be stubborn to extinguish. Clement stated that the fire can burn beneath leaf litter and other debris, igniting root systems of dead trees, burning out pockets of dried materials and creating additional hazards to firefighting resources. \"A fire can pop up outside of the containment lines from underground and carry the fire into more fuel,\" Clement said.</p><p>Forest Service Fire Management Officer Craig Kostrzewski reported that fire personnel are also attending to a second fire near Sheffield, which was reported on October 18. \"We appreciate the combined suppression response with our local, county, and state partners. Combined efforts from local volunteer fire departments and Forest fire resources from the Minister Creek fire were able to quickly contain this fire to three acres,\" he said. This fire is still under investigation. He added that while the ANF has received some precipitation, it is not enough to impact the fire danger.</p><p>The ANF is seeing a welcomed increase in recreational visitors but reminds users to observe fire safe practices and Leave No Trace Principles. According to Kostrzewski, most wildfires on the ANF are human caused. \"This past year, the leading causes of wildfire on the Forest were abandoned campfires and debris burning.\"</p><p>He stressed that Forest visitors should know before they go: check the fire danger for the area you plan to visit; verify if there are current restrictions in place; build fires within contained fire rings on top of mineral soil and not on leaf litter, duff or organic matter; never leave the fire unattended; drown, stir and feel your campfire coals to ensure that the fire is dead out and cold to the touch.

Last year saw the highest annual accumulated FFDI on record. Australia was the first country in the world to report the impact of climate change on bushfires through CSIRO's work to model the increase in high fire danger days.</p><p>During Senate Estimates last week, CSIRO was asked specifically about the Climate Change in Australia (2015) report and if it has undertaken any explicit studies to attribute the Australian increase in fire weather to climate change since that report. CSIRO confirmed it has not.</p><p>This should not have been interpreted as there being no link between bushfires and climate change</p><p>Research about the detection of climate change and attribution to an increase in conditions which influence (not cause) bushfires has been published since the 2015 report. CSIRO draws on this data and observations.</p><p>Specifically in 2018, the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program published \"Bushfires and climate change in Australia [pdf - 3.5mb] \" showed a clear trend towards more dangerous conditions during spring and summer in southern Australia, including increased frequency and magnitude of extremes, as well as indicating an earlier start to the fire season, with these changes attributable at least in part to anthropogenic climate change including in relation to increasing temperatures (Dowdy 2018). Additionally, a recent study examining an extreme fire event in Queensland during 2018 found that climate change made the conditions more dangerous (Lewis 2019).

While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event. <br/> The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. <br/> The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff. <br/> Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tomforstpete.com\">http://www.tomforstpete.com</url>/ <br/>However, Meade County could be a harbinger of things to come for the Upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. <br/> 'This coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,' he said. 'It will find you, and it's so infectious.' <br/> Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations. Some health officials noted people could have caught the virus elsewhere. <br/> A team from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention determined last year's rally looked like a 'superspreader event.'[3] The team said the event offered a lesson: Such large gatherings can result in 'widespread transmission' of infections and attendees should follow precautions like getting vaccinated, wearing masks and social distancing. <br/> The aftermath of this year's rally lookseerily similar to last year[4]\u2014 when the event heralded a wave that did not subside until the winter. <url normalizedValue=\"http://alentomczak.com\">http://alentomczak.com</url>/ <br/>But the pandemic fallout from the rally won't be seen for weeks and an exact case count will likely remain unknown, Osterholm said. <br/> Daniel Bucheli, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the virus spike is following 'a national trend being experienced in every state, not just South Dakota.' <br/> He also pointed out that Meade County's vaccination rate of 45% lags behind the statewide rate of 56% eligible people vaccinated. <br/> The city of Sturgis also downplayed the virus numbers, issuing a statement that blamed the increase in positivity rate on a 'significant increase in testing performed to proactively reduce the spread of COVID-19' and accusing 'individuals in the national media' of mischaracterizing the event. <br/> Despite the more contagious delta variant, this year's motorcycle rally waseven bigger than last year.[5]More than 500,000 people showed up during the 10-day rally. <br/> The streets of Sturgis filled with rallygoers drawn to the libertarian rules of South Dakota[6]\u2014 motorcycle helmets weren't required, minimal attire and bodypainting were welcome, and masks were often nowhere in sight.

While it is not clear how much rallygoers spread the virus through secondary infections, state health officials have so far reported 63 cases among South Dakota residents who attended the event.</p><p>The epicenter of the rally, Meade County, has become red-hot with new cases, reaching a per capita rate that is similar to the hardest-hit Southern states. The county reported the highest rate of cases in the state over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.</p><p>The Black Hills region's largest hospital system, Monument Health, warned Friday that it has seen hospitalizations from the virus rise from five to 78 this month. The hospital was bracing for more COVID-19 patients by converting rooms to intensive care units and reassigning staff.</p><p>Virus cases were already on the rise when the rally started, and it's difficult to measure just how much the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is to blame in a region where local fairs, youth sports leagues and other gatherings have resumed.</p><p>However, Meade County could be a harbinger of things to come for the Upper Midwest as infections ripple from those events, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.</p><p>\"This coronavirus forest fire will keep burning any human wood it can find,\" he said. \"It will find you, and it's so infectious.\"</p><p>Health officials in North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin all reported cases among people who attended the rally, with North Dakota also reporting two hospitalizations. Some health officials noted people could have caught the virus elsewhere.</p><p>A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined last year's rally looked like a \"superspreader event.\" The team said the event offered a lesson: Such large gatherings can result in \"widespread transmission\" of infections and attendees should follow precautions like getting vaccinated, wearing masks and social distancing.</p><p>The aftermath of this year's rally looks eerily similar to last year - when the event heralded a wave that did not subside until the winter.</p><p>But the pandemic fallout from the rally won't be seen for weeks and an exact case count will likely remain unknown, Osterholm said.</p><p>Daniel Bucheli, a spokesman for the state Department of Health, said the virus spike is following \"a national trend being experienced in every state, not just South Dakota.\"</p><p>He also pointed out that Meade County's vaccination rate of 45% lags behind the statewide rate of 56% eligible people vaccinated.</p><p>The city of Sturgis also downplayed the virus numbers, issuing a statement that blamed the increase in positivity rate on a \"significant increase in testing performed to proactively reduce the spread of COVID-19\" and accusing \"individuals in the national media\" of mischaracterizing the event.</p><p>Despite the more contagious delta variant, this year's motorcycle rally was even bigger than last year. More than 500,000 people showed up during the 10-day rally.</p><p>The streets of Sturgis filled with rallygoers drawn to the libertarian rules of South Dakota - motorcycle helmets weren't required, minimal attire and bodypainting were welcome, and masks were often nowhere in sight. Bikers bellied up to bars and packed into rock shows.</p><p>Two bands that performed at the rally have canceled shows after musicians came down with the virus. Corey Taylor, the lead singer of Slipknot who had embarked on a solo tour, told fans he was \"very, very sick\" from COVID-19, though he did not say where he contracted it.</p><p>\"This is the worst I've ever been sick in my life,\" Taylor said in a Facebook video this week. \"Had I not been vaccinated, I shudder to think how bad it would have been.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Fans attend a performance by Saul on Aug. 14 at the Iron Horse Saloon during the 80th annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, in Sturgis, S.D.

A climate change-fueled megadrought also is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists say.</p><p>The National Weather Service said, however, that the heat wave appeared to have peaked in many areas, and excessive-heat warnings were largely expected to expire by Monday night or Tuesday.</p><p>The two largest fires were burning forests in northeastern California and southern Oregon, sending smoke across other states.</p><p>The Beckwourth Complex, two lightning-ignited blazes, covered about 140 square miles (362 square kilometers) on Northern California\u2019s border with Nevada. Plumas National Forest officials said firefighters successfully contained almost a quarter of the blaze but still expected some extreme fire activity.</p><p>Evacuation orders were in effect for more than 3,000 residents of remote areas of California\u2019s Lassen and Plumas counties and Nevada\u2019s Washoe County. Some structures were destroyed over the weekend in Doyle, California, a town of about 600 residents.</p><p>\u201cA damage assessment team has arrived to validate and assess reports of structures damaged or destroyed,\u201d a forest statement said.</p><p>In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire covered 240 square miles (621 square kilometers) in the Fremont-Winema National Forest, near the Klamath County town of Sprague River.</p><p>After doubling in size at least twice over the weekend, it grew only incrementally Sunday, a sign of some progress, said Rich Saalsaa, spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s allowed firefighters to build more lines and go on the offensive,\u201d Saalsaa said.</p><p>Seven homes and 43 outbuildings have been destroyed in an area on the south end of the blaze, Saalsaa said.</p><p>\u201cMost of these places are not within a community per se. Maybe they\u2019re the same postal zone. But it\u2019s kind of scattered out there, very remote,\u201d Saalsaa said.</p><p>Some 1,926 homes were within the current evacuation zone, he said, but he didn\u2019t know how many people that includes.</p><p>Firefighters were contending with erratic winds, but temperatures were slightly lower.</p><p>In central Oregon, a wildfire that started Sunday near the resort town of Sisters doubled in size to 6.2 square miles (16 square kilometers).</p><p>The Bootleg Fire disrupted service on three transmission lines providing up to 5,500 megawatts of electricity to California, where the state\u2019s grid operator asked for voluntary power conservation from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. to ease the strain. The timing coincides with decreasing generation from solar facilities as night falls.</p><p>Elsewhere, a forest fire started during lightning storms in southeast Washington grew to 86 square miles (223 square kilometers). It was 20% contained Monday.</p><p>Another fire west of Winthrop closed the scenic North Cascades Highway, the most northern route through the Cascade Range. The road provides access to North Cascades National Park and the Ross Lake National Recreation Area.</p><p>In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little mobilized the National Guard to help fight twin lightning-sparked fires that have together charred nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) of dry timber in the remote, drought-stricken region.</p><p>A new fire broke out Sunday afternoon in the Sierra Nevada south of Yosemite National Park and by evening had exploded over more than 6 square miles (15.5 square kilometers), triggering evacuations in areas of two counties.

A climate change-fueled megadrought also is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists say.</p><p>The National Weather Service said, however, that the heat wave appeared to have peaked in many areas, and excessive-heat warnings were largely expected to expire by Monday night or Tuesday.</p><p>The two largest fires were burning forests in northeastern California and southern Oregon, sending smoke across other states.</p><p>The Beckwourth Complex, two lightning-ignited blazes, covered about 140 square miles (362 square kilometers) on Northern California\u2019s border with Nevada. Plumas National Forest officials said firefighters successfully contained almost a quarter of the blaze but still expected some extreme fire activity.</p><p>Evacuation orders were in effect for more than 3,000 residents of remote areas of California\u2019s Lassen and Plumas counties and Nevada\u2019s Washoe County.

But think about Canada. This is a nation with an entire identity based on being cold, not burning in huge fires. What will it do? [1] </p><p><br/><br/>Two weeks ago, the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices released a report on the public health impacts of climate change[2] and the need for action to adapt to a new reality of extreme threats. <br/>'Climate change,' Ian Culbert, executive director of the Canadian Public Health Association, wrote in the report's introduction,'is an escalating public health emergency, and we need to start treating it that way.' <br/>The historic and deadly heat wave in British Columbia made those words frighteningly real \u2014even before it triggereda forest fire that destroyed most of the village of Lytton, British Columbia[3]. <br/>'We are now committed to a certain degree of warming in the world because of the emissions of the past,' Ryan Ness, the adaptation research director for the institute and co-author of the report, said in an interview on Friday. <br/>'So while, in the longer term, it's absolutely critical to reduce greenhouse gases as much as possible, as fast as possible, to keep things from getting even worse, there is a certain amount of climate change that we can no longer avoid. And the only way to really deal with that is to prepare, to adapt and to become more resilient to this change in climate.' <br/>That meanscountering the increased risk of floods and forest fires. It also meansaccounting for how climate change will threaten Canadians' health. <br/><br/>And more people will die: the report estimates that,by mid-century, heat will account for an additional 200 to 425 deaths in Canadaper year. <br/>The Institute did find that two measures to retrofit buildings would reduce the death toll. 'If shading technologies were installed on 25 per cent of homes in Canada by the 2050s, there would be an average of 21 fewer deaths per year,' the report says. 'If 50 per cent of all residential, commercial, and institutional buildings had green roofs installed by the 2050s, an average of 46 deaths would be avoided annually.' <br/>But while green roofs and shading might reduce the impact of generally higher temperatures, such things won't necessarily be enough to protect people from extreme events. <br/>'When it comes to these extreme heat emergencies, the response systems really need to be in place to be able to identify the people who are going to be most affected by this and to get them the care that they need, whether it's cooling centres, whether it's medical attention, whether it's a place to get off the streets,' Ness said. <br/>'And in the longer term, it's going to be important to address the underlying root causes of what makes some people more vulnerable than others. Because it's not really the average person who's likely to die from a heat wave event. It's somebody who is living on the street, somebody who has pre-existing health conditions because they aren't able to access the health care that they need, or seniors who don't have the supports they need to to help them out in these situations.' <br/><br/>I'd say it's likely to cause a heck of a lot more than 425 deaths per year. But either way, another part of Canada's identity is as a kinder, gentler place than the U.S., taking care of its people (First Nations need not apply of course). Will that continue? How will the need to revolutionary change the way we live co-exist with Canadian values? It will be something to watch in any case. I have little to no belief that the U.S. will ever lead the way on this.

Bushtook issue with Donald Trump's reckless pandemic conduct, calling out the president for his plans to hold a series of potential super-spreader campaign rallies in swing states where coronavirus rates are rising again. </p><p>Speaking with CNN'sErin Burnetton Tuesday night, Dr. Jonathan Reinercriticized Trump for setting a shockingly irresponsible example that has led to thousands of his rallygoers refusing to wear masks \u2014 for various, medically dubious reasons[1]. 'We just pointed out [Trump is] going to be going to Pennsylvania a lot. He's going to do everything he can to get as many images like what we just saw on people's screens,' Burnett said, as footage aired of Trump's mostly maskless, lack of socially distanced rally in Johnstown. 'So they are going to see those numbers. He's trying to use that to energize his base. So what do you say to that, given the resurgence in cases across this country?' 'I say that the president is doing a lot of the virus' work. He's like the caddie for the virus,' Reiner snarked. 'If you look at the battleground states \u2014 Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina \u2014 the virus is surging in all of those states.' According to theNew York Times' Covid tracker[2], 26 of the 50 states \u2014 among them many high-profile swing states \u2014 are currently seeing sharply spiking rates, and 18 more are experiencing rising coronavirus cases from a lower baseline. 'If you think about unmasked people in mass gatherings, it's like dry brush in a forest fire. When the fire encounters that dry brush, it ignites and intensifies the fire,' Reiner explained. 'That's what happens in a pandemic when you put together unmasked people. The president is making it easier for the virus to spread in those states. It's \u2014 you know, maybe this helps him electorally. I don't understand the politics here. But it's very damaging to the public health.' Watch the video above, via CNN. Have a tip we should know?

Please go ahead, sir.</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO, CFO, EMPRESAS COPEC S.A.: Thank you very much. Thank you, and welcome, all of you, and thanks for joining this call where we will be taking a look at the results of Empresas Copec for the first quarter 2023. We are joined today as we usually are by people from our Investor Relations department, led by Mr. Cristian Palacios; and also people from Arauco, led by Mr. Gianfranco Truffello, and they will be helping us out in any questions you might have that we will address at the end of the presentation.</p><p>Having said that, let me now switch to Page 4, where we will be taking a look at some of the most important highlights that we have seen during the quarter. This is -- this is a quarter where we reported a result and EBITDA that was -- the EBITDA was pretty much in line with the previous quarter. It was lower, though than last year's comparable quarter. The higher results Q-on-Q have to do essentially with some nonoperational factors that affected the performance of the company during the last quarter of 2022.</p><p>And the lower results year-on-year have to do with diminished performance in the case of Arauco and Copec, the details of which we will see along the presentation. In the case of Forestry, we had -- Q-on-Q, we had higher other income, basically because we had recorded negative revaluation of Forestry assets during the last Q 2022. And that had to do with -- essentially with the effect of increased interest rates on the valuation of our Forestry assets.</p><p>We also had in terms of -- in operational terms, we had volumes and prices decreasing Q-on-Q. Year-on-year, we definitely have an operational decrease that has to do with the drop in volumes and also to lower prices in the wood segments, as we will see going forward. Together with that, in the Forestry division, we had increased other expenses that had to do with forest fires that affected the company during the first 2 months this year and also with temporary stoppages of different mills.</p><p>In the Energy division, the same pattern, we had higher Q-on-Q results and lower year-on-year. In the case of Q-on-Q, they had to do basically with lower administration distribution costs. These costs in the Energy division are usually have some seasonality and tend to increase towards the end of the year. So this first quarter, we saw a lower level of SG&amp;A in general. Together with that, we saw volumes increasing, essentially in Chile. In terms of year-on-year, we had lower results in Copec, Mapco and Terpel. And an essential part of that was the fact that during the first quarter of last year, we recorded a nonrecurrent effect because of the sale of some gas stations at Mapco during the first quarter 2022. In terms of the projects that we are carrying forward and other developments, we had -- in April, we had our ordinary shareholders' meeting. where, among other things, we presented the final figure for our CapEx plan this year will -- of which we will be also presenting in this session.</p><p>Together with that, we had Arauco publishing an update on the effects of the forest fires that hurt the company during the first few months. And Copec made an announcement in regard to the Mapco subsidiary, the subsidiary operates in the U.S.Copec has written an agreement for the sale of that subsidiary. And we will be taking a look at the details of that as well.</p><p>In terms of ESG, we continue to make progress in ESG matters. We published for the first time our integrated report. There's a lot of information there. It's definitely worth a look. Arauco issued sustainable bonds in the local market. And Copec continues to make progress in electromobility and also in some initiatives related to complementing its current business model.</p><p>Let me go into the numbers. We recorded an EBITDA of $662 million, which is pretty much in line with the previous quarter, where we had $ 679 million. but it's definitely lower than the $959 million that we recorded in the first quarter last year when we had exceptional conditions in the market. Net income is $155 million, which compares well with the slight loss that we recorded last quarter, but of course, is, at the same time, much lower than the $619 million that we recorded in the first quarter 2022.</p><p>The EBITDA is down on a year-on-year basis from $959 million to $662 million. The bulk of that decrease has to do with the Forestry sector, where we saw essentially a drop in volumes in pulp and also a drop in volumes as well as prices in the case of wood products. In the case of the Energy sector, we saw also some decrease in EBITDA, which is linked basically to an increase in administration and distribution costs.</p><p>To the right-hand side of this graph, you can see that, as usually happens, our EBITDA is explained to a great extent by AraucoCopec and Abastible, which make up more than 90% of our total EBITDA. In the case of net income, we recorded $155 million, which means a 75% decrease on the figure related to the first quarter of 2022. In this particular case, we see a drop in Arauco, which has to do with operational and nonoperational factors. Among the latter, we see the temporary shutdowns of mills plus the forest fires. And also a decrease at Copec, where the essential explanation there is the sale of some gas stations of Mapco that took place during the first quarter 2022.</p><p>Together with those 2 factors, we also had a slight decrease in Alxar Internacional, which is the parent company of Mina Justa. And that has to do basically with a lower operational performance, although it was still very good. So we are comparing ourselves with an exceptional quarter in the first quarter of 2022. We still have very good results at Mina Justa, although a bit lower than last year.</p><p>Let's go into some more detail for the income statement. As we saw before, we have a net income of $155 million, an operating income of $339 million, which is down $329 million with respect to last year, and that has to do basically with Arauco, which presents lower volumes in the wood segment and in the pulp segment and also lower prices in the wood segment. Together with that, we have higher costs at Arauco, which essentially have to do with the ramping up of MAPA and with stoppages of mills.</p><p>In Copec, we saw higher administration and distribution costs, which explained the drop in EBITDA. However, gross margins were very stable in spite of a negative effect in inventories. We were able to keep stable gross margins on account of growing volumes and also good performance of industrial margins and commercial margins.</p><p>In the case of nonoperating income, you can see, as we already mentioned, some increased expenses for -- related to planned stoppages for $140 million at the Arauco level and also the net effect of the forest fires, which is $43 million. Together with that, lower other income due to the sale of some assets in Mapco -- at the Mapco level during the first quarter of 2022. Together with that, we also have $50 million of increased net financial expenses at the consolidated level, and this has to do with debt increasing somewhat, but also with debt that is linked to inflation and some interest expenses that have ceased to be capitalized and are going into the income statement.</p><p>In terms of our balance sheet and financial ratios, we continue to show good operating returns. 11.5% of return on capital employed, which is a bit less than last year, but still very good. Leverage has gone up from the low levels of 1.9x and 2x that we were seeing a couple of quarters ago. That has to do with debt increasing to a certain extent. EBITDA, of course, going down, 12-month EBITDA going down. But at the same time, we have some capital -- some working capital effects especially at the Copec level, many of which should be transitory. So -- but still very, very controlled levels of that.</p><p>You can see that we have a well-balanced debt schedule for the coming years. So that is distributed among many, many years. However, we have some massive maturities during this year, many of which we have been tackling already with some refinancing operations. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned before, Arauco already issued a local bond in the -- local bond in the local financial market for $250 million.</p><p>Then going to the different divisions. Let me start with Forestry. Arauco's EBITDA has gone down to $328 million compared with $595 million in the first quarter 2022. This figure is slightly different from that posted by the subsidiary Arauco because of the definition of EBITDA that we use. In our particular case, we are not including the plant stoppages. The reason for the drop in EBITDA is a drop in pulp, panels and some timber volumes, together with prices in the wood division, a generalized drop in prices, which is all partly offset by higher prices in pulp.</p><p>Together with that, we saw increased unit costs for all segments. And as we said before, we have the nonoperational factors that affect results during the first part of the year, which had to do with temporary stoppages at many different plants in Arauco. Neuva Aldea, Constituci\u00c3\u00b3n, Arauco and Esperanza, all of those mills showed stoppages during the first part of the year with a total cost of $140 million and also the net effect of the forest fires amounting to $43 million. As we saw before, financial expenses have gradually trended to rise. In the case of Arauco, this has to do essentially with some interest expenses in MAPA that had been capitalized. And given that construction is already terminated, they are not capitalized anymore, rather they are going to the income statement.</p><p>In the case of the pulp division, and now we're showing the Arauco's pulp EBITDA for pulp figure. It is $78 million comparing very negatively with the $325 million that took place in the first quarter last year. And that has to do as we said before, with lower volumes basically offset to some extent by higher prices. And together with that, increased unit selling costs having to do essentially with plant stoppages and ramping up of MAPA.</p><p>In the case of Q-on-Q, we also saw EBITDA coming down. You can see there that production was widely affected by these stoppages of mills. It hasn't been a good quarter in terms of production. And of course, that also has impacted our sales volumes as well have been harder to materialize because of the pulp markets weakening, as you all know, during the first part of the year. As a matter of fact, we have some discussion on the behavior of pulp prices and markets during the first part of the year in this slide that you are seeing now. We have seen a sharp decrease in pulp prices, an increase in inventories, which are up to 52 days in the case of hardwood and 47 days in the case of softwood, which are -- both figures that are above historical levels. The arbitrage among different markets has increased. So we have ceased to see the decoupling of the different markets that had happened during some time because of logistical issues.</p><p>So now we have seen higher hardwood production in Europe, for example, that has been placed in Asia. Together with that in China, we have seen paper markets that are weaker than expected. We have seen some increased supply coming from Russia. And of course, all of that has put some downward pleasure on prices. In Europe, we also have seen some decreased demand. However, demand in the tissue market has remained stable. But anyhow, we are also seeing a drop in prices in Europe. Probably the only market that has remained healthy and stable during the first quarter is dissolving pulp, where we have seen stability and prices actually increasing a bit during February and March.</p><p>Operation rate is also very healthy with a 70% to 80% for the whole industry. As we said before, production in the case of Arauco has been hurt by several stoppages of different mills, and therefore, we have decreased production. We have started operations in the MAPA project, which is Arauco's Line 3. However, in the first quarter, we have a very low production and no sales at all during the first quarter, coming from MAPA.</p><p>You can also see that total demand -- global demand for the year as of March has decreased a bit, in spite of a very sharp increase in China, but that has been more than offset by decreases in Europe, North America and other Asian countries. Going forward, we have seen some signals of increase in paper demand, but probably not enough to offset the lower export of papers. We are seeing buyers still, especially paper makers, still refraining from buying and waiting for improved conditions. They know that more capacity is coming on stream. So many of them are holding on to their inventories and looking for -- coming back to the markets and replenishing them further on during the year.</p><p>In Europe, we have seen paper demand gradually increasing. And most paper producers, however, taking downtimes in order to keep their margins stable and avoid dropping prices. And with all that, we continue to see some challenging months ahead. But however, we believe that pulp prices are very close to the bottom since there are many producers that at these price levels are already selling below their costs. So we should gradually begin to see a rebound in the next few months. We can see in the graph in the bottom left corner that the net prices in China have decreased quite significantly. We are now selling at $475 hardwood and $680 softwood. So sharp declines from the levels not many months ago when we were selling at more than close to $900 per ton for hardwood and above $1,000 per ton for softwood. As we commented before, dissolving pulp has been much more stable and it's still at levels of around $900 per ton.</p><p>A brief discussion on wood products. You can see here that EBITDA is $136 million for the quarter, which is pretty much in line, I would say, with the previous quarter, but of course, much lower than the exceptionally good first quarter 2022 that we had. What has been happening here is that EBITDA has been trending gradually towards historical levels. This used to be a division that generated between $400 million and $500 million per year. During the years following -- immediately following the pandemic, we saw that figure going up to more than $1 billion per year.</p><p>But now we're going down again to the historical level. So $135 million for the quarter. That has to do with the drop in both prices and volumes for the different products. And you can see that basically across the board in the case of panels and in the case of solid wood, we have seen a drop in prices and also in volumes. Some elements for our different markets. In the case of North America, which is by far, our most important market for this division, representing 57% of revenues as of the state. We can see that MDF demand has been declining, which, of course, is linked to an extent with a decreased real estate activity, which in turn relates to the economic situation and the interest rate going up in part.</p><p>Together with that, we are seeing higher supply, especially from Brazil, so that is putting additional pressure on the market. In the case of particle boards, we are seeing demand that is going down slightly as well. But in this case, we do not have the effect of additional production from other countries coming in. So it's slightly better than MDF.</p><p>In the case of remanufactured, the outlook seems to be better, definitely. We have seen inventories normalizing gradually, and we see that the market could stabilize in the coming months. Same thing in the same -- in the case of plywood, we have seen a stable market with balanced supply and demand. And therefore, we could see the market continuing to strengthen during the coming months. In the case of Latin America, Brazil continues to be a market where we see some causes for concern. Demand has been picking up gradually. We see some signals of demand rebounding, but we are seeing some additional supply of MDF coming on stream at the same time and because of this import, we see more exports materializing. So production within Brazil that is sold to other markets around the world. In the case of Chile, we have seen prices in general continuing to decline for remanufactured products especially and panels as well. And this has to do to a great extent with a decreased activity in the construction sector.</p><p>Argentina, surprisingly, has continued to be stable in terms of volumes and prices, in spite of the stability in the country. And then we have other markets, which are less significant for our wood products. Asia and Oceania represent 10% of our total sales and basically the same pattern we are seeing demand slightly going down and some increased supply as well from other countries that are beginning to export their production.</p><p>Moving on to the Energy sector. We had -- it's actually quite a strong performance at the Copec level. This is the EBITDA measured in local currency, CLP 217 billion compared to CLP 252 billion in the first quarter 2022. This is a good performance according to historical levels, although it is lower than the first quarter 2022, which was also an exceptional quarter.</p><p>We had -- as we mentioned before, we had essentially higher administrative costs due to an increase in transportation costs and also a significant effect of labor costs, which is in turn linked to inflation in Chile, inflation in Colombia and in the countries where we operate. Together with that, we had an unfavorable effect of inventory revaluation in Chile and also in Colombia.</p><p>In spite of that, as I mentioned before, we were able to keep gross margins pretty stable. And that import has to do with volumes still growing. We have a 2.7% increase in Chile and 0.9% increase in Terpel as a whole, all of that offset by a drop of 11% in Mapco, which is explained to some extent by the sale of gas stations during the first part of the year 2022. The lubricant segment shows a healthy performance, I would say, especially in terms of margin, offset to some extent by a drop in volumes.</p><p>And as we mentioned before, we have nonoperational decrease explained by the sale of the Mapco gas stations during the first quarter 2022. Market share, as shown here, continues to be very stable and in the ranges at which we have been historically with a 58% as of December 2022, which is the latest figure published. The volumes continue to be above pre-pandemic levels, although the rates of growth of the different geographies are lower than that and those we saw immediately following the pandemic.</p><p>Together with that, we are seeing real margins, commercial margins under pressure because of high inflation. We have seen this since last year, of course. We continue to be exposed, although this tends to be a business which -- with very stable markets. We continue to be exposed to some factors of volatility among them, the inventory effects and also some variations in the industrial channel.</p><p>However, we deem our gas station network and our brand to be in a very good commercial position and that gives us solid competitive advantage. In the case of the volumes, you can see the graph in the upper right-hand corner, it's a healthy level of volumes, which is up with respect to the immediately preceding quarter and also with respect to the first quarter 2022. So we are seeing the industrial channel, especially up by a significant percentage. And in the case of the gas stations we saw in this particular quarter, we saw a decrease.</p><p>Moving on to Terpel. It also was a good quarter in historical terms. You can see there the EBITDA is up to COP 333 billion compared to COP 362 billion. Once again, we had an exceptional performance in the first quarter of 2022, but in historical terms, this is a very healthy EBITDA generation.</p><p>The drop with respect to last year is explained in part with by inventory revaluation, which was negative this year. But also by an accounting change of criteria, some contributions that are made to franchisees, used to be recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over time, and therefore, that did not impact EBITDA. However, with this change of criteria, we are beginning to record those contributions as expenses, and therefore, they do affect EBITDA. And that accounts for more than COP 20 billion of the difference with respect to last year. So part of the difference -- a large part of the difference actually is explained by this change in accounting criteria.</p><p>Liquid fuels are quite healthy in many markets. In the case of Peru, we have grown significantly, having to do with industrial and also aviation volumes. In the case of Panama and Dominion Republic, we also saw some increases. All of that offset to some extent by slight drops in Colombia and Ecuador. Together with that, we saw a healthy performance of the lubricant segment.</p><p>In the case of Mapco, EBITDA is $13.2 million for the quarter, which is also quite good according to historical terms, but lower than last year, which was $15.6 million. The drop has to do to a large extent, of course, with the fact that we at the end of the first quarter in 2022, we closed and materialized the sale of this approximately 10% of the total number of gas stations of Mapco that we sold to a third party at the beginning of -- at the end of the first quarter last year.</p><p>So the drop in volumes and the drop of EBITDA has to do to a large extent with that sale. Margins continue to be very healthy in this market. Abastible, which is liquid gas, the performance in this quarter was quite healthy. We saw it in line with last quarter, but definitely much higher than the first quarter 2022. So $28 billion at the consolidated level at Abastible compared with $21 billion in the first quarter 2022. This stems basically from an operational performance, which was very good with increases across the board in all geographies, basically. We saw an interesting increase in volumes coming from Chile, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. So across all geographies, an interesting increase in volumes.</p><p>Some more details on the different countries in which we operate. In the case of Chile and Colombia, the behavior is quite similar, a very similar pattern. We've seen volumes in the bottled segment, which have decreased year-on-year. However, we have seen healthier margins. Margins have been hurt significantly previously by the rising propane prices, and now they have been gradually recovering to -- gradually trending to their historical levels, so more healthy margins in the bottled segments. And in both countries, Chile and Colombia, a very good performance of the bulk segment, and this has to do with an increased base of clients both Abastible in Chile and Norgas in Colombia have done very well in terms of expanding their client base in their respective geographies. And therefore, we have seen volumes increase significantly. This is partially offset by a decrease in margins, which has to do essentially with a mix effect. So we have seen more high volume and low-margin clients coming into the client base. So very similar behavior for both Chile and Colombia.</p><p>In the case of Peru, the performance here has been quite extraordinary, I would say, with a drop -- with an increase in volumes of close to 20%. In spite of the political situation that hurt the country during the first 2 months this year, where we had a lot of instability with some supply disruptions and some blockades in the different routes around the country. In spite of that, we were able to increase our volumes by 19%. This has to do with a very good performance essentially in the bottled segment having to do in turn with a very successful marketing and commercial strategy. Together with that, we have seen increased margins in both segments. And finally, in Ecuador, volumes continue to increase at the, I would say, very normal rates of 2.8% in this case, very close to historical levels. And in both segments, we have seen this healthy increase.</p><p>Moving on to our other investments. The most important investment that we have here is Cumbres Andinas, which is the parent company for Mina Justa, where we saw a decreased EBITDA and decreased net income when comparing it to the first quarter of 2022. Once again, it is a very good performance for the quarter. However, we are comparing it to an exceptional base. So the base of comparison is very, very high. We had exceptional performance in the first quarter 2022, but performance continues to be quite good with an EBITDA generation of $222 million.</p><p>We have seen production at a very stable level with -- however, the mix of production between cathodes and concentrates changing a bit. We have seen cash cost going up to some extent with respect to the first quarter 2022. But going down from the levels that we saw at some point during 2022, which reached up to $1.6 million. We are now back to $1.3 million and we expect them to remain at levels somewhere around $1.3 million to $1.4 million for the rest of the year. This operation is doing quite well, and we expect to get to 150,000 tons sold during the year, produced at least and eventually sold during the year. And therefore, we would be reaching our total capacity for the first time during this year. In the case of our other subsidiaries, very stable situation and not a lot to comment for the other subsidiaries.</p><p>Moving on to the highlights of the quarter. Let me begin here by addressing the CapEx figure that we published. We had anticipated this in our last conference call, and there are not a lot of news regarding the information that we gave you in that last conference call. So total CapEx for the year is expected to be around $1.8 billion. This represents, of course, a decrease from the very high figure that we had -- $2.3 billion that we had during 2022, which involved, of course, the acquisition of Blue Express and the end of the construction of MAPA, among other exceptional sources of CapEx.</p><p>In this case, during the year, the $1.8 billion is explained to some extent with -- by maintenance CapEx, which should amount to approximately $900 million. Together with that, we have some growth CapEx at both the Forestry division and the Fuel division. In the case of Forestry, some of that will be devoted to lands and plantations. A portion of that in Brazil and in relation to our Sucuri\u00c3\u00ba project. Together with that, we are building our Zit\u00c3\u00a1cuaro mill, our panel mill in Mexico, and we are acquiring some remnants of equipment for MAPA.</p><p>In the Energy division, we are doing some network optimization, building up some new gas station points as we always do, and also contemplating some expenses and CapEx, which is going to be focused in the energy transition and a business model optimization and transformation for Copec for facing the electromobility scenario.</p><p>Finally, we have, let's say, $200 million to $300 million of CapEx that will be devoted to a lot of initiatives having to do with efficiencies. Efficiencies at our mills, our logistics. Many of those have been postponed during the pandemic when we had more -- a tighter credit situation. But at this point in time, we should be able to address those projects as well, which are also very promising in terms of lowering costs and increasing efficiency. The bulk of the CapEx goes to -- as expected, goes to the Forestry sector, approximately 70% goes to the Forestry sector and 25% to the Energy sector, pretty much in line with the base of assets that we have in those 2 divisions.</p><p>We announced the sale of Mapco, and this has to do with the strategy that we envisaged at some point in time and that we have mentioned many times, actually. Basically, what we -- that we have seen here when we first decided to enter Mapco back in 5 or 6 years ago, we declared that one of the sources of that is that we saw was the fact that it ranked poorly according to many operational measures, which were far below the industry average in the U.S. We had achieved the objective of bringing up to date the operational performance of Mapco to a great extent. And actually, as a matter of fact, we have basically doubled EBITDA since we took control 5 or 6 years ago. Together with that, we also mentioned at that point that we saw opportunities for consolidation in the market. This market is very disaggregated. And we saw some opportunities for consolidating and therefore, leveraging and giving way to synergies among different players.</p><p>We still see that but we also see that the scale required for being an efficient player is much larger than the one we have. And therefore, as a matter of fact, we have sold our assets. One of the buyers is a network -- is a company that operates a network in the U.S. that is 20x the network that we operate. So clearly, this is a business in the U.S. that requires a lot of scale that has to do with rising costs, has to do with energy transition. And therefore, clearly, it is an asset that is worth more in the hands of third parties.</p><p>With all that in mind, we have announced this agreement to sell the Mapco company to 2 buyers. One of them is Circle K Stores and the other one is Majors Management. As you well know, Mapco is a company that operates gas stations in several states around the U.S., The most important one of them being Tennessee. The transaction price, the EV that was agreed for this transaction, the enterprise value was $725 million and of course, this is subject to customary adjustments for these type of transactions.</p><p>Cash held by the company at this point in time is around $40 million -- $40 million to $50 million. So that should be one of the adjustments that should take place. We estimate that the net income before taxes that will be generated by this operation is around $100 million income before taxes. And we expect to close the transaction during the last quarter of this year. It is subject -- still subject to the approval of different authorities, and therefore, we have to wait for that.</p><p>In relation to forest fires, Arauco issued an update on the forest fires. This was an intense season during this year, although there was a smaller number of incidents, the number of hectares that was affected -- that were affected by the forest fires is much higher than last year. This was basically a consequence of irresponsible or even intentional actions by third parties, together with certain weather conditions and wind conditions that favor the expansions of fires.</p><p>In spite of all the efforts carried out by Arauco, which were very abundant, the damage to the company and to the country was quite significant during the forest fire season. 35% of fires was took place in the -- in third-party properties. As we mentioned before, the net effect of the fires, this is made up of the damage to our biological assets and lands, net of the recovery that we have estimated of wood that could be recovered from those plantations plus the recovery that we should get from the insurance company. All of that, the net effect should be 49 -- the one that we have recorded already is $42.9 million. That is being recorded as of March 2023.</p><p>In terms of ESG, we continue to make a lot of progress. This is a mention of the business that has become more and more relevant and which now ranks at the highest strategic level, and we have different highlights to mention here. One of them being the fact that we reported or published our first integrated report for the year 2022. This is a report that follows the standards of the Chilean Financial Authority, together with SASB and TCFD.</p><p>We have basically grouped our initiatives and our attainments and milestones along 4 pillars, which are listed there: governance and integrity, climate action and management of natural resources; sustainability and innovation; and social and economic value creation. You can see this report on our website, and it has lots of details, a lot of information on development -- developments, milestones, goals, metrics and so on and so forth for the -- for our different divisions. So you're welcome to have a look at this report.</p><p>As we mentioned before the Arauco went ahead with an issuance in the local bond market for a total of approximately $250 million in local currency linked to inflation. So UF is the currency of these bonds. The rates are shown there, 3.3% and 3.2% approximately for the 2 tenures that were issued, which are 9 and 21 years. These bonds have been rated as sustainable, which has to do with the fact that Arauco commits to allocating an amount similar to that raised in the issuance for initiatives related to green and social projects. And this can be done either during the 3 years preceding the issuance or during the lifetime of the bonds. So a good bond placement there by Arauco.</p><p>Copec continues to make progress with electromobility and energy transition. We had announced during the last few conference calls that we have progressively been awarded different terminals for charging buses -- city buses. We have actually started operations at 8 of the 10 terminals that we have been awarded, and we expect to have them all up and running by May this year.</p><p>In addition to that, we were also awarded the first terminal in Chile for interprovincial buses. So these are buses going from one city to another rather than within the same city. So this was also awarded to Copec. And then on another front, having to do with business model transformation and initiatives that complement our business model, we launched the application for electronic payments. And the rationale for that is basically the fact that we have a very interesting base of clients, 1 million clients visiting our gas station network on a daily basis.</p><p>We already had an application for paying at the pump at Copec, and it made a lot of sense to expand that application to offer additional services to those clients. So the first service that we are offering is this prepayment service. That is already loaded into this new app that we have launched. This is all part of the strategy of exploring and developing businesses that allow to add value for our existing assets and complement our business model.</p><p>So having said all that, I would welcome you to pose your questions. And we will have Cristian and Gianfranco joining us in this conversation to tackle whatever questions you might have.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your microphone is open.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE &amp; IR, EMPRESAS COPEC S.A.: Thank you all for joining. I'm going to start with a question from Jens Spiess at Morgan Stanley. This is in Forestry. So Gianfranco, if you can address it. Excluding the MAPA's ramp-up and maintenance shutdowns, have you seen an improvement in costs related to lower raw material prices and lower inflationary pressures?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO, CFO, ARAUCO FOREST BRASIL S.A.: Okay. Not really. I mean we have seen only in energy and fuels and of course, in freight -- in ocean freight, but not in, of course, in wood and chemicals yet. So our unitary prices and the variable cost in that portion continued to be more or less the same levels as 1 year ago. Of course, inflation is pushing salaries in the countries where we operate and inflation is still high in Chile around 10%. So that is pushing a little bit at the fixed cost. But in terms of variable costs, only in fuel and energy and freight, but we expect at some point that also chemicals will start to go down. Wood we don't see yet some diminishing in the cost of wood because it's a trend that is everywhere in the world that wood is more expensive.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Thank you, Gianfranco. I have another one. Alfonso Salazar at Scotiabank. He has a follow-on question. What in your view should support a pulp price recovery, given the demand is weak and the market expects supply to increase? And based on the past experience for how long do you think the price can stay close to the bottom?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: Well, every cycle is different, and it's very difficult to try to forecast the increase in prices. The last cycle we had a sharp increase in price after we reached the bottom, but that the situation was different. We were in the pandemic and not really a lot of supply coming into the market. This time it's different because we have 2 projects ramping up, our MAPA project and the UPM project in Uruguay. So we have 2 mills, adding volume. And the only thing that could change the level between demand and supply is an upturn in demand in China, something moving more the economy there, the demand for paper and some -- that pushing some restocking in the customers so they're willing to increase their stock and that could push prices up. But I think that we don't see big increases in the coming month. I think it will be a slow increase, if any, because of the additional supply that's coming to the market.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Thank you, Gianfranco. I have two questions also from Jens Spiess at Morgan Stanley. Rodrigo, regarding the Mapco sale, if you're contemplating a special dividend or paying down debt?</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Yes, we will be, as I mentioned in the presentation, the total profits coming from the Mapco sales should be up to $725 million approximately which is the enterprise value plus the adjustments that should be made towards the date at which we closed the transaction. Of course, part of that will go to pay down debt. Actually, there is a debt that is strictly associated to the Mapco acquisition, which amounts to $150 million to $200 million. And then regarding the other uses of the proceeds, of course, there will be some tax involved but also regarding the other users, still to see. I would say it's still to see and study. In terms of dividends, we have -- we are following our traditional long-term policy of 40% of net income. We have, in the past, paid out extraordinary dividends resulting from the sale of assets as we did when we sold Gasmar and the Forestry assets. But going forward, we should always aim to comply with our financial policy, which basically sets a range for net debt to EBITDA.</p><p>And at the same time, we should be able to finance profitable, sustainable growth and face refinancing needs under uncertainty. In this particular year, we're facing a lot of refinancing needs. So all of these factors should be taken into account when decided whether to pay an extraordinary dividend or not.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: And also, how much was the FIFO effect in the Fuels division during the first quarter and else equal, what are your expectations for second quarter?</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: We had a negative effect of FIFO, Colombia and Chile added of around approximately $10 million to $15 million, which compares with a positive effect last year. Last year, we had around $30 million to $35 million of positive effect. So a large part of the -- there was a significant negative effect coming from that source. It is very hard to project this effect. We usually work with FIFO at 0 level because it's very hard to project, and it has to do with the variations of oil prices and the moments at which we buy oil during the year. So we do not basically project negative or positive effects during the year. But so far this year, we do have a negative effect. As I told you, around $10 million of total negative effects, Chile plus Colombia consolidated.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Thank you, Rodrigo. I have Isabella Vasconcelos of Bradesco. If you can comment on examples of potential opportunities in new energy that you would be interested in?</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Yes. Well, as we have mentioned before in other conference calls, we acknowledge that we have a long-term threat coming from electromobility and from energy transition. Although it's very long term, we expect markets to continue growing in LatAm at least for several years, but we have decided to prepare ourselves for that scenario as soon as possible.</p><p>We are working along different lines. One of them is to be a leader in electromobility in the markets in which we operate. As a matter of fact, and as we have mentioned several times, we believe we are one of the leading players in Lat Am in this front. We are one of the players with the most number of gas stations and electrical charging points, both within and outside our gas station network. We are the most important provider of electricity for buses in Chile. The most important provider of electricity for mining fleets also in the countries where we operate in Chile particularly.</p><p>So one objective is to lead electromobility. Another objective is to explore different sources of energies and renewable energies and energies that -- in which our position and our existing assets may give way to a competitive advantage. One of the things we are doing, we have launched a project of distributed generation that we are going ahead with. It's a 150 mega solar panel-based generation model that we are going to be building during this year.</p><p>Small distributed projects, more than 20 different projects that add up to 150 megs. And together with that, we are exploring different opportunities related to energy, mobility and convenience basically. And as we have set up a special division basically and a venture capital like structure for tackling all this. So far, we have invested in solar panels, as I said, distributed generation, artificial intelligence-based system for managing and storing energy, new forms of convenience and so on and so forth.</p><p>These are all very small investments, which are basically the objective is to open up options for complementing our existing business model. Together with that, as we also mentioned during the presentation, we are complementing all this with other options that may complement our existing assets. The Blue Express acquisition fits in this kind of investments. They are -- in this case, it's a last-mile logistics company, which is expected to have a lot of synergies with our existing gas station network and also the payments application that we have already launched. That kind of initiatives also aims to add value to our existing assets and open up options for transforming our business model. So that's our line of growth going forward, not only in terms of energy, but also in terms of other initiatives that may be complementary to what we already have.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Thank you, Rodrigo. Another one in Forestry. Rafael Barcellos at Santander, asking if Gianfranco can provide a little bit more color on demand in wood panels business and give more color on each region, which one performing better or which one concerns you the most?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: Well, in panels, the region that is performing better for different reason is Argentina, but I mean it's completely isolated from what's happening in the rest of the world. But in terms of our biggest market, I would guess that, Mexico is doing very well. United States is doing quite well. I mean, it has decreased, of course, from the record demand that we had in the past, but it's behaving quite well.</p><p>And I will say that Brazil is more difficult, historically has been more difficult because of more supply. And Chile, it's a quite small market, more or less dedicated to export. So I would say that North America is doing okay. Argentina for macroeconomic reasons rather than real demand and Brazil has been more challenging. That's why I say as a -- but as a big summary, the panel demand -- the panel market is going back to where it was before these 2 years of craziness demand in -- during the pandemic. So we are back to normal levels. And we know how to behave in that market, how to manage capacity to equalize demand and we know how to behave in this environment.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: And a follow-up in pulp, if you can talk more about what are you seeing in terms of pulp buyers' sentiment?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: Well, as I mentioned, China is the main market for our pulp. And in that case, the economy is not consuming a lot of paper, basically because the export markets for Chinese products are a little bit depressed. And they use a lot of paper in the export market of the product and also exporting paper. The local demand for paper, it's quite normal. But it cannot compensate the diminishing in demand for exports.</p><p>So that is pushing paper production in China, at the same time, pushing down the demand for pulp. So that's a scenario we have right now. The inventories are low, but they're seeing high inventory in the ports or in the hands of producers. So they feel quite comfortable with having low stocks because they know that they can replenish those stocks very, very easy.</p><p>So I will say that waiting for some things to change in order to pick up demand, so our clients will feel better to restock again, and that will push back the wheel to the other direction that we hope will help increase a little bit the prices.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: And [Elor Palma] is asking, I mean, the sort of in the same line to the previous question, but how do you see China's power negotiation considering their pulp inventory currently? And having said that, the Arauco -- power of negotiation of Arauco if you want to add something in that regard?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: Well, as a complement to what I already said, I mean the upper hand in negotiation, of course, is in the hands of clients. And in this case, the Chinese buyers, I think they have exercised their power. That's why prices of hardwood went to the levels that we have discussed, I mean, below $500 in a couple of months. So that's an example of how they use their power and -- especially for hardwood.</p><p>For softwood, they have a little bit less increasing -- the slow increase in supply. So the situation is different, and that's how we are seeing the spread between fibers in more than $200. So of course, our power of negotiation is lower than before because we have supply coming from our side, and the demand is not pushing enough to have some scarcity of the product. So we hope that this situation changes or will get more balanced in the coming months.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: The next one also from Rafael Barcellos asking about capital allocation for the company. If you can provide more color, Rodrigo, on capital allocation for the year? And what are the priorities and what is expected CapEx for 2023?</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Yes, I think we addressed that at least partly during the presentation. We announced the CapEx of $1.8 billion, made up of maintenance for approximately $900 million. Some growth projects in both divisions amounted to $600 million to $700 million, and that has to do with plantations, forests, panel mills that we've announced already. Some plantations at the Sucuri\u00c3\u00ba project as well. Some final equipment, some remnants from MAPA in the Energy division, some optimization of our gas station network, energy transition as well.</p><p>And finally, some efficiency projects in all of our divisions, which have to do with some projects that have been postponed during the pandemic, which will allow us to bring down costs in several operations and become more efficient. So all in all, $1.8 billion, which compares with $2.3 billion for last year. And then I think that -- that is basically the question, Cristian? CapEx allocation.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Yes, right.</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Yes, capital allocation continues to be tackled along the lines that we've announced previously. So in terms of growth going forward and during this year as well, we have defined that we should continue to invest according to our traditional philosophy, which is long-term investments in areas where we have competitive advantages, focused in energy and natural resources, especially forestry. We will be looking for geographies that have good conditions for growing forests as we have done in the past.</p><p>Sucuri\u00c3\u00ba and Zit\u00c3\u00a1cuaro and the projects we have announced in Forestry fit very well with this philosophy. And in Energy, the philosophy is to trying to add as much value as possible to our existing networks and looking for complementary assets that may help us to do so and also to -- for assets that help us to complement what we have in terms of energy transition and business model transformation. So what we have mentioned in electromobility, in solar power generation and in last-mile logistics and so on are good examples of all this.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Still on CapEx. Alfonso Salazar says that the guidance looks still high at $1.9 billion for the year and free cash flow from the pulp division will likely be impacted by the low price. Is there some flexibility to adjust CapEx based on market conditions? And if may be deployed part of this CapEx in the next year?</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Let me take that at a consolidated level, and then I will hand it over to Gianfranco to answer for the Forestry sector as well. At the consolidated level, yes, we do have flexibility, of course. As I mentioned, part of the projects have to do with efficiency projects, which are not being carried out yet, which are not urgent and that were actually postponed during the pandemic. They can continue to be postponed if needed. And together with that, since we announced the sale of Mapco, the portion of CapEx that was allocated to Mapco, which was not -- which was quite relevant actually, around $100 million, we could reevaluate whether we will be going ahead with that or not. So there, you have at least a couple of sources of flexibility regarding the CapEx for this year.</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: In our case, of course, since we have a negative free cash flow. I mean, we're going to -- in terms of adding CapEx, we're going to postpone some of the projects that we can do. We are prioritizing our CapEx program. I think that we're going to be more close to $1 billion rather than $1.2 billion, which is if you apply the percentage of the $1.88 billion to the percentage shown there. Because execution always lags little bit the budget. So I think we're going to be more close to $1 billion. And I think we're doing an exercise of trying to reduce the CapEx program in order to preserve cash and reduce leverage. So that is an effort that we're already doing in our case.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: And Gianfranco -- and this is the final question. If you can provide more detail on the breakdown for CapEx in Forestry this year? And if that CapEx includes the 150 megawatts wind farm project that may be developed?</p><p>GIANFRANCO TRUFFELLO: Well, starting from the end. No, it doesn't include the 150. We don't have plans to spend that amount of money this year. We are still in the process of the environmental approval project and more steps before deciding to commit capital to that. It basically includes plantations. The normal plantations that we do replanting what we harvest and also additional plantation for the growing forest that we are doing in -- for the Sucuri\u00c3\u00ba project in Mato Grosso do Sul. There we are planting about 50,000 hectares a year in order to have the available forest for the project.</p><p>So that probably means about $200 million extra than the normal forestry planting budget. Then you have about probably $300 million to $350 million in the Pulp division because of maintenance, small projects and also some legacy payments of MAPA and then you could have another $200 million in the panel division. So that more or less is the breakdown on -- but this year, we have more on Forestry than we used to have and probably next year also as we grow the forest to be able to start the Sucuri\u00c3\u00ba project.</p><p>CRISTIAN PALACIOS GONZALEZ: Thanks, Gianfranco. At this time, we don't have more questions. So I hand it over to Rodrigo.</p><p>RODRIGO HUIDOBRO ALVARADO: Okay. Thank you all very much for joining us today, and we will be meeting each other at some point during the first weeks of August in order to take a look at the results for the second quarter this year. Thank you very much.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. This does conclude today's presentation.

On April 26, 1986, Chernobyl's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/chernobyl/faqs\">reactor number four melted down as a result of human error</url>, releasing vast quantities of radioactive particles and gases into the surrounding landscape - <url normalizedValue=\"https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/058/28058918.pdf\">400 times more radioactivity</url> to the environment than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Put in place to contain the radioactive contaminants, the exclusion zone also protects the region from human disturbance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apart from a handful of industrial areas, most of the exclusion zone is completely isolated from human activity and appears almost normal. In some areas, where radiation levels have dropped over time, plants and animals have returned in significant numbers.</p><p>Some scientists have suggested the zone has become an Eden for wildlife, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/food-environment/2022/scientists-cant-agree-about-chernobyls-impact-wildlife\">others are skeptical</url> of that possibility. Looks can be deceiving, at least in areas of high radioactivity, where <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.01.008\">bird</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.10.025\">mammal</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0778\">insect</url> population sizes and diversity are significantly lower than in the \"clean\" parts of the exclusion zone. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fzimDsYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra\">I've spent more than 20 years</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/science/nature-adapts-to-chernobyl.html\">working in Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Fukushima, Japan</url>, largely <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110218-024827\">focused on the effects of radiation</url>. I have been asked many times over the past days why Russian forces entered northern Ukraine via this atomic wasteland, and what the environmental consequences of military activity in the zone might be.</p><h>Why invade via Chernobyl?</h><p>In hindsight, the strategic benefits of basing military operations in the Chernobyl exclusion zone seem obvious. It is a large, unpopulated area connected by a paved highway straight to the Ukrainian capital, with few obstacles or human developments along the way. The Chernobyl zone abuts Belarus and is thus immune from attack from Ukrainian forces from the north. The reactor site's industrial area is, in effect, a large parking lot suitable for staging an invading army's thousands of vehicles.</p><p>The power plant site also houses the main <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clean-futures-fund-forced-to-suspend-humanitarian-operations-at-chernobyl-nuclear-power-plant-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-and-capture-of-the-facility-301490882.html\">electrical grid switching network</url> for the entire region. It's possible to turn the lights off in Kyiv from here, even though the power plant itself has not generated any electricity since 2000, when the <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81920&amp;page=1\">last of Chernobyl's four reactors was shut down</url>. Such control over the power supply likely has strategic importance, although Kyiv's electrical needs could probably also be supplied via other nodes on the Ukrainian national power grid. </p><p>The reactor site likely offers considerable protection from aerial attack, given the improbability that Ukrainian or other forces would risk combat on a site containing more than 5.3 million pounds (2.4 million kilograms) of <url normalizedValue=\"https://interestingengineering.com/first-spent-nuclear-fuel-from-chernobyl-is-safely-stored-after-34-years\">radioactive spent nuclear fuel</url>. This is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02416427\">highly radioactive material</url> produced by a nuclear reactor during normal operations. A direct hit on the power plant's spent fuel pools or dry cask storage facilities could release substantially more radioactive material into the environment than the original meltdown and explosions in 1986 and thus cause an environmental disaster of global proportions.</p><h>Environmental risks on the ground in Chernobyl</h><p>The Chernobyl exclusion zone is among the most radioactively contaminated regions on the planet. Thousands of acres surrounding the reactor site have ambient radiation dose rates exceeding typical <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.05.030\">background levels by thousands of times</url>. In parts of the so-called Red Forest near the power plant it's possible to receive a <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/EP2Ycv8j7fA\">dangerous radiation dose</url> in just a few days of exposure. </p><p>Radiation monitoring stations across the Chernobyl zone recorded the first obvious environmental impact of the invasion. Sensors put in place by the UkrainianChernobyl EcoCenter in case of accidents or forest fires showed dramatic jumps in radiation levels along major roads and next to the reactor facilities starting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.saveecobot.com/en/radiation-maps#12/51.3880/30.1048/gamma/comp+cams+fire\">after 9 p.m</url> on Feb. 24, 2022.  That's when Russian invaders reached the area from neighboring Belarus. </p><p>Because the rise in radiation levels was most obvious in the immediate vicinity of the reactor buildings, there was concern that the containment structures had been damaged, although Russian authorities have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-invasion-russian-forces-chernobyl-/31721240.html\">denied this possibility</url>. The sensor network abruptly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.saveecobot.com/en/radiation-maps#12/51.3970/30.1027/gamma/comp+cams+fire\">stopped reporting</url> early on Feb. 25 and did not restart until March 1, 2022, so the full magnitude of disturbance to the region from the troop movements is unclear.</p><p>If, in fact, it was dust stirred up by vehicles and not damage to any containment facilities that caused the rise in radiation readings, and assuming the increase lasted for just a few hours, it's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.livescience.com/what-if-russia-bombed-chernobyl\">not likely to be of long-term concern</url>, as the dust will settle again once troops move through. </p><p>But the Russian soldiers, as well as the Ukrainian power plant workers who have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-chernobyl-russia-intl/index.html\">been held hostage</url>, undoubtedly inhaled some of the blowing dust. Researchers know the dirt in the Chernobyl exclusion zone <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.livescience.com/what-if-russia-bombed-chernobyl\">can contain radionuclides</url> including cesium-137, strontium-90, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1239_web.pdf\">several isotopes of plutonium</url> and uranium, and americium-241. Even at very low levels, they're all <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12723\">toxic, carcinogenic or both if inhaled</url>.</p><h>Possible impacts further afield</h><p>Perhaps the greater environmental threat to the region stems from the potential release to the atmosphere of radionuclides stored in soil and plants should a forest fire ignite.</p><p>Such fires have recently increased in frequency, size and intensity, likely because of climate change, and these fires have released radioactive materials back into the air and <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26062\">and dispersed them far and wide</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1890/14-1227.1\">Radioactive fallout from forest fires</url> may well represent the greatest threat from the Chernobyl site to human populations downwind of the region as well as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110218-024827\">wildlife within the exclusion zone</url>.</p><p>Currently the zone is home to massive amounts of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/08/chernobyl-fires/615067/\">dead trees</url> and debris that could act as fuel for a fire. Even in the absence of combat, military activity - like thousands of troops transiting, eating, smoking and building campfires to stay warm - increases the risk of forest fires.</p><p>It's <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/Manual-for-Survival/\">hard to predict the effects of radioactive fallout</url> on people, but the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/at-chernobyl-and-fukushima-radioactivity-has-seriously-harmed-wildlife-57030\">consequences to flora and fauna</url> have been well documented.

Among them were Jews, Arabs and Druze; men and women; religious and secular, veteran Israelis and new immigrants. They stood shoulder to shoulder, in mutual responsibility, until the bitter end.</p><p>\"In the decade that has passed since the tragedy, we have commemorated those who perished in many ways: Monuments, memorial groves, articles in the media and other initiatives. I especially want to emphasize two points: The first - learning the lessons.</p><p>\"We have allocated more resources and more means to the firefighting and rescue forces. We have developed the principles of fighting extensive fires and we have seen to appropriate training exercises and equipment, which provide a response to various scenarios.</p><p>\"Of course, above everything, in every sense of the word, we established the aerial firefighting squadron in memory of Elad Riven, the youngest of the victims. The aircraft of the 'Elad Squadron' have proven their capabilities and when fires have broken out in recent years, the squadron was there. Our squadron has also cooperated with other countries in our region. When necessary, we help them, and they help us.</p><p>\"The second point - the heritage. The victims of the Carmel disaster are examples of love of humanity, of the people and of the country. Their spirit of voluntarism, mental fortitude and willingness to help their fellow men at personal risk - all of these values are ingrained in the training of those who follow their path, as firefighters, in the Prison Service and in the Israel Police. Determined action - until victory.</p><p>\"Dear - truly dear - families, I know that these people did not come from a vacuum, they came from you. These marvelous people came from you. I know the magnitude of your pain. We embrace you. From the depths of our hearts, we all salute those who perished, whose images will be with us for generations.</p><p>\"May their memories be blessed.</p><p>\"I salute you, and love you.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7338965 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7338965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61MX-XFX1-JC11-11XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001930</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N922140GC</classCode><className>PRISONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00099LS</classCode><className>JEWS &amp; JUDAISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000409</classCode><className>CORRECTIONS WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001175</classCode><className>MOTORCOACHES &amp; BUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>PE000A66T</classCode><className>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX164</classCode><className>JERUSALEM, ISRAEL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC333</classCode><className>ISRAEL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

James, president of Agri-Tech Producers LLC, Columbia, South Carolina, has issued a public comment on the U.S. Department of Agriculture notice entitled \"Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Partnership Program\". The comment was posted on Nov. 1, 2021:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>Given the urgent and time-sensitive need to extract lots of CO 2 from the atmosphere, to avoid the looming Climate Crisis, the USDA should be keenly aware of and supporting initiatives which encourage the planting and the use of the plants and trees that are best, per acre or per year, in capturing CO 2. And, the federal procurement process should incentivize and prioritize the purchase of items and materials made from bio-products which are sequestering captured carbon, giving some priority for those items produced from the highest capturers, so as to encourage their planting.</p><p>However, it is my belief that neither the federal government nor the USDA knows what the best plants and trees are. Therefore, the USDA should quickly determine that ranking.</p><p>With those thoughts and recommendations in mind, using the patented, Combined Remediation Biomass and Bio-Product Production (CRBBP) Process, I invented, one plants and then multi-tasks certain Bio-Crops, like Biomass Sorghum, to do good things for the health and well being of people, the planet, and local communities, less expensively.</p><p>ATP-MD, LLC, my Maryland operating affiliate, with USDA NRCS help, has already successfully demonstrated CRBBP Process plantings, of Biomass Sorghum, as a cost-effective mechanism to extract excess nutrients from farmland, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, to protect aquatic life in the Bay. And, during that effort, we also demonstrated shredded Biomass Sorghum, one of our bio-products, as a superior poultry house bedding.</p><p>Since then, an analysis, conducted by UC Berkeley, shows that Biomass Sorghum will extract 7 tons of CO 2, per acre, per growing season, which is almost 4 times the amount of atmospheric CO 2, as an equal acreage of trees, and 2 times the amount as an equal acreage of switchgrass</p><p>After the Bio-Crops provide multiple environmental services, they are harvested and converted into circular economy bio-products, like bio-based filler powders, which are an alternative to petroleum-derived carbon black, animal bedding and biochar soil amendments. Such fillers compete in the $380 billion US plastics market, and the biochar most efficiently competes in the $8 billion US garden consumables market.</p><p>The CRBBP Process' multi-tasking features share the cost of growing the Bio-Crops across multiple tasks, making the cost of each task, including the provision of environmental services, like CO 2 capture or remediating Brownfield sites, and then, the making of bio-products, lower than it would have been, if the Bio-Crops were grown for a single purpose.</p><p>Regarding an urban application of our CRBBP Process, ATP-MD, LLC, with funding and technical support from the Exelon Foundation's Climate Change Investment Initiative (See: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.exelonfoundation.org/environment.html\">https://www.exelonfoundation.org/environment.html</url>), will be demonstrating and commercializing our CRBBP Process, in Baltimore, where we will be extracting atmospheric CO 2, as our Biomass Sorghum is planted outdoors, to remediate brownfield sites, but roughly 10 times as much, as an equal acreage of trees, when Biomass Sorghum is planted in our proposed Vertical Bio-Crop Farms (VBF's), to capture CO 2 from the flue gasses of power plants and other large emitters. The USDA should support R&amp;D related to the design of , good at capturing CO 2.</p><p>Lastly, I have conceptualized a new and special application, which I call our Forest Fire Mitigation Process, which I believe will help substantially reduce the spread of catastrophic forest fires, capture large amounts of CO 2, to moderate Climate Change, and help stabilize the forest ecosystem. I suggest that our bio-crops been planted, in wide bands, to separate large section of forests from each other, in a manner which would protect against the spread of fire moving from one section of a forest to another, and then be harvested before the peak of fire season, creating fuel-free space between large sections of forest, even after capturing nearly 4 times the amount of CO 2, per acre, as the forest acreage used.</p><p>I hope the USDA, under all of its programs, will offer greater incentives for efforts helping to also combat Climate Change, as we seek to demonstrate how our CRBBP Process can benefit our nation and the world.</p><p>View attachments at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USDA-2021-0010-0207\">https://www.regulations.gov/comment/USDA-2021-0010-0207</url></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Joseph J.

Reports in recent decades have highlighted an increasing number and range expansion of infectious diseases, such as scrub typhus and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [4\u20136]. Scrub typhus (also known as tsutsugamushi disease) is caused by the agent <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Orientia tsutsugamushi</emphasis>, a typical mite-borne bacterial pathogen causing zoonotic disease. It is well established that the larvae of some chigger mites (Actinotrichida: Trombiculidae) serve as the exclusive vector of scrub typhus, which can be transmitted from rodents and other wild animals to humans during the parasitic phase through the feeding canal, i.e. a stylostome [7, 8]. HFRS is a viral zoonosis caused by members of the genus<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Hantavirus</emphasis>, and some chigger species are suspected to be possible vectors of the disease [9].</p><p>Six chigger species belonging to the genus <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrombidium</emphasis>, including<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> L. scutellare</emphasis> (Nagayo et al., 1921), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> (Walch, 1922), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. rubellum</emphasis> Wang and Liao, 1984, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. wenense</emphasis> Wu, Wen, Yang and Wu, 1982, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. insulare</emphasis> Wei, Wang and Tong, 1989 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. sialkotense</emphasis> Vercammen-Grandjean and Langston, 1976, have been confirmed as the main vectors of scrub typhus in mainland China [10]. These mite species are known to occur in Yunnan Province and the adjacent areas, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> being the dominant species [11\u201314]. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrobidium scutellare</emphasis> is considered to be one of the possible vectors of Hantavirus, an emerging zoonotic disease [3, 15\u201317]. No longer than a decade ago, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> was mostly reported in northern China where it was considered to be the main vector of scrub typhus, occurring at latitudes higher than 31\u00b0 N [8, 18]. However, field observations in the last decade demonstrated an extensive distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in the provinces of southwest China [19, 20], effectively challenging the notion that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> was the main vector of scrub typhus in the region [18]. The outcomes of these observations prompted more efforts in studying the distribution and epidemic relevance of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. A better understanding of the distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> may provide knowledge contribution to the prevention of associated diseases and benefit public health interventions.</p><p>Recently, considerable efforts have been made to better understand the distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and its role in disease transmission. It has been reported that the presence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and the epidemic incidence of scrub typhus were identical in South Korea [21]. These results suggest that changes in the distribution of the vector may affect the corresponding epidemic patterns. A recent study outlined the potential distribution range under simulated future environments of the two most widely distributed vector chiggers <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in mainland China [22]. Another study mapping the distributions of blood-sucking mites and mite-borne agents also indicated that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> harbors the highest variety of pathogens [23], which is turn increases the exposure risk to relevant diseases for the human population where the vector species occurs.</p><p>Although these earlier studies contributed significant data towards improving our knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of chigger vectors, they relied on the presence data of the mites with coordinates extracted from center points of the corresponding administrative areas, i.e., the counties [24]. Thus, these projections may underestimate the heterogeneity of environmental suitability for the species within the areas, especially when field observations have shown that mites such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> showed specialized habitat preference, i.e. uncultivated habitats at mid to high elevations [12, 25]. Taking environmental differences within the sampled areas into account when evaluating the distribution may improve the performance of ecological models. Such an attempt is realistic only when the collection site is accurately documented. So far, the occurrence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in southwest China has been reported at the county level [19, 24]. The suitable area and potential distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in southwest China have not been exhaustively discussed, and the interactions between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and anthropic activities, such as cropping, logging or tourism, are unexplored. Also, the epidemic role of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in mite-borne disease prevalence in southwest China is unclear.</p><p>Based on the occurrence data of chigger mites collected continuously in 21 years of field investigations, we explored three main questions: (i) what is the potential distribution range of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in the study area under near current and future climate scenarios; (ii) how much does the distribution range of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> overlap with human activities; and (iii) does the potential distribution range of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> explain the prevalence of scrub typhus and HFRS in the study region (see the workflow in Fig. 1). Through these efforts, we aimed to evaluate the exposure risk to scrub typhus and HFRS from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces on both spatial and temporal scales.Fig. 1</p><p>Workflow of the present study</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>The study was conducted in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, two adjacent provinces in southwest China. The uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau resulted in the formation of various mountain ranges in this region and, consequently, an extremely high heterogeneity in its topography and climate (Fig. 2). Elevation generally increases from the southeast to northwest, with the mean annual temperature decreasing in the same direction. Moisture delivered by the seasonal monsoon causes a decline in precipitation from west to east. Based on these variations, the study area covers almost all types of existing climates worldwide, from wet or dry tropical to alpine tundra [26]. The western part of the study region is dominated by a spectacular mountain-valley system with vast elevational differences (between 76 and 7556 m a.s.l.), which is known as the Longitudinal Range and Gorge Region of southwest China [27]. Various vegetation types are distributed among this mountain-valley system, including humid evergreen broad-leaved forest and semi-arid bushes along the valleys, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and dark coniferous forest on mid- and high-elevation slopes, and meadows and tundra in alpine areas. Eastern Sichuan is marked by a low-elevation basin (250\u2013700 m a.s.l.) surrounded by mountains (1000\u20133000 m a.s.l.). This basin occupies approximately 33% of the area of Sichuan Province and is mostly covered by subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest except for the areas with human modifications. The western Sichuan area is formed by a vast plateau with an average elevation of &gt; 4000 m a.s.l., which is predominantly covered by oak bushes, meadows and scree. The dark coniferous forest can also be seen in a few valleys in this area. Eastern and middle Yunnan Province is generally dominated by mountainous highlands (approx. 2000 m a.s.l.). Mixed broadleaf-conifer forests are widely distributed in these highlands. Low-elevation plains and hills predominantly constitute the topography in southern Yunnan (&lt; 1000 m a.s.l.), which is generally covered by tropical rainforest and humid evergreen broad-leaved forest. Human settlements and croplands are spread over the valleys, plateaus and low-elevation plains in the study region.Fig. 2</p><p>Map showing the topography of the study area and sampling points investigated for the presence/absence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrombidium scutellare</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Field sampling and occurrence data of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Field sampling was conducted in 149 sites across 69 counties in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces from 2001 to 2021. Animal hosts were collected in cage traps (18 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 9 cm; Guixi Mousetrap Apparatus Factory, Guixi, Jiangxi, China) baited with fresh peanuts, corn or other standard baits [28]. Chiggers were collected from the body surface of each host separately, following a standardized protocol [29]. The collected chiggers were mounted on glass slides in Hoyer\u2019s medium and identified under an optical microscope. The specimen vouchers are deposited in the specimen repository of the Institute of Pathogens and Vectors, Dali University, China. A total of 178,942 chiggers were collected and subsequently identified as 302 species, with 1053 individuals of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> determined to be present in 40 of the 149 investigated sampling sites (Fig. 2).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Environmental variables</emphasis></p><p>The distribution range and population persistence of chigger mites have been found to be determined by climate factors and landscape [7, 12, 29, 30]. However, there is no consensus on which climate factor is the most important. To estimate the species-environment relationship and map the potential distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>, layers of 19 bioclimatic variables relating to temperature and precipitation measures spanning 1970\u20132000 were downloaded from the Worldclim 2.1 web server (for full description for the 19 bio-climate variables, see <url normalizedValue=\"https://worldclim.org/data/index.html\">https://worldclim.org/data/index.html</url>). The \u2018select07\u2019 function in the \u2018mecofun\u2019 package was then used to identify the most important climate variables and reduce multi-collinearity [31]. A linear regression model was imposed on these variables to evaluate their explanatory power (adjusted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">R</emphasis>2) on the occurrence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>.</p><p>Land cover types (e.g. type of vegetation) were considered a predominant determinant of chigger occurrences in previous studies [12, 32, 33]. We obtained land cover data indexing cropland, shrubland, grassland or forest from a global land use dataset (1-km resolution) [34]. Multiple ecological factors can vary dramatically along the elevational gradient [35, 36]. For <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>, field observation data suggested that elevations between 2000 and 2500 m a.s.l. were the preferred range [12]. Thus, we included elevation as a synthesis variable representing any undefined factors. We used the 30-s resolution elevational layer from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission downloaded from the Worldclim 2.1 web server.</p><p>For future scenarios, we incorporated the projections based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) [37] for climate variables and the Cellular Automata models for land cover change [34]. The CMIP6 replaced the previously used Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with the updated Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). Four SSPs scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5) have levels of radiative forcing that correspond with the RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) [38]. The BCC-CSM2-MR climate model (a high-resolution climate system model released by the Beijing Climate Center [BCC]) has been found to outperform other general circulation models in certain parameters [39, 40]. Thus, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 derived from the model were selected to simulate moderate and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, respectively. The layers containing future climate projections (2050, as a climatology computed from 2041\u20132060; 2090, as a climatology computed from 2081\u20132100) were also obtained from the Worldclim 2.1 web server. The 30-s resolution land cover layers of the years 2050 and 2090 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were obtained from Li et al. [34]. Ultimately, elevation and bioclimatic layers comprising two future periods (2050 and 2090) under moderate (SSP2-4.5 or RCP4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5 or RCP8.5) greenhouse scenarios were used for future distribution projection. All eco-geographic layers were cropped by the extent of Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, respectively, and resampled to 30 s when necessary for further assessments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Model fitting and distribution projection</emphasis></p><p>Environmental variables were extracted from the selected layers of the near-current period by the presence-absence points with the \u2018extract\u2019 function provided by the \u2018terra\u2019 package [41]. We fitted a boosted regression tree (BRT) ecological model based on a case-control research strategy for species distribution modeling [42]. The data points of the investigated sites were assigned as \u201ccases\u201d when <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> is present (1) and \u201ccontrols\u201d when the species is absent (0). Of all data points, 75% were extracted randomly as a training set, and the remaining 25% were treated as a test set [23]. The training set was used to build a BRT model and to acquire the relative contributions of the variables using the \u2018gbm.step\u2019 function provided in the \u2018dismo\u2019 package [43]. The model was run with a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0.005 and a bagging fraction of 75% based on the satisfactory performance in previous practice runs [23, 44]. Tenfold cross-validation was adopted to produce the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The model performance and predicted power were evaluated by the areas under the curve (AUC). The AUC of the fitted model was derived with the \u2018evalSDM\u2019 function available in the \u2018mecofun\u2019 package using the test set for validation [31]. The training set extraction, BRT model fitting and predictive performance evaluation were repeated 100 times. We averaged the values provided by the repetitions to increase the robustness of the modeling performance [22].</p><p>For each focused scenario and period, the occurrence probability was predicted based on the BRT model products of 100 repetitions with the \u2018predict.gbm\u2019 function available in the \u2018gbm\u2019 package [45]. The outputs were also averaged for geographical mapping. The \u2018evalSDM\u2019 function also returns a cut-off value (threshold) based on the maximum sensitivity+specificity along the ROC curve that can be used to translate the predicted probabilities of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> into binary levels [31]. Pixels with probabilities beyond the threshold were considered suitable (1), while those below the threshold were considered unsuitable (0) for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> to map the binarizing occurrence patterns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Relating occurrence probability with human activities and mite-borne diseases</emphasis></p><p>The Human Footprint index shows the gradient of human activities [46]. It is a weighted sum of maps of where people live (population density) and the accessibility to different areas (e.g. infrastructure). We downloaded the layer mapping the Human Footprint for the year 2020, released by the Wildlife Conservation Society (<url normalizedValue=\"https://wcshumanfootprint.org/data-access\">https://wcshumanfootprint.org/data-access</url>), and then re-sampled (bilinear interpolation) the Human Footprint layer to 30 s. We calculated the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the Human Footprint index and the occurrence probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> under near-current and future projections with the \u2018raster.cor.matrix\u2019 function provided in the \u2018ENMTools\u2019 package [47].</p><p>Finally, we fitted linear regression models to evaluate the explanatory power of the occurrence probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> for the mite-borne disease frequencies in recent decades. Because case reports for the mite-borne disease were not publicly available for Sichuan Province, in the present study we only analyzed data on Yunnan Province. An area with more suitable habitats for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> should have a higher occurrence probability and, consequently, a higher infection rate for mite-borne diseases. We first averaged the predicted probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> at the city level and then derived the epidemiological patterns of mite-borne diseases from published literature. We obtained the case reports of scrub typhus in Yunnan Province during the period 2006\u20132017 [5]. The case reports of HFRS in Yunnan Province had been aggregated by the periods 1976\u20132012 [48] and 2014\u20132015 [49]. The number of case reports was used as a response variable, and the probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> was used as an explanatory factor when fitting the linear regression models.

This result is in contrast with those of a recent study in which it was found that elevation contributed little (no more than 5%) to the species in their models [22]. This difference can be explained by the fact that our point data contains more accurate information on the presence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> along the elevational gradients. The mountainous areas of southwest China are marked by a vast variation in elevation [27], with corresponding variations in environmental factors, such as temperature, water resources, vegetation cover and soil chemistry [36]. Such variations in elevation have been found to impact the distribution of small mammal hosts [52] and their ectoparasitic species [25]. Our results are in line with the previous finding that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> prefers mid- to high-elevation habitats [12], further highlighting the important influence of topography in the distribution of the species.</p><p>Climate variables constituted a considerable portion of the contribution to predicting the occurrence pattern. Findings from previous studies suggested a negative correlation between temperature and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> presence [53, 54]. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrombidium scutellare</emphasis> is known to be widely distributed in northern China, which is colder in winter compared to the southern regions of the country [24, 55]. The species is also known to be more active during the cold seasons and to act as the main vector of scrub typhus in southern China during winter [18, 56]. Thus, an area with a cold winter in low latitudes may represent optimization of the environmental suitability for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. The high contribution of precipitation seasonality to predicting the occurrence pattern of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> may be attributed to the life history traits as it has been noted that rainfall heavily influences the reproduction and growth of this chigger species, as well as that of many other species [57]. Overall, the results of the present study support the view that the occurrence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> is highly sensitive to climatic and topographic heterogeneity [7, 12].</p><p>Land cover variables explained only a small portion of the occurrence pattern (&lt; 9%). It has been suggested that there is no consistent effect of land covers such as woodlands, scrublands, hedgerows and grasslands on the abundance of pests and pathogens and that land cover has a small effect compared to climate [58]. Our results support the idea that climate generally outweighs land covers in determining the occurrence of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. Previous studies supported a higher prevalence of chiggers in densely vegetated lands [2, 32]. Our results showed that croplands and forests are generally more suitable for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> than shrublands and grasslands. There are a number of possible explanations for this result. Firstly, forest and cropland constitute most of the land cover area in the study region, with shrublands and grasslands appearing only as small patches amidst them. Secondly, the local people in southwest China have developed unique cropping methods due to the mountainous terrain, and these differ from those used in flat plains; for example, people in southwest China developed the famous terrace farming to cultivate crops alongside mountainous forest habitats. This cropping method may create a transitional zone that is favored by small mammal hosts and their ectoparasitic chiggers. A similar positive correlation has been reported between scrub typhus incidence and Taiwan's mosaic landscapes of cropland and forest [59].</p><p>The geographical projection showed that under the near-current period scenario, plateau and high-elevation mountains are generally more suitable than plains and valleys. These results suggest that people living in mountainous areas likely have higher transmission risks related to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. The occurrence probabilities of suitable areas for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces decreased with increasing greenhouse effect, possibly because this species prefers a colder environment compared to other vector mite species in Yunnan Province [60, 61]. Therefore, under future temperature increases, the range of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> may contract to high-elevation mountains. Such a tendency was also reported in other mountain-dwelling species, especially those adapted to cold temperatures and high-elevation habitats, for example, the Himalayan coldwater specialist snow trout (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Schizothorax richardsonii</emphasis>) [62] and herbages restricted to alpine habitats [63]. However, our results are in contrast with a previous projection in the distribution tendency. A recent study found that both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> had broader suitability ranges in the high RCP scenario, suggesting a future northward expansion of geographic distribution [22]. This discrepancy may be attributed to their occurrence points not representing the preferable elevation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> [24]. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrombidium scutellare</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> can co-exist in a given area yet occupy different elevations and landscapes [12, 19]. Thus, including accurate environmental information on the collection site in the ecological model may improve our understanding of environmental suitability for the species.</p><p>Despite the difference in directions, our results are in agreement with previous studies in regarding that the greenhouse effect may optimize habitat suitability in a colder environment, i.e. high elevation or high latitude. Combined, our results of the distribution mapping study indicate that increased temperature may drive the upward or northward shifts for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> to pursue a more suitable habitat [64, 65]. Moreover, although the potential distribution range of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> may be reduced in the future, the temperature rise may expand the suitable habitats for other vector mites, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. rubellum</emphasis>, which favor warmer conditions. For example, opposite responses to climate change were detected between two small mammal hosts in the mountains of southwest China [66].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluation of the risks introduced by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>The results of the present study indicate a low correlation between the potential distribution patterns of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and the Human Footprint index in the near-current period. This result is due to the preference of this species for a mountainous uncultivated landscape and because it is primarily parasitic on hosts that live in the wilderness [12, 56]. Studies in South Korea [33] and Thailand [32] suggested that human disturbance and urbanization may mitigate the risk of rickettsioses transmission because the vector chiggers generally prefer habitats less modified by people. Nevertheless, the increasing occurrence probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> may increase the infection risk for people living in high-elevation areas. These people may have a higher opportunity to engage the vector due to their residences and activity patterns being close to the suitable habitats of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. On the other hand, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> was found to peak in population size in cold seasons [7] and was noted to act as the main vector of autumn-winter-type scrub typhus [67]. The forest fire-safe periods in winter and spring, which forbid most human entry into the mountainous areas in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces, may help to reduce the exposure risk. The interactions between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and human activities were expected to decline gradually under future scenarios due to the contraction of suitable habitats. It is worth noting that these results were valid only in a certain context because they were built on the assumption that the intensity of anthropic activities remains constant for the following decades. However, the contraction of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> range does not necessarily correspond to a low exposure risk [44] because other vectors that coexist in the study region may expand their distribution under climate change scenarios [22, 66]. Therefore, a study on a multi-species level focusing on the study region is needed to improve the evaluation of exposure risk to mite-borne diseases.</p><p>Our results showed that the occurrence probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> did not explain the incidence of scrub typhus in Yunnan Province. As such, our findings are not in agreement with those of a study in South Korea that suggested a congruent pattern between the mapped distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and the incidence of scrub typhus [21]. A plausible explanation for our results is that the distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> was mostly restricted to less urbanized areas in southwest China. This leads to a confined influence of the species on the majority of the human population. The incidences of scrub typhus were mostly reported in cities representative of the low-elevation areas of southern Yunnan [5]. These cities were also likely favored by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. deliense</emphasis>\u2014another major <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">O. tsustugamushi</emphasis> vector adapted to warmth and low elevation [61]. However, high suitability for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in the plateaus of Yunnan Province may still drive the increasing trend of scrub typhus in these areas, such as in Kunming and Dali [5, 68].</p><p>We found strong support for a positive correlation between the occurrence probability of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and the incidence of HFRS in Yunnan Province. This result highlights the potential for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> playing a considerable role in HFRS transmission. The hantavirus has been segregated from multiple small mammal hosts in the wild, including members of the genera <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Apodemus</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eothenomys</emphasis> [69, 70]. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leptotrombidium scutellare</emphasis> has been reported to be a dominant ectoparasitic species on these hosts [12]. It is worth noting that to date the epidemiological evidence of transmission of HFRS through <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> remained unsatisfactory [56]. Thus, more research may be needed to establish a straightforward association between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and HFRS.</p><p>Our analysis encountered several unavoidable limitations. Many areas in the study region have not been adequately investigated. Thus, more surveillance efforts in the future are required to increase our knowledge of the actual distribution of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> and other potential vector mites. The predictions of exposure risk were based on the human activity data available for the contemporary period. This interaction may be exacerbated or mitigated depending on the forest management policy, the progress of urbanization and the development of farming, tourism and infrastructure construction. We could not address the correlations between the occurrence of the chigger with relevant diseases such as scrub typhus and HFRS in Sichuan Province. Further study should target such an issue to better understand the role of potential vectors underlying the epidemic patterns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Our results showed that people living in high-elevation areas are likely exposed to mite-borne diseases transmitted by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis>. Future climate change is expected to reduce the suitable areas for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare</emphasis> in Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces. Such range shifts may mitigate the range overlap between humans and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L. scutellare.</emphasis> We found that the occurrence probability of the species yielded contrasting associations between different mite-borne diseases, emphasizing the necessity of more study to understand the underlying epidemiological mechanisms.

Not surprisingly, the film is really about our refusal to recognize the \"existential threat\" of \"manmade climate change.\"\u00a0<br/>Director Adam McKay recently tweeted, \"We've got 6-8 years before the climate is so chaotic we [will] live in a permanent state of biblical catastrophe.\"\u00a0<br/>Not to be outdone, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the latest UN climate report \"a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world.\" Drilling for more oil and gas is \"moral and economic madness,\" he insisted. If humanity doesn't stop using fossil fuels, we will be overwhelmed by devastating floods, heat waves, droughts, fires and crop failures.\u00a0<br/>Global sea levels have already risen \"a shocking nine inches,\" the PurpleOrange PR Agency proclaimed, promoting a client's Climate Neutral Certified label, which is designed to channel more money to \"authentic, immediate climate action.\"\u00a0<br/>Back on the non-parallel-universe Planet Earth, a truly unlivable world would be one without fossil fuels. </p><p>Not just to generate electricity, cook food, heat homes and water, and power cars, boats, trains and planes - but for fertilizers and insecticides to grow more food on less land, and for plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics, clothing and other essential products. For us today; for billions more tomorrow.<br/>Fossil fuels to extract and process trillions of tons of raw materials, too, and manufacture the millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and millions of transmission line towers that would blanket our croplands, scenic areas and wildlife habitats if we didn't have fossil fuels.\u00a0<br/>In fact, far worse than a warmer planet with more airborne plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide would be a colder planet with less CO2. That would mean less arable land, shorter growing seasons and much lower crop yields, on top of losses from a devastated Ukraine and sanctioned Russian wheat crops.\u00a0<br/>(Why is it that Twitter twits never cancel, suppress or even fact-check climate fear porn? Why is it never just climate\u00a0change, but always climate cataclysms? Why always manmade climate change, as though past natural climate changes never happened? Why do Guterres, Gore, Kerry, Biden and AOC always have to top his, her, hir, ver, zir fellow alarmists in hysteria? Why is the fear-mongering always based on computer models, never on actual data and evidence? Why does it always ignore China's massive fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions?)\u00a0<br/>One of the prevalent climate alarm themes is sea level rise.\u00a0<br/>Back on real Earth, if the DC Swamp inhabitants of 35 million years ago had looked up, they'd have been transfixed in their last moments by a non-special-effects meteor hurtling into what is now Cape Charles, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The 2-mile-wide meteor obliterated and pulverized sediments and bedrock, vaporized plants and animals, sent rock fragments hundreds of miles in every direction, and launched tsunamis into West Virginia's eastern mountain slopes.\u00a0<br/>Shattered rock settled back into a crater 4,300 feet deep and 53 miles in diameter. Over the ensuing millennia, river and ocean sediments poured into the crater - and mile-high glaciers pulled 10-million cubic miles of water out of the oceans, burying half of North America, Europe and Asia under trillions of tons of ice. Land under the ice was pressed down, while land outside the glacial zones was lifted up. Then, some 12,000 years ago, the last Pleistocene glaciers began melting.\u00a0<br/>Oceans slowly rose - some 400 feet! Land masses underwent \"isostatic rebound.\" Areas that had been under the ice began rising; those that had bulged upward began sinking. In much of the Chesapeake Bay region, post-glacial subsidence is compounded by continued compression of pulverized crater rock - and by the ongoing withdrawal of groundwater from sedimentary aquifers beneath urban and agricultural areas that depend on groundwater.\u00a0<br/>The aquifers include layers of porous sandstone (with water between sand grains) interspersed among layers of impermeable but water-soaked shale and clay. As water is pumped out of the sandy layers, the shale-clay layers get squeezed by hundreds of feet of overlying rock and sediment, and their water is forced into the sandstones, and then into pumps. The overlying land steadily subsides.\u00a0<br/>In the Chesapeake Bay area, subsidence averages nearly 3 mm/year; 11.5 inches per century. That's in addition to almost 4.5 inches per century in isostatic subsidence, plus 7 to 9 inches per century in actual sea level rise. The total perceived sea level rise can be 24 inches per century - although two-thirds of that total has nothing to do with actual sea level rise. Indeed, the Norfolk Naval Station tide gauge at Sewell's Point shows that the rate of actual sea level rise has not changed since the gauge was installed in 1927.\u00a0<br/>The situation in Houston-Galveston, Texas, Santa Clara Valley, California, and other places around the globe is similarly complicated, even without post-glaciation issues. To single out actual sea level rise - and blame the rise on humans and fossil fuels - is simply disingenuous.\u00a0<br/>However, salt-water intrusion and coastal flooding are serious, recurrent, growing problems, especially during hurricanes and as more expensive homes are built along coasts. Some communities have slowed subsidence by relocating groundwater pumping stations away from the coast, reducing withdrawal rates, increasing aquifer recharge, or substituting surface water for groundwater. Others have installed sea walls, improved drainage systems, and pipelines to bring water from nearby lakes and rivers. Other options include desalination plants to create more fresh water, recycling household \"gray water\" to agricultural use, and switching to less water-intensive irrigation methods, as Israel does.\u00a0<br/>These approaches are far more practical and cost-effective than trying to stop seas from rising any further, like a modern King Canute, by banning fossil fuels, especially if it's done only in some Western nations.\u00a0<br/>Meanwhile, inhabitants of Tuvalu, the Maldives and other Pacific islands and coral atolls worry about rising seas due to fossil fuels. However, most of them are increasing in land area, not decreasing - as corals grow, sediments are laid down off their coasts, and volcanic lava flows expand land masses.\u00a0<br/>Moreover, few of these islands and coral reefs even existed 12,000 years ago, when the Wisconsin Glaciation extracted 400 feet of seawater from the world's oceans. The islands and atolls began growing as the seas rose. They've continued growing with every additional foot of sea level rise since the last Ice Age and the Little Ice Age (1350-1850) - and show no signs of stopping.\u00a0<br/>Cosquer Cave's Paleolithic paintings near Marseille, France (the entrance is 115 feet below current sea level) and a Mel Fisher dive team's discovery of\u00a0charred tree branches and pine cones from a\u00a0forest fire\u00a08,400 years ago in 40 feet of water off the Florida coast further attest to steadily rising seas.\u00a0<br/>Yet, experts tell us. (1) \"Snows are less frequent and less deep. The rivers scarcely ever freeze over now. There is an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold in the spring, which is very fatal to fruits.\" (2) \"We were astonished by the total absence of ice in Barrow Strait. I was here at this time [six years ago] - still frozen up - and doubts were entertained as to the possibility of escape.\" (3) \"The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot.\"\u00a0<br/>It behooves to take action. Or perhaps not. Quotation (1) is from Thomas Jefferson's diary, 1799; (2) from Sir Francis McClintock's ship's log, 1860; (3) from a Washington Post article, November 2, 1922.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Instead of parroting scare stories - and demanding that fossil fuels be replaced by pseudo-clean, pseudo-renewable energy - it really behooves us to think, analyze, ponder the many ways fossil fuels improve our lives, and demand real evidence instead of GIGO computer models for any supposed climate crisis.\u00a0<br/>Photo by Kevin Gill, Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0).<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-160153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:656X-8P21-JCG7-83JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1391\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 Heartland Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Heartland Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 12, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Not surprisingly, the film is really about our refusal to recognize the \"existential threat\" of \"manmade climate change.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Director Adam McKay recently tweeted, \"We've got 6-8 years before the climate is so chaotic we [will] live in a permanent state of biblical catastrophe.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not to be outdone, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the latest UN climate report \"a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world.\" Drilling for more oil and gas is \"moral and economic madness,\" he insisted. If humanity doesn't stop using fossil fuels, we will be overwhelmed by devastating floods, heat waves, droughts, fires and crop failures.</p><p>Global sea levels have already risen \"a shocking nine inches,\" the PurpleOrange PR Agency proclaimed, promoting a client's Climate Neutral Certified label, which is designed to channel more money to \"authentic, immediate climate action.\"</p><p>Back on the non-parallel-universe Planet Earth, a truly unlivable world would be one without fossil fuels. Not just to generate electricity, cook food, heat homes and water, and power cars, boats, trains and planes but for fertilizers and insecticides to grow more food on less land, and for plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics, clothing and other essential products. For us today; for billions more tomorrow.</p><p>Fossil fuels to extract and process trillions of tons of raw materials, too, and manufacture the millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and millions of transmission line towers that would blanket our croplands, scenic areas and wildlife habitats if we didn't have fossil fuels.</p><p>In fact, far worse than a warmer planet with more airborne plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide would be a colder planet with less CO2. That would mean less arable land, shorter growing seasons and much lower crop yields, on top of losses from a devastated Ukraine and sanctioned Russian wheat crops.</p><p>(Why is it that Twitter twits never cancel, suppress or even fact-check climate fear porn? Why is it never just climate change, but always climate cataclysms? Why always manmade climate change, as though past natural climate changes never happened? Why do Guterres, Gore, Kerry, Biden and AOC always have to top his, her, hir, ver, zir fellow alarmists in hysteria? Why is the fear-mongering always based on computer models, never on actual data and evidence? Why does it always ignore China's massive fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions?)</p><p>One of the prevalent climate alarm themes is sea level rise.</p><p>Back on real Earth, if the DC Swamp inhabitants of 35 million years ago had looked up, they'd have been transfixed in their last moments by a non-special-effects meteor hurtling into what is now Cape Charles, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The 2-mile-wide meteor obliterated and pulverized sediments and bedrock, vaporized plants and animals, sent rock fragments hundreds of miles in every direction, and launched tsunamis into West Virginia's eastern mountain slopes.</p><p>Shattered rock settled back into a crater 4,300 feet deep and 53 miles in diameter. Over the ensuing millennia, river and ocean sediments poured into the crater and mile-high glaciers pulled 10-million cubic miles of water out of the oceans, burying half of North America, Europe and Asia under trillions of tons of ice. Land under the ice was pressed down, while land outside the glacial zones was lifted up. Then, some 12,000 years ago, the last Pleistocene glaciers began melting.</p><p>Oceans slowly rose some 400 feet!

Fire crews managed to stop its movement there but additional evacuations were ordered for the western Antelope Valley.</p><p>In one dramatic moment, several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them.</p><p>The so-called Lake Fire was just 12% contained as of Saturday morning, and after threatening more than 5,400 homes, it had charred more than 23 square miles (59.5 square kilometers) of brush and trees. Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed, including at least five homes.</p><p>The blaze was in the Angeles National Forest near Lake Hughes.</p><p>Firefighters were struggling in steep, rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures. The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees (44 Celsius) in the Antelope Valley Saturday, and winds gusting 15-20 mph (24-32 kph) was expected later in the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to that, we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that's going to allow for a pyrocumulus (cloud) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior,\u201d NWS meteorologist Matt Mehle said.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend, with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state. There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts, fire officials said</p><p>There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa. It churned through 2.3 square miles (5.96 square kilometers) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes. Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday.</p><p>Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire. He was identified as Osmin Palencia, 36, and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started.</p><p>Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him.</p><p>Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighborhood in the city of Corona, east of Los Angeles, before crews controlled it. And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse, near Sacramento, burned about 500 acres (202 hectares) before firefighters stopped its forward spread.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-567e3271d97ebb1cd74f69c7c9d11b3e20200815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KM-PW21-JC5B-G1X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><timeReceived>5:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The graphs show PM2.5 concentrations (microgram per cubic meter), with the x-axis as measured by the regulatory monitor in downtown Berkeley and the y-axis as measured by PurpleAir monitors. On the good air day, the numbers were roughly the same. However, when wildfire smoke was present the PurpleAir readings were consistently far higher than the regulatory monitor's. (Photo credit: Kelly J. Owen/Berkeley Lab)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last few years of frequent and intense wildfire seasons, many parts of the U.S. have experienced hazardous air quality for days on end. At the same time a number of low-cost air quality monitors have come on the market, allowing consumers to check the pollutant levels in their own homes and neighborhoods. So, air quality scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) wanted to know: are these low-cost monitors any good?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The answer is: yes to a degree.</p><p>Published recently in the journal Sensors, their study tested four models of low-cost air quality monitors during actual wildfire pollution events and found that their readings of PM2.5 or particulate matter under 2.5 microns, which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues were consistently higher than the reference monitor used by the regulatory agencies; however, since each monitor had a relatively consistent response to the smoke, it is possible to use the readings to estimate true PM2.5 levels. Overall, the researchers concluded that the monitors can provide actionable information.</p><p>\"We compared the low-cost monitors to one that is used by regulatory agencies in air monitoring stations. It turns out their correlations are phenomenally good. When one goes up, the other goes up at the same time, and it is proportional. That gives us a lot of hope for being able to use them for real information,\" said Woody Delp, one of the lead authors of the study. \"And it could let someone know how well their new portable air filter is reducing smoke particles. But from an absolute point of view, it's becoming clear these sensors require some adjustments and checks to use the numbers.\"</p><p>For the study, titled \"Wildfire Smoke Adjustment Factors for Low-Cost and Professional PM2.5 Monitors with Optical Sensors,\" Delp and co-author Brett Singer tested four low-cost air quality monitors:</p><p>IQAir AirVisual Pro</p><p>PurpleAir Indoor</p><p>Air Quality Egg</p><p>eLichens Indoor Air Quality Pro station</p><p>These devices, which cost in the range of a few hundred dollars, were compared to reference monitors used by regulatory agencies and researchers, which cost $20,000 or more. They also tested two monitors that are used by researchers and industrial hygienists and cost in the range of $5,000 to $10,000. Additionally, the researchers compared public data from PurpleAir PA-II monitors to nearby regulatory monitoring stations impacted by four wildfires in 2018.</p><p>Calibrations and adjustment factors</p><p>In the past, air quality monitoring has been limited to the high-priced professional monitors, making them inaccessible for personal use. The manufacturers recommend that the devices be calibrated to the specific pollution source of interest because the sensors use an optical sensing technique that responds differently to different sources. Pollution from a backyard barbecue or car exhaust may differ in size and density from pollution from a forest fire, and a forest fire may emit different types of particles than an urban fire.</p><p>The low-cost monitors use the same optical sensing technique estimating particle concentrations based on light scattering but use mass-produced optical sensors that are not as precisely machined as those in the professional-grade devices. In contrast, the most expensive monitors, those used by regulatory agencies, are calibrated using gravimetric analysis, which is based on the weight of particles.</p><p>With the air quality monitors deployed at Berkeley Lab inside a well-ventilated single-story laboratory building, the researchers collected data as the Camp Fire burned in Northern California in the fall of 2018. They found that the four low-cost monitors substantially overreported PM2.5 levels, by factors of 1.6 to 2.4 times higher than the readings on the regulatory reference monitor. However, the relative changes correlated well with both the regulatory and professional monitors.</p><p>The researchers calculated an adjustment factor of approximately 0.48 when using PurpleAir PA-II monitors outdoors during the Camp, Carr, and Mendocino Complex Fires in California and the Pole Creek Fire in Utah (meaning the readings should be multiplied by 0.48 to estimate the true PM2.5 level). This correction is very close to one of the data conversion options (\"LRAPA\") given on the PurpleAir website.</p><p>Good for other indoor pollutants too</p><p>In a separate study earlier this year, Delp and Singer, along with first author Zhiqiang Wang, evaluated six low-cost air quality monitors by comparing their output to reference PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from 21 common residential sources, such as frying, grilling, microwaving popcorn, vacuuming, and burning candles. The study, published in the journal Building and Environment, was an update to their 2018 study.</p><p>They found that for most pollution sources, the low-cost monitors tracked with the professional ones within a factor of two for PM2.5. Delp said the consumer monitors \"enable people to identify activities that emit fine particulate matter inside their homes and to determine if operating filters or just keeping windows closed is effectively reducing exposure inside when there is very bad air pollution outside. For these purposes, they work as well as professional grade monitors, and appear to be very reliable.\"</p><p>\"We are impressed and excited by the usefulness and performance of these air quality monitors that cost under $300,\" said Singer, head of the Indoor Environment Group in Berkeley Lab's Energy Technologies Area.</p><p>Both studies were supported by the Department of Energy's Building Technologies Office and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Indoor Environments Division.</p><p># # #</p><p>Founded in 1931 on the belief that the biggest scientific challenges are best addressed by teams, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and its scientists have been recognized with 13 Nobel Prizes.

Not surprisingly, the film is really about our refusal to recognize the \"existential threat\" of \"manmade climate change.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Director Adam McKay recently tweeted, \"We've got 6-8 years before the climate is so chaotic we [will] live in a permanent state of biblical catastrophe.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not to be outdone, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the latest UN climate report \"a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world.\" Drilling for more oil and gas is \"moral and economic madness,\" he insisted. If humanity doesn't stop using fossil fuels, we will be overwhelmed by devastating floods, heat waves, droughts, fires and crop failures.</p><p>Global sea levels have already risen \"a shocking nine inches,\" the PurpleOrange PR Agency proclaimed, promoting a client's Climate Neutral Certified label, which is designed to channel more money to \"authentic, immediate climate action.\"</p><p>Back on the non-parallel-universe Planet Earth, a truly unlivable world would be one without fossil fuels. Not just to generate electricity, cook food, heat homes and water, and power cars, boats, trains and planes &amp;ndash; but for fertilizers and insecticides to grow more food on less land, and for plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics, clothing and other essential products. For us today; for billions more tomorrow.</p><p>Fossil fuels to extract and process trillions of tons of raw materials, too, and manufacture the millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and millions of transmission line towers that would blanket our croplands, scenic areas and wildlife habitats if we didn't have fossil fuels.</p><p>In fact, far worse than a warmer planet with more airborne plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide would be a colder planet with less CO2. That would mean less arable land, shorter growing seasons and much lower crop yields, on top of losses from a devastated Ukraine and sanctioned Russian wheat crops.</p><p>(Why is it that Twitter twits never cancel, suppress or even fact-check climate fear porn? Why is it never just climate change, but always climate cataclysms? Why always manmade climate change, as though past natural climate changes never happened? Why do Guterres, Gore, Kerry, Biden and AOC always have to top his, her, hir, ver, zir fellow alarmists in hysteria? Why is the fear-mongering always based on computer models, never on actual data and evidence? Why does it always ignore China's massive fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions?)</p><p>One of the prevalent climate alarm themes is sea level rise.</p><p>Back on real Earth, if the DC Swamp inhabitants of 35 million years ago had looked up, they'd have been transfixed in their last moments by a non-special-effects meteor hurtling into what is now Cape Charles, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The 2-mile-wide meteor obliterated and pulverized sediments and bedrock, vaporized plants and animals, sent rock fragments hundreds of miles in every direction, and launched tsunamis into West Virginia's eastern mountain slopes.</p><p>Shattered rock settled back into a crater 4,300 feet deep and 53 miles in diameter. Over the ensuing millennia, river and ocean sediments poured into the crater &amp;ndash; and mile-high glaciers pulled 10-million cubic miles of water out of the oceans, burying half of North America, Europe and Asia under trillions of tons of ice. Land under the ice was pressed down, while land outside the glacial zones was lifted up. Then, some 12,000 years ago, the last Pleistocene glaciers began melting.</p><p>Oceans slowly rose &amp;ndash; some 400 feet! Land masses underwent \"isostatic rebound.\" Areas that had been under the ice began rising; those that had bulged upward began sinking. In much of the Chesapeake Bay region, post-glacial subsidence is compounded by continued compression of pulverized crater rock &amp;ndash; and by the ongoing withdrawal of groundwater from sedimentary aquifers beneath urban and agricultural areas that depend on groundwater.</p><p>The aquifers include layers of porous sandstone (with water between sand grains) interspersed among layers of impermeable but water-soaked shale and clay. As water is pumped out of the sandy layers, the shale-clay layers get squeezed by hundreds of feet of overlying rock and sediment, and their water is forced into the sandstones, and then into pumps. The overlying land steadily subsides.</p><p>In the Chesapeake Bay area, subsidence averages nearly 3 mm/year; 11.5 inches per century. That's in addition to almost 4.5 inches per century in isostatic subsidence, plus 7 to 9 inches per century in actual sea level rise. The total perceived sea level rise can be 24 inches per century &amp;ndash; although two-thirds of that total has nothing to do with actual sea level rise. Indeed, the Norfolk Naval Station tide gauge at Sewell's Point shows that the rate of actual sea level rise has not changed since the gauge was installed in 1927.</p><p>The situation in Houston-Galveston, Texas, Santa Clara Valley, California, and other places around the globe is similarly complicated, even without post-glaciation issues. To single out actual sea level rise &amp;ndash; and blame the rise on humans and fossil fuels &amp;ndash; is simply disingenuous.</p><p>However, salt-water intrusion and coastal flooding are serious, recurrent, growing problems, especially during hurricanes and as more expensive homes are built along coasts. Some communities have slowed subsidence by relocating groundwater pumping stations away from the coast, reducing withdrawal rates, increasing aquifer recharge, or substitut&amp;shy;ing surface water for groundwater. Others have installed sea walls, improved drainage systems, and pipelines to bring water from nearby lakes and rivers. Other options include desalination plants to create more fresh water, recycling household \"gray water\" to agricultural use, and switching to less water-intensive irrigation methods, as Israel does.</p><p>These approaches are far more practical and cost-effective than trying to stop seas from rising any further, like a modern King Canute, by banning fossil fuels, especially if it's done only in some Western nations.</p><p>Meanwhile, inhabitants of Tuvalu, the Maldives and other Pacific islands and coral atolls worry about rising seas due to fossil fuels. However, most of them are increasing in land area, not decreasing &amp;ndash; as corals grow, sediments are laid down off their coasts, and volcanic lava flows expand land masses.</p><p>Moreover, few of these islands and coral reefs even existed 12,000 years ago, when the Wisconsin Glaciation extracted 400 feet of seawater from the world's oceans. The islands and atolls began growing as the seas rose. They've continued growing with every additional foot of sea level rise since the last Ice Age and the Little Ice Age (1350-1850) &amp;ndash; and show no signs of stopping.</p><p>Cosquer Cave's Paleolithic paintings near Marseille, France (the entrance is 115 feet below current sea level) and a Mel Fisher dive team's discovery of charred tree branches and pine cones from a forest fire 8,400 years ago in 40 feet of water off the Florida coast further attest to steadily rising seas.</p><p>Yet, experts tell us. (1) \"Snows are less frequent and less deep. The rivers scarcely ever freeze over now. There is an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold in the spring, which is very fatal to fruits.\" (2) \"We were astonished by the total absence of ice in Barrow Strait. I was here at this time [six years ago] &amp;ndash; still frozen up &amp;ndash; and doubts were entertained as to the possibility of escape.\" (3) \"The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot.\"</p><p>It behooves to take action. Or perhaps not. Quotation (1) is from Thomas Jefferson's diary, 1799; (2) from Sir Francis McClintock's ship's log, 1860; (3) from a Washington Post article, November 2, 1922.</p><p>Instead of parroting scare stories &amp;ndash; and demanding that fossil fuels be replaced by pseudo-clean, pseudo-renewable energy &amp;ndash; it really behooves us to think, analyze, ponder the many ways fossil fuels improve our lives, and demand real evidence instead of GIGO computer models for any supposed climate crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-78211153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:656G-9MH1-JDJN-6165-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 11, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Talk of a U.S. drawdown from Africa, or of U.S. support for French military operations in Africa's Sahel region, must take the evidence of this looming crisis into consideration. It most notably concerns the future security of Senegal, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and BeninCameroon and Nigeria are already affected. Happily, there is reason to believe that the United States has options that might stave off the worst-case scenarios, if policymakers choose them. Early action including security-sector support could be the key. Many programs already exist, though they are threatened by possible cuts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are three things to understand about the crisis in the Sahel. First is that the region's insecurity, though driven by Islamist groups affiliated with international jihadist movements, feeds off of local conflicts and resentments the way a forest fire feeds off of built-up dry vegetation. The Islamists are remarkably adept at exploiting local cleavages.</p><p>Second, the speed with which that fire has spreadfirst in Mali and more recently in Burkina Fasohas exposed just how vulnerable these countries have long been, despite appearances. Analysts including myself got the region wrong, in part because of assumptions about Sahelian politics, religion and society that turned out to be incorrect. Looking at the coastal countries, there is evidence of comparable fragility in some areas. There is no reason to believe with certainty that the intercommunal fighting in central Mali couldn't happen in parts of Ghana, or that terrorists could not perform daily attacks in Dakar. Local conflicts of the type Islamists excel at exploiting abound. Ideas, people, and small arms flow freely across borders that, one must remember, British and French bureaucrats and diplomats set down with no regard for who lived where. These countries also share a problem: Their post-colonial governments have catered to certain elites while doing a terrible job of delivering for the people at the periphery.</p><p>Third: Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, clustered at the bottom of the United Nations' Human Development Index, have extremely limited means to deal effectively with any conflagration, let alone one at the scale we are seeing now in Mali and Burkina Faso. Imagine if Australia had only a few bucket brigades and garden hoses with which to fight its catastrophic bush fires.</p><p>The West Africa region's insecurity feeds off of local conflicts and resentments the way a forest fire feeds off of built-up dry vegetation.</p><p>Share on Twitter</p><p>This third point marks an important difference between Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger on one hand and the coastal states on the other. Many of the coastal countries have far more capable states that provide real governance. Several boast capable and professional militaries, most notably Ghana and Senegal. This means that friends from outside the region have more to work with. They can build on strengths that already exist, and partner institutions have a greater capacity to absorb their aid.</p><p>Skepticism about pouring resources into institutions that simply cannot manage them need not always apply. With relatively small but well-placed investments, the U.S. government could help littoral governments make their populations less vulnerable and their institutions more capable of stemming insecurity and dealing with emerging threats. Economic development always helps, but so would efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and shore up existing justice mechanisms. This would help these countries better address inadequacies, and it would prepare them to counter extremism and terrorism. Police forces are a logical target for assistance. So, of course, are militaries, which even if professional might not be prepared for the kind of fight they could soon face. The United States is already doing many of these things. Extant efforts (PDF) could be stepped up, supplemented or retooled as the nature of the threat becomes clear.</p><p>The key advantage is timing: Too often the United States responds to problems only after they've blossomed into full-blown crises. At that point, often nothing short of a major effort will do. Acting now, before the crisis, Washington could accomplish more, but with a smaller overall investment.</p><p>It should also be noted that in former French colonies there is growing anti-French sentiment on the part of the populations.

State forest rangers note that the improper disposal of wood stove ashes is a frequent cause of wildfires during this season.</p><p>\"Ashes can hold hot embers for several days. If these ashes are thrown into the woods on your property, they can start a brush fire when receptive fuels such as grass and leaf litter dry out,\" said Ben Arnold, principal forest ranger with DEM's Division of Forest Environment. \"Ashes should first be put into a metal ash can, where they can be thoroughly mixed with water before being disposed in an area that is not apt to ignite, such as bare soil.\"</p><p>DEM's Division of Forest Environment has produced helpful safety videos on proper ash disposal and safe open burning. These videos can be found on the Wildland Fire Control Facebook page.</p><p>Residents wishing to burn brush and yard debris outdoors must receive a permit from their local fire district officials. Open burning is banned in some communities and limited in others to specific times and weather conditions.</p><p>DEM forest rangers enforce state laws regulating illegal burning and provide planning and oversight for prescribed burning activities on state properties in cooperation with local fire chiefs and forest management contractors. The State's forest rangers also participate in the Northeast Forest Fire Protection Compact and provide training and support in wildland fire suppression to local fire departments and regional crews.</p><p>For more information on DEM programs and initiatives, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dem.ri.gov\">www.dem.ri.gov</url>.

These conditions will remain in effect until the state sees an adequate level of precipitation. Also, MFS Director Patty Cormier is urging Maine's fire chiefs and town forest fire wardens to use extreme caution or suspend the issuance of written open burning brush permits.</p><p>Campfire permits, required for some remote campsites in unorganized towns, remain available. MFS reminds everyone to obtain landowner permission and seek campfire permits which are available from MFS. Recreational campfires on one's own property for cooking and warming, unless prohibited by local ordinance, do not require an open burning permit and are not subject to this suspension. The suspension of online permits for brush burning will continue until further notice.</p><p>\"While we are temporarily suspending Maine's online burning permit systems, we are also going to rely on the experience of our Forest Rangers and our dedicated partners in the municipal fire service to ensure that Maine is protected from this current wildfire threat,\" commented Cormier.</p><p>Maine Wildfire Update</p><p>Maine is experiencing an abnormally high number of wildfires. To date, Forest Rangers have responded to 712 fires, representing 871 acres. This is the second-highest fire count in 10 years, and it's only June. So far, there has been a 170% increase in wildfires caused by campfires compared to 2019.</p><p>Campfire Safety Tips</p><p>Before considering burning, check <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mainefireweather.org\">www.mainefireweather.org</url> for local fire conditions.</p><p>Keep the fire small, not tall. That way, if you have to leave suddenly, it is easy to extinguish.</p><p>The campfire should be at least 50 feet away from any structures and on level ground.</p><p>Do not use accelerants to start your fire.</p><p>Always have plenty of water on hand and tools available to put out the fire.</p><p>When you are done, check the fire several times to ensure it is out.</p><p>Supervise children and pets near the fire and never leave your fire unattended.</p><p>About MFS</p><p>Since 1891, the mission of MFS is to protect and enhance forest resources through fire prevention, technical assistance, education, outreach to a wide variety of audiences; and enforcement of forest protection laws. MFS offices are found throughout Maine and provide its citizens with a wide range of forest-related services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123777034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606M-Y7G1-DYTH-G013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When theres a hurricane, forest fire or other natural disaster, supplies are going to the specific affected areas. With COVID-19, supplies are coming from and subsequently shippingeverywhere.</p><p>Circle Logistics has shifted their entire transportation network to help manage the 700% increase in volume from customers moving critical medical supplies, like personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators and cots, as well as grocery shipments for major brands.</p><p>Circles partnership with Descartes MacroPoint is providing real-time location, status, and estimated time of arrival of the COVID-19 loads. This visibility enables the agency to closely monitor and evaluate the movement of all of freight via one platform and take corrective action before any potential supply chain disruptions occur. Circles entire workforce has mobilized to help fill the increased shipments for FEMA and other customers during the pandemic.</p><p>Everyone in the Circle Logistics organization is working together, with many pulling after-hour shifts to get orders filled during the crisis, continued Smith. Its the least we can do to help keep hospitals and people supplied with the medical tools and groceries they need.</p><p>Established in Fort Wayne in 2011, Circle Logistics is one of the fastest-growing transportation companies in the country, servicing more than $200 million in freight spend in 2018. Circles large, privately-owned fleet fuels the delivery of a full lineup of trucking services, including dry van, temperature-controlled, flatbed, auto hauling, specialized or oversized, and expedited freight. Circle Logistics was ranked #43 on Transport Topics list of Top Freight Brokerage Firms in 2020.</p><p>For more information on Circle Logistics, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.circledelivers.com\">www.circledelivers.com</url> .</p><p>Will Haraway</p><p>Lead Coverage</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:will@leadcoverage.com\">will@leadcoverage.com</email></p><p>404.593.8320 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PHARMO-172974286</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHARMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRC-7K71-F11P-X460-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428557</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point.

We were among the \"Patriarchs,\" towering, ancient western hemlocks, Douglas firs and western red cedars in an old growth grove in Rainier National Park. Some trees were over a thousand years old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Days later I stood in the Salt Lake Valley surrounded by thousands of residents. Together we breathed in the remains of once vast California forests, inhaling some of the worst air on the planet.</p><p>As the smoky white out conditions totally erased the nearby Oquirrh Mountains, this was only one of several reminders nature has recently given us that radical climate change is underway in Utah. Wilting crops, fallow fields, shrinking rangeland and drying reservoirs are others. Regionally, we need only recall the last week of June when temperatures in the Pacific Northwest were 30 degrees higher than normal and we had an estimated 600 extreme heat related deaths.</p><p>Michael E. Mann, a lead author of the UN's 2001 report by the\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0(IPCC) recently stated that, \"We have zero years left to avoid dangerous climate change, because it's here.\"</p><p>We are now living the new \"normal\" - year-round forest fires, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and climate induced famines; yet still we go on consuming oil and burning coal. So many of us yearn for\u00a0promised change Clean, affordable, renewable energy and better waste processing. They're always on the horizon, just out of reach. What's wrong? For the titans of fossil fuel industries it's business-as-usual when there's money to be made. They call the shots.</p><p>As I looked at the wall of white that had replaced the mountains, my thoughts turned to Chris Hedges, journalist, political commentator and educator. In a recent interview posted on YouTube, Hedges described the United States a one party republic where Democrats and Republicans are simply two wings of the American \"Business Party.\"</p><p>The Business Party is a loose club of elites and their lobbying proxies who have a shared interest in undermining true democracy for personal gain. The pressure of fossil fuel lobbyists and campaign\u00a0dollars cause many lawmakers to be reluctant to pass significant legislation on climate change. Fossil fuel industry leaders also invest large sums of money to buy the voices of talking heads who muddy the findings of climate scientists with misinformation in an attempt to disengage the American public from doing anything meaningful about climate change. It seems that America's elite would have us act out our frustrations politically on each other rather than see us unite to force industries to rapidly shift to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Self-interested, political and business leaders lack the courage and compassion to make the radical changes necessary avert a total climate meltdown. Like gambling addicts who want to maximize their winnings, the elite will not abandon their exploitation of environments and people until the house (the overheating planet) shuts down the game. None of them wants to be the first to walk away from potential profits. For them it will never be over until it's truly over.</p><p>Hedges stated that one of the few things that the business elite fear is massive, widespread, peaceful protest. We can force business leaders and the investment class to help us slow global warming and assist its victims by organizing well orchestrated protests on a national and worldwide scale to promote democratic reforms and introduce aggressive policies to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental destruction.</p><p>Protest can take many forms other than street demonstrations. CNN quotes Maria Lopez-Nu\u00f1ez, deputy director of the Ironbound Community Corporation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that focuses on climate and environmental justice, saying that you want to take meaningful action on the climate crisis, do some homework on the groups active in your area.</p><p>\"Find frontline organizations that are in [your] neighborhood, not just the big organizations,\" Lopez-Nu\u00f1ez said. \"Go find the people that know the issues of your neighborhood, of your cities, of your state.'\"</p><p>The alternative is to go along with the present program of destruction until the world ends in flames. If this sounds too depressingly apocalyptic, step outside and take a breath of smoke from the latest forest fire. We may \"have zero years left to avoid dangerous climate change,\" but we can join others now in saving our planet from the worst of climate change.</p><p>Eric Hubner,\u00a0Volcano, Hawai'i, received both bachelor's and master's degrees from Brigham Young University, as well as a master of social work degree from the State University of New York. He is a retired mental health therapist and school social worker, who also worked in the addiction field and coordinated services for families at risk of child abuse and neglect.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomopinioncommentary20210816erichubnerwehavezero</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CS-WF81-DYT5-M1SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 16, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;
