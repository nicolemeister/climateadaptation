Kristin only appears in a few minutes of the series' first two episodes but plays a crucial role in the story as the season goes on. </p><p>\"It's definitely a slow build,\" Gellar says. \"I liken it to 'The Sixth Sense,' how you have to watch the whole movie, get to the end, and then go back and realize, 'Oh, I didn't see this, this and this.' There's bread crumbs throughout the beginning episodes where you might see less of me, and you have to sort of put it together to really understand why I'm there.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/03/08/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20th-anniversary/98895880/\">Everything \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 has given me in the past 20 years</url></p><p>Gellar, 45, an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" tells us more about the show, \"Buffy\" and the viral resurgence of \"Scooby-Doo.\"  (Edited and condensed for clarity.) </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Question: You've said that initially, you had no intention of saying yes to \"Wolf Pack.\" After \"Buffy,\" were you offered a lot of supernatural films and TV series? </emphasis></p><p>Answer: Absolutely. Supernatural and thriller (projects) still offer the most exciting roles for women: You get to be vulnerable, and you get to fight. But when you have a show like \"Buffy\" it's very hard because inevitably you're going to face comparisons. One of the beauties about \"Buffy\" was that the monsters were metaphors for the horrors of adolescence. And this (show) was really the first time someone came to me again using the monsters as metaphors for what we face now: anxiety, loneliness and the idea of finding your pack.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Did you pay homage to Buffy with Kristin? </emphasis></p><p>Buffy was always known for her boots, and Kristin Ramsey also has a boot situation going on. That's the biggest nod, but they're different boots: Buffy always wore knee-high boots, and Kristen wears more combat (style). </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rodrigo Santoro (\"Westworld\") plays a father who goes missing during the wildfire. As the two adults on set, did you ever flip into \"mom and dad\" mode with your younger co-stars? </emphasis></p><p>Yes, although I don't know if it's so much \"mom and dad\" as mentor. When I was growing up, I didn't have someone on set really looking out. And I said to the kids very early on, \"I'm here. Please come to me and have that open line of communication.\" So it's been great, even from (things like) changing the food on set, which I did. The food was a little rough for actors who are in bikinis throughout the entire season. Not myself \u2013 Rodrigo and I said we knew we made it when we were the only people in the scene not in bikinis. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/01/25/USAT/96b0c4e3-ecf0-42ec-a842-e5061fff7eb5-WOLFPACK_SG_101_0018_RT.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insider.com/sarah-michelle-gellar-male-toxic-set-2022-12\">last month</url> that you worked on \"an extremely toxic male set\" earlier in your career. As an executive producer on \"Wolf Pack,\" were there ways you tried to create a safer, more collaborative environment? </emphasis></p><p>To be clear, I had multiple experiences: some extremely known and some may be less known. It really was very prevalent, and I wasn't just referencing one job \u2013 for goodness sake, I worked with James Toback (a director <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2022/12/james-toback-toback-sued-sexual-misconduct-three-dozen-women-1234788758/\">accused</url> of sexual misconduct since 2017 by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-james-toback-women-sexual-harassment-breaking-silence-20180107-story.html\">hundreds</url> of women).</p><p>But the most important (thing) is to hear how (cast and crew members) are feeling. It doesn't mean you can change everything. Feelings aren't fact, but they have to be understood. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You introduced your kids (ages 13 and 10) to \"Buffy\" during quarantine. Did you make it through all seven seasons? </emphasis></p><p>They watched 1 through 5. We jumped around on 6 and then we got to the second half of 7. My daughter is a true teenager. Buffy and Angel (David Boreanaz) is all she wanted to see. And my son just wanted fight sequences.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/01/25/USAT/b4bcd008-c051-49e0-a4cd-09ddafb36ad7-XXX_E01_V.2_SCOOBY_09_COMING.JPG\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You and your husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., starred in two live-action \"Scooby-Doo\" movies, which are <url normalizedValue=\"https://movieweb.com/scooby-doo-movies-2022-resurgence/\">having a moment</url> online. Have you noticed people are nostalgic for them? </emphasis></p><p>I have, and I needed time. It wasn't the movie that we set out to make. Initially, we were going to make this PG-13, irreverent statement on \"Scooby-Doo\" where Shaggy was the stoner we all knew he was and Fred was sleeping with everyone. Then all of a sudden, it became this very PG movie, (and) it's really hard to start something and see it change into something else. But now with distance, I love it. It makes me laugh and I'm proud of it.</p><p>I always say I'm so lucky because I have multiple characters that people dress up as for Halloween. To me, that's the marker. It's not an award, it's not viewers, it's not magazine covers \u2013 it's that on Halloween, I'll get sent (photos of) multiple people dressing as characters I've played.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/01/25/sarah-michelle-gellar-interview-wolf-pack-buffy-scooby-doo/11097341002/\">How Sarah Michelle Gellar pays homage to 'Buffy' in supernatural drama 'Wolf Pack'</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATOY-11097341002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATOY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67D5-HN71-F03F-K1Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">480731</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Gannett Media Corp  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 25, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>SUB: WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SUB: FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SUB: HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IND: HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SUB: ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IND: STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IND: TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SUB: ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PEO: SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>SUB: FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000022</classCode><className>ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JZH</classCode><className>HIGH SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001704</classCode><className>TELEVISION PROGRAMMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000DDKV</classCode><className>SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The dry-season months of August and September are usually the worst for both deforestation and fire.<br/>It was also the worst August for fire in 12 years. That includes August 2019, when images of the burning rainforest shocked the world and drew criticism from European leaders. Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro had recently taken office and was turning environmental enforcement on its head, saying criminals should not be fined and promising development of the Amazon.<br/>The far-right president downplayed the fires then and continues to do so today. He told media network Globo on Aug. 22 - the worst single day for outbreaks of fire in 15 years - that the criticism is part of an effort to undermine the nation's agribusiness sector.<br/>\"Brazil does not deserve to be attacked in this way,\" said Bolsonaro, who is campaigning for reelection.<br/>The fires are evident even several hundred miles away in the Amazon's largest city, Manaus, where smoke has hung in the sky for weeks.<br/>Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, primarily to improve cattle pasture or burn recently felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and spread into pristine areas of the forest.<br/>After a calm period with unusually high rainfall in early August, blazes began spreading rapidly, said Ane Alencar, coordinator of the Mapbiomas Fire project, run by a network of nonprofits, universities and tech startups.<br/>\"The deforestation rate is very high. That means there are many fallen trees ready to burn,\" Alencar told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview. \"The fire season will be even more intense in September.\"<br/>About 20 percent of the area burned in the Amazon this year was deforested recently. Some is within protected areas that are targeted by land-grabbers, according to an analysis by the Center of Life Institute, a Brazilian nonprofit, based on NASA's Global Fire Emissions Database.<br/>One example is Cristalino II State Park in Mato Grosso, an area whose protection recently was declared illegal by a state court. The state prosecutor's office appealed that decision, but the legal dissolution seemed to give license to deforesters, unleashing a wave of destruction. In just the past few weeks, fire has destroyed nearly 15 square miles in the park, despite the presence of firefighters, according to the Center of Life Institute.<br/>Widespread fire means Brazil is failing to curb greenhouse gas emissions, as almost half the country's carbon pollution comes from land conversion. The Amazon rainforest is an important carbon absorber for the planet, but burning timber releases that carbon into the atmosphere.<br/>During the COP26 climate summit earlier this year, the Bolsonaro government promised to stop all illegal deforestation by 2028. So far during his tenure, forest loss has surged to a 15-year high.<br/>\"If Brazil wants to reduce its carbon emissions, the No. 1 thing to do is reduce deforestation. And the second is to reduce the use of fire,\" Alencar said.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8107743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:669N-3KB1-JBSN-0374-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Columbian Publishing Co.

These characteristics have not been extensively analyzed in lower subtropical China and therefore, three typical subtropical evergreen forest ecosystems, Pinus massoniana coniferous forest (PF), mixed conifer-broadleaf forest (CBF), and monsoon evergreen broadleaved forest (MBF), were chosen to explore the changes of the litter moisture content and its response to environmental factors. New hydrological insights for the region: Over a 7-year observation period, the mean annual litter moisture content was 72.0 \u00b1 7.3%, 87.9 \u00b1 11.3%, and 100.5 \u00b1 15.7% for PF, CBF, and MBF respectively. The litter moisture content increased while the litter standing mass decreased after vegetation restoration. The litter moisture content in the three forests during the wet season was substantially higher than that in the dry season. Compared to the soil layer, the coefficient of variation of the litter moisture content during the dry and wet seasons was higher as compared to the topsoil (0-30 cm) water content, indicating the litter layer was more sensitive to changes in external environmental factors.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Further analysis revealed that soil water content was the dominating factor controlling the dynamics of litter moisture content both during the dry and wet seasons. Analyses of the litter moisture can be very useful in forests around the world as a guideline in indicating the change in a forest's environment.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Soil moisture dominated the temporal dynamics of litter moisture content in subtropical forests: a 7-year observation in south China. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies</emphasis>, 2022,41():101102.

Note: In this article, the terms \"wildland structure interface\" and \"interface\" indicate a condition where a fire in wildland fuels (i.e., grasses, brush, trees) affects structures, which affects communities, firefighters and fire departments. Fire behavior, fuel and weather conditions It is imperative for members to understand the local conditions that influence the behavior of a fire-in particular, fuel type and quantity, wind, aspect and slope, and the potential speed of growth (rate of spread) of the fire. Members should study their local weather history, particularly wind speed, direction, and duration during the passage of cold fronts and other significant weather events. </p><p>The effect of wind speed and direction of the spread of fires in the interface also is important to continuously observe and evaluate. In the Northern Rockies, wind is a direct driver of fire behavior. Simply, the faster the wind speed, the faster that the fire moves and the more widespread the effect. In receptive fuels, wind speeds of faster than 10mph drive fire in grass more quickly than firefighters who are on foot can suppress the fire. (Receptive fuels are grasses, brush and timber that are dry enough to burn: Hot, dry conditions result in hot, dry fuel. These fuels are referred to as receptive because when they are exposed to any form of ignition-lightning, sparks from human activity, flying, burning embers from an approaching fire front, etc.-they ignite readily. In comparison, fuels that are soaking wet are difficult to ignite, hence not receptive to ignition sources.) In forested areas, winds that are faster than 20mph can result in torching and intermittent crown fires. This development can produce an increase of embers that are cast to a distance of one-quarter mile to 1.5 miles ahead of the flaming front of the fire. The results of some research indicate that they are the cause of 90 percent of ignitions of structures that are affected by wildland fire. At a basic level, slope has a similar effect on fire spread as wind speed has. The steeper the slope, the more quickly that the fire moves. Aspect is the direction that the slope faces. It directly affects the preheat of fuels. The more that aspect is south and west, the more that the sun's radiant energy preheats the fuel during the hottest part of the day. The greater the fuel preheat, the more quickly fire spreads.</p><h>Detailed mapping and address posting</h><p>Accurate recording of road names and addresses of structures on paper maps helps responders to navigate in a timely manner and provide room for notes about what responders will find, such as residents who are staying to defend their property and hazards that affect response.</p><p>An excellent example of mapping and pre-planning for fires in the interface is the Wildland Fire Urban Interface Plan that's used by the Hyalite Fire Department in Gallatin County, MT (hyalitefire.org/resources).</p><h>Deployment of firefighters</h><p>Fighting fire in the interface is a blend of both wildland and structure firefighting strategy and tactics. In all cases, it's essential that firefighters who are at the task, tactical and strategic levels ensure that lookouts, communications, escape routes and safety zones (LCES) are in place and are utilized by every member who is deployed to the direct firefight.</p><p>Fires in the interface can benefit from firefighting actions that utilize a combination of wildland and structure firefighting equipment and skills. This level of skills and equipment allows firefighters the maximum amount of versatility in fighting fires.</p><p>Because some structures are arranged to have LCES in place, firefighters who are in the interface should have structure and wildland PPE, including SCBA, and apparatus that have fire-rated pumps and a standard complement of firefighting equipment. Engines that have a minimum of a 150-gpm fire-rated pump, a water tank that's sized at a minimum of 500 gallons and four-wheel drive are effective in the interface.</p><h>How much help how quickly?</h><p>Mutual aid is vital, and it must be supported with command staff to manage the arriving help. Just as important is pre-incident planning, including prepackaged resource orders (standard greater alarms, command staff, strike teams, task forces, etc.).</p><p>Mapping and logistics must be in place to support continuous operation throughout the period of weather that favors fire spread as well as for several days afterward, to \"patrol\" communities to ensure that latent ignition is caught early.</p><p>The fire service in Montana has a strong mutual aid communications plan, and most of the fire agencies that are in the state have those channels in their radios. Many fire departments regularly practice command procedures using those radio channels.</p><p>Lots of response help can result in significant costs to a jurisdiction. Be ready with preapproval to authorize expenditures for resources (for example, mutual aid, helicopters, etc.) that exceed daily operations. Build understanding and support with the members of the governing bodies that set revenue and with finance staff that supports your organization.</p><h>Survivable structures</h><p>Fire protection for private property is overwhelmingly the responsibility of local government, although several states provide options for enhanced protection in response to wildland fires-in Montana, forest fire protection districts overlay private property.</p><p>Federal wildland firefighting agencies have no responsibility to protect structures that are located on private property.</p><p>Some state wildland firefighting agencies take a full-suppression approach to wildland fires and are strong, integrated mutual aid partners when it comes to the support of local fire departments regarding the protection of their community.</p><p>Local cooperators (of all kinds) are critical to successfully fighting fires in the interface.</p><p>Property owners who educate themselves, understand fire-resistive property maintenance and take action to make their property more resistive to the spread of fire likely will have better outcomes in the event that their property is affected by fire in the interface.</p><p>Individual responsibility of property owners/occupants includes the area from the home out to as far as several hundred feet, based on fuel load, slope, aspect and prevailing wind. Circumstances in which there has been a reduction of fuels that are around structures beginning at the structure and working outward are more likely to be resistive to fire spread than circumstances where a home has fuel closer to it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FIREHS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FIREHS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6893-0601-DYPC-32HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293676</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Endeavor Business Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FIREHOUSE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29128\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 48</volume><issueNumber>No. 3</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3D7</classCode><className>ROCKY MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Halawi talks to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> about his new role, and why he sees it as the most interesting and fascinating challenge of his career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: This seems a big change from your roles at Thuraya and Intelsat. Could you tell us why you decided to take this job?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>This role is about building a completely new industry. I consider this a new frontier. It is an industry and a company that will do a lot in terms of saving and improving people's lives. At the same time, it is done in a green way and in an environmentally friendly way. So, I think this capability from the stratosphere is really fascinating, I call it a new frontier for telecoms. It has new characteristics that combine the best of satellite and terrestrial, but without the limitations of either. There was something from space that wasn't quite right and this also applies to ground infrastructure, when serving some use cases especially in rural and remote areas. This gives us the best of both worlds. That was really interesting to me, even when I was still at Intelsat. This technology came to my radar screen, and I got really interested in it. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Do you think HAPs works naturally into an operator's multi-orbit strategy, since this seems to be the trend in their future business models?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>A few years ago, all satellite operators started to talk about having multi-orbit strategies. And different orbits give you different characteristics. This particular orbit is really interesting in terms of the capabilities it can do in terms of talking directly to end user devices. That is a game changing capability in my mind, that and being able to communicate with very low latency. Satellite operators tend to downplay the importance of low latency, but in an age of video conferencing and cloud based services, low latency is important. This capability from the stratosphere, and this project we are doing, has the capability to grow into a very massive business. If you look at the aircraft Airbus has built, it is an incredible platform. It allows us to cater to use cases that are very difficult to cater to from a satellite point of view or from a terrestrial point of view. Things like mobile connectivity that is direct to end users in rural and remote areas. Border protection, forest fire management, precision agriculture, coverage augmentation, disaster relief. But, in addition to all of this, there is an ability to unlock markets that are coming up in the future. So, things like \"~connected cars' and connecting eVTOLs and things that move that you can't connect efficiently from satellite systems or from terrestrial infrastructure. The idea of HAPs has been around since 1945, but the technology wasn't there to make it happen, now the technology is. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: How are you looking to build this business over the next couple of years?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are moving away from the incubator phase under Airbus to become a significant business on its own. Now, we have a proven aircraft that is near final design stage. It is the only one that has flown overnight in the stratosphere and has done so for 64 days straight. My objective over the next two years is to industrialize the aircraft. We need to industrialize it and roll out operations. We will build a handful of hubs around the world, from where we launch and land the aircraft. We will roll these out in the next two years, that is one of our key priorities. Building the telecoms business around the aircraft is important as well. The aircraft is like the bus for a satellite, and then you have the payload and everything that goes with it. So, rolling out the telecoms business and deploying the limited supply we have to our first customers will be a key objective for the next two years. We aim to enter into service at the end of 2024. We also need to recruit highly skilled talent, because we need people that are driven by this desire to do good for humanity, but at the same time, do good for the planet. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Finding a HAPs business model that works has proved far from easy for many trying to enter this space. Why do you think Aalto HAPS can succeed where others have failed?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>What you need is the technology and the business model, and both need to align. Technologically, with HAPs, we can go directly to the device, but not just in emergency mode, SMS mode, or short data mode. We can go in full 5G with very low latency. It is very similar to a terrestrial tower. Each of these elements on its own very important. You don't need a dish. You don't need a tower on the ground. You can cater to all of the services like cloud and teleconferencing, and very importantly, the technology seamlessly integrates with the telecoms operators' networks. It is not a separate service to the consumer. It is an infrastructure play to the MNO, the customer. They use it to expand their coverage. Commercially, the total cost of ownership is appealing and unbeatable by either satellite or terrestrial. I am talking about the focus on rural and remote areas, not urban areas. It is scalable, it allows the MNOs to expand the coverage of the network in a profitable way. At the moment, they don't invest to expand the network beyond a certain point, because they can't justify the costs of expanding terrestrial infrastructure. What we do is we allow them to cover those areas, not only in a way that is cheaper than terrestrial towers but do it in a way that is profitable to them. There are other examples. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/innovation/2021/01/22/alphabet-shutters-loon-venture/\">Google Loon started a project</url> and they got good traction from the market very quickly, but what happened is because they needed a lot more balloons to cover a certain area and you can't control the balloons precisely in where they go. So, what ended up happening is you had a technology that worked, but the cost of that technology was high because you had to use so many balloons. In our case, the technology and the use case align perfectly. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Are you still on track to launch commercial services by the end of 2024? What will this look like? </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are looking to launch commercial services by the end of next year. We will start small. We will build a number of aircraft, then expand as we go. Having said that, we are a revenue generating business. We are generating revenues from proofs of concepts. A lot of customers are so interested in these capabilities that we have, and being a dual use technology, we have customers that are testing our aircraft and payloads. By the end of next year, we will start ramping up in terms of customers. We are talking to a few today, and have them lined up to be the first customers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: When will Aalto HAPS become profitable?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are a private company, so we won't share financials. We are focused on launching commercial services by the end of next year. We need to build the business and serving customers. We are benefitting from the fact we are generating revenues. We are not just burning cash to develop the business. We are generating revenues today. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Are the telcos the main customers for Aalto HAPS? How soon will you have commercial partnerships with them?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>The technology is really fascinating with HAPs, because you attach different payloads, and it can look very different for different types of customers. Our core business will be mobile connectivity where we have a 5G antenna that will serve mobile operators. We see mobile operators being our core customer group, and the tower companies as well. What we give them (tower companies) is an extension of their product portfolio. Now, they can have sky-based towers for the MNOs. So, they can serve their MNO customers a bit differently. But, there are also things like Earth observation (EO). These services could be used by civil and government customers, to do things like forest fire management, water protection, precision agriculture. This is a whole set of potential customers we could have. In addition to this, HAPs can act like a GEO satellite, with a much lower altitude. It operates in Q- and V-band, it has ample bandwidth, and can do things that are really interesting for service providers that want to bring in HAPs as part of their multi-orbit strategy. So, you can offer services to cruise ships, regular ships, planes, trains, anything that moves on the ground, we can serve with capacity, but not just with capacity, but with capacity that moves with it. Imagine a cruise ship moving around with a plane overhead and it is serving it as well. We could have the cruise operators as customers or the service providers serving them. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: You mentioned cruise lines. SES has performed strongly here, and now Starlink is starting to gain traction. Do you think it is feasible that Aalto HAPS can make an impact here?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>What we have is that is really interesting is that we have the capability to follow a cruise ship and deliver the capacity overhead, whereas with satellite, they are providing coverage, and depending on where the cruise ship is, the bandwidth availability is different. So, we can do that, not in our first version. Our first version, but in our next version, which will have two payloads, one could serve the cruise ship, while the other acts as a backhaul. As we develop the platform a bit better, we can provide ample bandwidth to cruise ships exactly where they need it, and it is symmetrical. They don't have to worry about different ratios. Cruise ships now want more and more symmetrical capability because there is a lot more upload compared to download. So, I think we have a very interesting value proposition for the cruise market over the next few years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Could you tell us about your plans to develop a number of ports over the next few years? When is the first one likely to be in operation?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We will fly from a handful of locations around the world. The reason for this is we want to have complementarity in weather patterns because we want access to the stratosphere all year long. The plane is a small plane and weighs only 75 kilograms. It has the wingspan of an Airbus 320. What you don't want to do is fly it through storms and bad weather to get it up to the stratosphere. So, we are looking for a handful of locations around the world that in totality will give us access to the stratosphere all year long. Today, we are finalizing our preferred locations in countries, both where the weather is good, and where it is advantageous to establish a hub. Those countries could be sharing and supporting our vision, helping us with this quest, and providing subsidies. We are looking at four to five hubs around the world, and we are just finalizing where they will be. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: What are the benefits of having Airbus as a major shareholder for such an operation/business plan? You also are an independent business? Why do you think the structure of the business will help you be successful?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>Having Airbus is an incredibly amazing competitive advantage. This whole business is based on an aircraft and Airbus is the best aircraft designer and builder in the world. It has done a great job building this plane. It is not the work of a couple of years. This has been in development for 18 years. Airbus has put a lot into it. They are committed to this project and to providing support on the engineering side, and in other ways as well. It is incredibly important to have a company like Airbus behind it. Why is it an independent business? We are turning an aircraft into a full service business. Because of that, bringing in the right partners that will add value to this project is something that is key, to make it more successful. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: How would you compare the challenge of this role compared to other roles you have had?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>This is the most interesting and fascinating challenge of my career. Firstly, we are setting up a whole new industry, rather than joining an industry that has existed for awhile. It is an industry based on incredibly new and fascinating technology. Secondly, it touches on so many elements that are important in the world, and increasingly important in the world, those are direct-to-device, 5G, sustainability, autonomous flight operations, solar power, battery technologies, etc. All of these are trending upwards and these are core to our project. I would say this is a project where we can do good for humanity, while being great for the planet. It has either been one or the other before for me. This one is both. It is quite rewarding from that point of view. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SATTDY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SATTDY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67RN-BR31-DYTC-00GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Access Intelligence, LLC.

Various firefighting assets have been already deployed or are on their way to help the local responders. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism is providing Slovenia with 3 firefighting helicopters, (one from Austria, one from Croatia, and one from Slovakia), and a Croatian forest fire fighting team, consisting of 4 trucks and 9 firefighters. Moreover, an amphibious firefighting plane from the rescEU reserve stationed in Croatia has been deployed since yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, said: \"This is, no doubt, one of the biggest wildfires in the history of Slovenia. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Croatia, Austria, and Slovakia. Their help via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Slovenia, my home country, is deeply appreciated. This is EU solidarity at its best. At the same time and in view of ever more devastating impacts of climate change, which we are currently witnessing across Europe, I reiterate the need for immediate action at every level across the sectors in every Member State, with support of the EU, as to strengthen our response capacities but foremost preparedness to prevent the worst.\"</p><p>In addition, the EU's emergency Copernicus satellite is helping to provide damage assessment maps of the affected areas in Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.</p><p>Because of the persistent heat wave, the risk of forest fires remains very high for wide areas of western Europe. In July, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) has been activated for forest fires by four countries - Portugal (9 - 18 July), Albania (13 - 18 July), France (ongoing), and Slovenia (ongoing). In response, 4 planes from the rescEU reserve in Italy and Spain were deployed in Portugal, and 2 planes from the rescEU reserve in Greece operated in France, and 2 planes from the European Civil Protection Pool were deployed in Albania.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>The EU Civil Protection Mechanism strengthens cooperation between and among Member States and Participating States in the field of civil protection, with a view to improving prevention, preparedness, and response to disasters. Through the Mechanism, the European Commission plays a key role in coordinating the response to disasters in Europe and beyond.</p><p>When the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, it can request assistance via the Mechanism. Once activated, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre coordinates assistance made available by its Participating States through spontaneous offers. Should the emergency require additional assistance, the rescEU reserve can be activated.</p><p>To date, all EU Member States participate in the Mechanism, as well as Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Turkey. Since its inception in 2001, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has responded to over 600 requests for assistance inside and outside the EU.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For More Information</p><p>EU Civil Protection Mechanism (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/mechanism_en</url>)</p><p>rescEU (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/resceu_en</url>)</p><p>Emergency Response Coordination Centre (<url normalizedValue=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en\">https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en</url>)</p><p>Forest fires (<url normalizedValue=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/forest-fires_en\">https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/civil-protection/forest-fires_en</url>)</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_4642\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_4642</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7899707 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7899707</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:660F-YX41-JC11-12SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 23, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Multirotors play an important role in electric power inspection, border control, modern agriculture, forest fire fighting, flood control, disaster prevention, etc.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Beijing Natural Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Scholars of Beijing Technology And Business University.<br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Technology and Business University: \"Multirotor failures, such as a communication fault, a sensor failure, or a power system anomaly, may well lead to mission interruption, multirotor crashes, and even casualties. To ensure flight safety, a multirotor decision module should be established to prevent or reduce the adverse effects caused by failure. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time safety decision-making method for multirotor flight strategies based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Firstly, the flight of the multirotor was simulated based on the Rflysim UAV flight simulation platform, and a fault-injection module was constructed to simulate different types of faults, so as to realize real-time monitoring of the flight status of the multirotor, and to collect flight data under various faults to establish condition assessment information sources. Then, based on the random forest algorithm, a failure level classification model of the multirotor was constructed, the model was trained and verified by inputting flight data of three types of safety level failures, and the model effectively classified the failure levels of the multirotor. Under this framework, a real-time safety decision-making model for the multirotor based on the TOPSIS model was constructed to realize the flight safety decision-making of the multirotor under different faults.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This method can effectively realize the real-time decision-making for the flight strategy of a multirotor. By comparison with other models, the classification accuracy of the failure level classification model is higher, and the consideration of flight decision-making is more comprehensive and accurate, thus effectively ensuring the flight safety of the multirotor.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Real-Time Safety Decision-Making Method for Multirotor Flight Strategies Based on TOPSIS Model. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Applied Sciences</emphasis>, 2022,12(6696):6696.

(Chaucer defined large wildfires as more than 30 hectares).</p><p>While much attention has been paid to the impact of climate change on wildfires in North America, Chaucer warns that European wildfires also have been increasing in frequency and severity as a result of climate change and urbanization. Higher temperatures have increased the risk of fires starting on the continent, while drought-like conditions from dry soil are also making it easier for wildfires to spread rapidly, the insurer continued.</p><p>The abandonment of traditional agriculture in Mediterranean countries has contributed to a build-up of vegetation, resulting in increased size and severity of fires. Further, Europe is a densely populated continent, which increases the potential for material losses to property.</p><p>Chaucer said forest management practices have not kept up with these trends, which has made efforts to suppress wildfires considerably less effective, leading to more damage.</p><p>Less Advanced Models </p><p>Chaucer says modeling capabilities of wildfire risk in Southern Europe are less advanced when compared to the U.S. and Canada. As a result, re/insurance companies must rely on internal methods to assess risk rather than probabilistic hazard models.</p><p>However, the industry has started to see some broker-led initiatives and solutions, Chaucer noted.</p><p>As wildfires have only recently been considered a material peril, the modeling used to predict behavior is not as developed as that of other natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, the company explained.</p><p>The high number of variables that influence wildfire behavior, such as weather patterns, fuel, property characteristics, topography (orientation towards the sun and land gradient, for example), also make patterns difficult to predict.</p><p>The countries that saw the largest increases in amount of land burnt in the past year include Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (246%); Croatia (130%); Italy (36%) and Greece (34%). A single fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina resulted in over 8,000 hectares being burnt.</p><p>\"The significant increase in land destroyed by wildfires is creating a challenge for the industry,\" commented Ellen Gyandzhuntseva, head of Exposure Management at Chaucer.</p><p>\"Climate change and shifting demographic patterns are making wildfires more dangerous. Until modelling becomes more sophisticated, and the risk is better understood, wildfire risk in Europe will be difficult to adequately price,\" she added.</p><p>\"Wildfires have only become a major priority as a peril relatively recently. However, given the increase in frequency and severity, losses are beginning to mount. We have already seen some re/insurers begin to limit their exposure as a result,\" Gyandzhuntseva said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: Chaucer</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Photograph: Firefighters try to extinguish the flames at Ellinika village on Evia island, about 176 kilometers (110 miles) north of Athens, Greece, on Monday, Aug. 9, 2021.

He is held many big roles from the CEO of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Thuraya</emphasis>, to the CCO of both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intelsat</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">OneWeb</emphasis>. Halawi left Intelsat last year, and has now become the CEO of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AaltonHAPS</emphasis>, an exciting new start-up. It is an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Airbus</emphasis> subsidiary that provides services from its stratospheric Zephyr solar-powered aircraft for mobile connectivity, platform mobility, Earth observation (EO) and government applications. Halawi is excited about the new role, and talks of building a new industry. Halawi talks to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> about his new role, and why he sees it as the most interesting and fascinating challenge of his career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: This seems a big change from your roles at Thuraya and Intelsat. Could you tell us why you decided to take this job?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>This role is about building a completely new industry. I consider this a new frontier. It is an industry and a company that will do a lot in terms of saving and improving people's lives. At the same time, it is done in a green way and in an environmentally friendly way. So, I think this capability from the stratosphere is really fascinating, I call it a new frontier for telecoms. It has new characteristics that combine the best of satellite and terrestrial, but without the limitations of either. There was something from space that wasn't quite right and this also applies to ground infrastructure, when serving some use cases especially in rural and remote areas. This gives us the best of both worlds. That was really interesting to me, even when I was still at Intelsat. This technology came to my radar screen, and I got really interested in it. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Do you think HAPs works naturally into an operator's multi-orbit strategy, since this seems to be the trend in their future business models?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>A few years ago, all satellite operators started to talk about having multi-orbit strategies. And different orbits give you different characteristics. This particular orbit is really interesting in terms of the capabilities it can do in terms of talking directly to end user devices. That is a game changing capability in my mind, that and being able to communicate with very low latency. Satellite operators tend to downplay the importance of low latency, but in an age of video conferencing and cloud based services, low latency is important. This capability from the stratosphere, and this project we are doing, has the capability to grow into a very massive business. If you look at the aircraft Airbus has built, it is an incredible platform. It allows us to cater to use cases that are very difficult to cater to from a satellite point of view or from a terrestrial point of view. Things like mobile connectivity that is direct to end users in rural and remote areas. Border protection, forest fire management, precision agriculture, coverage augmentation, disaster relief. But, in addition to all of this, there is an ability to unlock markets that are coming up in the future. So, things like \"~connected cars' and connecting eVTOLs and things that move that you can't connect efficiently from satellite systems or from terrestrial infrastructure. The idea of HAPs has been around since 1945, but the technology wasn't there to make it happen, now the technology is. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: How are you looking to build this business over the next couple of years?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are moving away from the incubator phase under Airbus to become a significant business on its own. Now, we have a proven aircraft that is near final design stage. It is the only one that has flown overnight in the stratosphere and has done so for 64 days straight. My objective over the next two years is to industrialize the aircraft. We need to industrialize it and roll out operations. We will build a handful of hubs around the world, from where we launch and land the aircraft. We will roll these out in the next two years, that is one of our key priorities. Building the telecoms business around the aircraft is important as well. The aircraft is like the bus for a satellite, and then you have the payload and everything that goes with it. So, rolling out the telecoms business and deploying the limited supply we have to our first customers will be a key objective for the next two years. We aim to enter into service at the end of 2024. We also need to recruit highly skilled talent, because we need people that are driven by this desire to do good for humanity, but at the same time, do good for the planet. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Finding a HAPs business model that works has proved far from easy for many trying to enter this space. Why do you think Aalto HAPS can succeed where others have failed?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>What you need is the technology and the business model, and both need to align. Technologically, with HAPs, we can go directly to the device, but not just in emergency mode, SMS mode, or short data mode. We can go in full 5G with very low latency. It is very similar to a terrestrial tower. Each of these elements on its own very important. You don't need a dish. You don't need a tower on the ground. You can cater to all of the services like cloud and teleconferencing, and very importantly, the technology seamlessly integrates with the telecoms operators' networks. It is not a separate service to the consumer. It is an infrastructure play to the MNO, the customer. They use it to expand their coverage. Commercially, the total cost of ownership is appealing and unbeatable by either satellite or terrestrial. I am talking about the focus on rural and remote areas, not urban areas. It is scalable, it allows the MNOs to expand the coverage of the network in a profitable way. At the moment, they don't invest to expand the network beyond a certain point, because they can't justify the costs of expanding terrestrial infrastructure. What we do is we allow them to cover those areas, not only in a way that is cheaper than terrestrial towers but do it in a way that is profitable to them. There are other examples. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/innovation/2021/01/22/alphabet-shutters-loon-venture/\">Google Loon started a project</url> and they got good traction from the market very quickly, but what happened is because they needed a lot more balloons to cover a certain area and you can't control the balloons precisely in where they go. So, what ended up happening is you had a technology that worked, but the cost of that technology was high because you had to use so many balloons. In our case, the technology and the use case align perfectly. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Are you still on track to launch commercial services by the end of 2024? What will this look like? </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are looking to launch commercial services by the end of next year. We will start small. We will build a number of aircraft, then expand as we go. Having said that, we are a revenue generating business. We are generating revenues from proofs of concepts. A lot of customers are so interested in these capabilities that we have, and being a dual use technology, we have customers that are testing our aircraft and payloads. By the end of next year, we will start ramping up in terms of customers. We are talking to a few today, and have them lined up to be the first customers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: When will Aalto HAPS become profitable?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We are a private company, so we won't share financials. We are focused on launching commercial services by the end of next year. We need to build the business and serving customers. We are benefitting from the fact we are generating revenues. We are not just burning cash to develop the business. We are generating revenues today. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Are the telcos the main customers for Aalto HAPS? How soon will you have commercial partnerships with them?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>The technology is really fascinating with HAPs, because you attach different payloads, and it can look very different for different types of customers. Our core business will be mobile connectivity where we have a 5G antenna that will serve mobile operators. We see mobile operators being our core customer group, and the tower companies as well. What we give them (tower companies) is an extension of their product portfolio. Now, they can have sky-based towers for the MNOs. So, they can serve their MNO customers a bit differently. But, there are also things like Earth observation (EO). These services could be used by civil and government customers, to do things like forest fire management, water protection, precision agriculture. This is a whole set of potential customers we could have. In addition to this, HAPs can act like a GEO satellite, with a much lower altitude. It operates in Q- and V-band, it has ample bandwidth, and can do things that are really interesting for service providers that want to bring in HAPs as part of their multi-orbit strategy. So, you can offer services to cruise ships, regular ships, planes, trains, anything that moves on the ground, we can serve with capacity, but not just with capacity, but with capacity that moves with it. Imagine a cruise ship moving around with a plane overhead and it is serving it as well. We could have the cruise operators as customers or the service providers serving them. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: You mentioned cruise lines. SES has performed strongly here, and now Starlink is starting to gain traction. Do you think it is feasible that Aalto HAPS can make an impact here?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>What we have is that is really interesting is that we have the capability to follow a cruise ship and deliver the capacity overhead, whereas with satellite, they are providing coverage, and depending on where the cruise ship is, the bandwidth availability is different. So, we can do that, not in our first version. Our first version, but in our next version, which will have two payloads, one could serve the cruise ship, while the other acts as a backhaul. As we develop the platform a bit better, we can provide ample bandwidth to cruise ships exactly where they need it, and it is symmetrical. They don't have to worry about different ratios. Cruise ships now want more and more symmetrical capability because there is a lot more upload compared to download. So, I think we have a very interesting value proposition for the cruise market over the next few years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: Could you tell us about your plans to develop a number of ports over the next few years? When is the first one likely to be in operation?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>We will fly from a handful of locations around the world. The reason for this is we want to have complementarity in weather patterns because we want access to the stratosphere all year long. The plane is a small plane and weighs only 75 kilograms. It has the wingspan of an Airbus 320. What you don't want to do is fly it through storms and bad weather to get it up to the stratosphere. So, we are looking for a handful of locations around the world that in totality will give us access to the stratosphere all year long. Today, we are finalizing our preferred locations in countries, both where the weather is good, and where it is advantageous to establish a hub. Those countries could be sharing and supporting our vision, helping us with this quest, and providing subsidies. We are looking at four to five hubs around the world, and we are just finalizing where they will be. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: What are the benefits of having Airbus as a major shareholder for such an operation/business plan? You also are an independent business? Why do you think the structure of the business will help you be successful?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>Having Airbus is an incredibly amazing competitive advantage. This whole business is based on an aircraft and Airbus is the best aircraft designer and builder in the world. It has done a great job building this plane. It is not the work of a couple of years. This has been in development for 18 years. Airbus has put a lot into it. They are committed to this project and to providing support on the engineering side, and in other ways as well. It is incredibly important to have a company like Airbus behind it. Why is it an independent business? We are turning an aircraft into a full service business. Because of that, bringing in the right partners that will add value to this project is something that is key, to make it more successful. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">VIA SATELLITE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">: How would you compare the challenge of this role compared to other roles you have had?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Halawi: </emphasis>This is the most interesting and fascinating challenge of my career. Firstly, we are setting up a whole new industry, rather than joining an industry that has existed for awhile. It is an industry based on incredibly new and fascinating technology. Secondly, it touches on so many elements that are important in the world, and increasingly important in the world, those are direct-to-device, 5G, sustainability, autonomous flight operations, solar power, battery technologies, etc. All of these are trending upwards and these are core to our project. I would say this is a project where we can do good for humanity, while being great for the planet. It has either been one or the other before for me. This one is both. It is quite rewarding from that point of view. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00c2\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SATTDY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SATTDY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67R7-5F71-DYTC-04FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Access Intelligence, LLC.

A few points on all this:</p><p>** First, weren't we told this would be \"transitory\"?</p><p>Remember how the Biden Administration and highbrow academics assured us that this inflation was temporary? Anyone still standing by those predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. Even CNN conceded earlier this morning that \"There's no end in sight for higher prices.\"</p><p>** Second, this inflation is hurting the lower- and middle-income Americans the most!!</p><p>Inflation is a regressive tax, of sorts.

Fires in the country emitted 344,000 tonnes of carbon in June-July this year, the highest since June-July of 2003. Other countries such as Portugal have seen lower forest fire emissions than in some recent years. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The Science for Nature and People Partnership led the organization of these discussions.</p><p>On May 2, more than two dozen of those participants published a paper in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports that is part review of current scientific understanding of the issues and health impacts and part consensus report on how to deal with them.</p><p>\"It started as a conversation between experts who think about fire from really different angles in order to find how we can address fire through an interdisciplinary lens,\" said lead author Savannah D'Evelyn, a postdoctoral fellow in UW's Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences. \"It took a little bit to get to the fact that it was really smoke that brought us all together. We kind of had to set a baseline for what peoples' starting points were all smoke is bad smoke from a public health perspective, but we can't do fire management without more fire.\"</p><p>That working group comprised of scientists, practitioners and managers who specialize in areas of forest and fire ecology, fire safety, air quality, health care and public health agreed on six statements and recommendations as part of its \"interdisciplinary approach\" to the issues.</p><p>\"The Nature Conservancy is dedicated to an evidence-based approach to forest and fire management practices that supports the health of both nature and people. These consensus statements aim to serve as guideposts for forest health and public health professionals to work together to promote healthy and resilient forests and communities,\" said Ryan Haugo, co-author and director of conservation science for The Nature Conservancy in Oregon.</p><p>The first consensus statement addresses the issue of the long-running effort to suppress all forest fires versus the historic practices of Indigenous peoples:</p><p>\"We recognize the need to listen to and integrate a diversity of perspectives, in particular those embodied by Indigenous peoples who have successfully used fire as an ecological tool for thousands of years,\" the authors wrote.</p><p>\"I've often heard from Tribal leaders how controlled burns were one of many tools they employed historically to steward healthy ecosystems,\" said Gillian Mittelstaedt, co-author and executive director of the Tribal Healthy Homes Network. \"This Tribal knowledge has been overlooked, perilously, during decades of European colonization, and federal land management practices. It is only in recent years, as forest ecosystems decline in health, that Western science has begun to recognize and learn from the innate sensibility and sustainability of traditional Tribal burning practices.\"</p><p>Here are the other five consensus statements:</p><p>Prescribed fires in addition to managed fires for resource benefit are both necessary management techniques to keep forests resilient and to lessen the negative ecological and public health impacts of wildfires.</p><p>Certain regions of the Western U.S. will experience more smoke days with heightened use of prescribed and managed fire; however, we expect the impacts of smoke exposure to be reduced over the long term in comparison with untreated land burned by wildfires. With these techniques, exposure in affected communities can be planned and lessened.</p><p>No degree of smoke exposure is without risk. However, additional investment in advance preparation for affected populations can lower associated health risks. A smoke-resilient community is resilient to smoke from any type of fire.</p><p>We must work to promote both equity in process (e.g., who has a say in decision-making) and equity in outcomes (e.g., who gets exposed to the smoke) within those communities and populations experiencing disproportionate impacts from smoke.</p><p>We are missing opportunities for positive impact by working as separate disciplines. We recommend that further and intentional integration of forest/fire and health disciplines (including the practitioners, tools and resources) needs to occur to lessen the human health effects of smoke exposure due to prescribed and managed fires.</p><p>In their conclusion, the authors point out that when all stakeholders work together to \"combat this climate and public health crisis,\" communities will be more able to meet these goals, both during and outside of wildfire season.</p><p>\"Extra attention must be given to people who have more smoke exposure, are more likely to experience health problems from smoke, and who don't have enough support to anticipate, adapt, respond or recover from smoke,\" added Dr. June Spector, senior author and associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences in the UW School of Public Health. \"These disproportionately affected populations must be included in decision-making to address inequities in smoke health impacts.\"</p><p>D'Evelyn hopes the paper will inspire more interagency and cross-disciplinary efforts and funding for research and preparation.</p><p>\"There are really wonderful community organizations working to make sure that people have access to clean air. And, there are really wonderful organizations working to do as much prescribed burning as they're allowed to lessen the smoke or lessen the severity of wildfires when they come through,\" D'Evelyn said. \"But there are gaps where communities, organizations and researchers could be collaborating to have an even bigger impact on preparedness.\"</p><p>A 2019 prescribed fire in the Deschutes National Forest in Central Oregon.Mitch Maxson/The Nature Conservancy</p><p>Other co-authors are Jihoon Jung, Ernesto Alvarado, Jill Baumgartner, Pete Caligiuri, R.

And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.</p><p>Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.</p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.</p><p>\"The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry's history,\" National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.</p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm - which can number in the millions - must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa - the nation's biggest egg producer - leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.</p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.</p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn't have any birds on their farms.</p><p>Cost to consumers</p><p>These bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.</p><p>Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what's driving prices so high.</p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That's down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.</p><p>The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.</p><p>Stopping the spread</p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.</p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.</p><p>\"We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\" said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.</p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.</p><p>\"America's egg farmers continue to double down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\" said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.</p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.</p><p>\"That's really the key - early detection. It's kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\" National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.</p><p>Low risk to humans</p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn't represent a significant threat to human health. Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. And properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses.</p><p>There has only been one human case of bird flu confirmed during this outbreak and that was a man who had been helping slaughter and remove infected birds from a Colorado farm. He recovered from the illness after a few days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Erin Hooley, Associated Press The ongoing bird flu outbreak has cost the U.S. government roughly $661 million and added to consumers' pain at the grocery store after more than 58 million birds were slaughtered to limit the spread of the virus.

Paulo Andr\u00e9 (Pexels); \"Person Playing Guitar in Grayscale Photography\" by Prajwal Bajracharya (Pexels).</p><p>At the end of March, the Philadelphia Orchestra premiered \"Vespers of the Blessed Earth,\" the most recent work of Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John Luther Adams. Critics have described \"Vespers\" as a marked, climate change-inspired departure from Adams' previous compositions - \"direct and message-driven\"; a score that \"mourns and damns, and declares where in the past Adams might have simply observed.\" But Adams is surprised that reception to \"Vespers\" has invoked so much politics.</p><p>Before pivoting to a prolific performance and composition career in his mid-thirties, Adams was a full-time environmental activist who moved to Alaska to campaign for the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and serve as executive director of the Northern Alaska Environmental Center. Prior to that, he had graduated first in his class with a degree in composition from the California Institute of the Arts. His decision to return to music after a decade in activism is perhaps a puzzling one - in light of environmental threats that have only grown more dire, would his concern for the Earth not be more useful in activism than concert halls? Yet, his music has always retained the strong influence of his love for nature: Many of his previous works, like Pulitzer prize-winning \"Become Ocean,\" are lush soundworlds more impressionistic and awe-inspired than condemnatory and wholly unlike the haunting \"Vespers,\" which are explicitly titled after a prayer service that coincides with nightfall.</p><p>It makes sense, in some ways, for people to conceive of \"Vespers\" as an overtly political statement, especially given its venue. Classical music is not an industry known for its eager embrace of change, nor is its aging audience particularly concerned about the peril of the warming climate. Patrons of classical music follow similarly: One of the leading benefactors of the Philadelphia Orchestra, who commissioned and performed \"Vespers,\" is the Hess Foundation, of Leon Hess' crude oil wealth. Adams' composition explicitly names Homo sapiens in its sung list of 192 endangered species and prominently features the lonely call of the last Kaua?i ?o?o, a bird native to Hawaii that went extinct in the 1980s. The work thus reads as rebellion in a space that has ventured only half-heartedly from its ivory tower.</p><p>Yet to Adams, this deviation from his apolitical style is completely personal - a characteristic that he previously sought to keep out of his compositions. Music, he writes in an essay shared with the HPR, \"is a spiritual discipline, and the daily practice of my art is my form of prayer.\" Like for many of us, though, the circumstances of 2020 and 2021 left an indelible mark on him, not just because of the pandemic and severe weather events, but because those events came closer to home. A massive forest fire ravaged the areas surrounding his house, and his best friend died a climate refugee. Adams bore this grief into his new composition, which he calls \"perhaps the most unabashedly personal and expressive music I've ever composed.\" With \"Vespers,\" he did not seek to sermonize but only to mourn - a friend, a home, a planet.</p><p>\"I can't help but wonder,\" Adams says in this same essay, \"If I'd voiced my grief and offered my prayers in the language of Christianity or another established religious tradition, would 'Vespers of the Blessed Earth' be received very differently, as a sacred work? Perhaps because my faith has no name, because it's grounded directly in the earth, Vespers seems to be heard as 'political art.'\" - Advertisement -</p><p>Adams seems to hit upon a particularity of the climate crisis - it has taken on such a stubbornly political character, but politics hardly encapsulates the whole of it. Admittedly, it is hard to think of an issue that fits neatly within any meaningful definition of \"political,\" but climate change is a uniquely universal plight. The wealthy can move inland to stave off the threat of coastal flooding and buy new homes after a wildfire, but outrunning the problem will not be feasible for even the very richest in a few decades. The impacts of climate change do not discriminate between believers and non-believers, as can be seen by the smog from Nova Scotia's climate change-induced wildfires that blanketed much of the East Coast in early June.</p><p>However, just 54% of American adults - a scant majority - view climate change as a major threat, and that proportion has been trending downward since 2019 across party lines. We seem to be fatigued by accelerating natural disasters and expert-generated figures foretelling our demise; we have grown so used to the alarms that we have learned to speak over them. What, then, can climate art do where decades of political activism have failed?</p><p>To borrow a metaphor from chemistry, there is an activation energy of collective will that we have not yet achieved to disrupt the equilibrium of climate apathy. More exigent than any predicted disaster, especially to electorally beholden politicians, are the threats to the millions of jobs in fossil fuel industries and the prospect of slowed short-term economic growth. It is too easy for us to ignore the existential question of climate change in favor of the ones that we know how to understand, and our transactional relationship with the environment only exacerbates it. In the current popular discourse around climate change, everything in nature is something to be captured or harnessed for every last bit of economic productivity, from the energy that powers our homes to the development of ecotourism destinations that threaten those same ecosystems. As long as this is true, we will always be able to justify our myopia.</p><p>Here I see a challenge that artists are uniquely poised to address: to help us zoom out of our man-made political quandary and establish a relationship with nature that treats its preservation as an end rather than a means to a profitable one. We can take our cues from Adams, who describes using his compositions to \"transcend myself, to be in touch with mysteries larger, older, and deeper than I can fathom.\" There is a whole host of practical considerations that we must address - how we will make equitable energy transitions and how we will triage biodiverse ecosystems - but perhaps some answers are scattered somewhere along the path to a more reverent relationship with the planet that gives us life and, lest we forget, can take it away.</p><p>The rhetoric of survival that every humanitarian and governmental agency has employed is saturated to the point of inefficacy. In its stead, it is worth imagining a role for climate art that escapes the confines of politics and leans into an essential function of good art: reminding us of our humanity and the value of the world beyond our constructed one.</p><p>Lea Wang</p><p>+ postsBio</p><p>Senior Covers Editor<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lea Wang<url normalizedValue=\"https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/Playing\">https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/Playing</url> Pretend</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lea Wang<url normalizedValue=\"https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/Declining\">https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/Declining</url> Youth Trust in American Institutions Shows No Signs of Stopping</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lea Wang<url normalizedValue=\"https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/The\">https://theharvardpoliticalreview.com/author/lwang/The</url> State of the Union: Unpacking the Recent Rise in Labor Unionization</p></bodyText></listItem></list>- Advertisement -</p><p>.tdi_100{position:relative!important;top:0;transform:none;-webkit-transform:none}.tdi_100,.tdi_100 .tdc-inner-columns{display:block}.tdi_100 .tdc-inner-columns{width:100%}@media (min-width:768px){.tdi_100{margin-left:-15px;margin-right:-15px}.tdi_100&gt;.vc_column_inner,.tdi_100&gt;.tdc-inner-columns&gt;.vc_column_inner{padding-left:15px;padding-right:15px}}@media (min-width:1019px) and (max-width:1140px){@media (min-width:768px){.tdi_100{margin-left:-10px;margin-right:-10px}.tdi_100&gt;.vc_column_inner,.tdi_100&gt;.tdc-inner-columns&gt;.vc_column_inner{padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px}}}@media (min-width:768px) and (max-width:1018px){@media (min-width:768px){.tdi_100{margin-left:-10px;margin-right:-10px}.tdi_100&gt;.vc_column_inner,.tdi_100&gt;.tdc-inner-columns&gt;.vc_column_inner{padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px}}}@media (max-width:767px){.tdi_100{width:100%!important}}</p><p>.tdi_102{vertical-align:baseline}.tdi_102 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper,.tdi_102 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper .tdc-elements{display:block}.tdi_102 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper .tdc-elements{width:100%}@media (min-width:768px) and (max-width:1018px){.tdi_102{width:100%!important}}</p><p>Share</p><p>FacebookTwitterLinkedin</p><p>Previous articleIntroducing \"It's Only a Matter of Time\"Next articleYoung People are Worried About Climate Change, and Rightfully So</p><p>.tdi_106{position:relative!important;top:0;transform:none;-webkit-transform:none}.tdi_106,.tdi_106 .tdc-inner-columns{display:block}.tdi_106 .tdc-inner-columns{width:100%}</p><p>.tdi_108{vertical-align:baseline}.tdi_108 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper,.tdi_108 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper .tdc-elements{display:block}.tdi_108 .vc_column-inner&gt;.wpb_wrapper .tdc-elements{width:100%}</p><p>- Advertisement -</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6163018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G78-2MC3-RSJP-84GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Harvard Political Review: Harvard University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 26, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

It's the first time such a forecast has been made in the area.</p><p>The heat poses a health risk, as people will need to take precautions to avoid illness. In Britain, few homes, apartments, schools or small businesses have air conditioning.</p><p>Extreme heat also is endangering the environment and homes, with wildfires raging in Portugal, Spain and France.</p><p>British authorities have described it  as a \"national emergency\" and southern Britain is under an \"extreme\" heat warning for the first time on record.</p><p>London Underground subway passengers are being advised not to travel today and Tuesday, because the heat is expected to affect rails.</p><p>Already deadly heat; raging wildfires</p><p>In Spain, 237 deaths have occurred due to high temperatures this month, according to the country's Carlos III Institute, which records temperature-related fatalities daily.</p><p>The heat has helped fuel wildfires in multiple countries:</p><p>In France, firefighters struggled Saturday to contain a huge wildfire that raced across pine forests in the Bordeaux region for a fifth straight day.</p><p>In Portugal, more than 160 people have been injured by wildfires and hundreds have been forced to evacuate. The pilot of a firefighting plane also died when his plane crashed.</p><p>Spain is also battling several wildfires, including two that have burned about 18,200 acres and caused around 3,000 people to be evacuated.</p><p>British authorities issued their first ever \"red\" warning for extreme heat, declaring a national emergency as forecasters predict temperatures will put people, even those who are otherwise healthy, at risk of serious illness and death.</p><p>In the U.K., the warning covers today  and Tuesday, when temperatures in southeast Britain, home to London, may reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit . The British record is 101.7 degrees, set in 2019.</p><p>Temperatures in the interior of the Portugal were forecast to hit 111 degrees Fahrenheit,and could reach as much as 120 degrees in coming days, according to AccuWeather.</p><p>Sevilla, Spain has been a hot spot, recording a temperature of 105 for nine straight days. Parts of the country could reach 120, AccuWeather said.</p><p>Leaders point</p><p>to climate change</p><p>The chances of temperatures such as those forecast  already are 10 times higher than they would have been without human activity, said Nikos Christidis, a climate scientist with the U.K.'s Met Office.</p><p>\"We hoped we wouldn't get to this situation, but for the first time ever we are forecasting greater than 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) in the U.K.,\" he said. \"In a recent study we found that the likelihood of extremely hot days in the U.K. has been increasing and will continue to do so during the course of the century.\"</p><p>The U.K. Health Security Agency increased its own hot weather alert to the highest level, putting it to \"national emergency.\" The warning system was created in 2004, when concerns about climate change spurred authorities to develop their first plan to protect the public from severe heat.</p><p>Contributing: Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A forest fire reaches an empty house as smoke darkens the sky Bemposta, central Portugal, on Wednesday.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Fires have forced dozens</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>to evacuate their homes.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUIDNW-usa2414436069</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YF-31V1-DXGX-60NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 18, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

Bambi, despite his success in a popular Disney movie, wouldn't do, either.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Only Smokey Bear - a little bear cub who was found after a forest fire on May 9, 1950 - could do the job.</p><p>1937</p><p> President Franklin D. Roosevelt launches a national campaign to reduce forest fires. Posters featuring Uncle Sam as a forest ranger tell people \"Our forests - Our fault.\"</p><p>1942</p><p> A Japanese submarine surfaces off the coast and fires on an oil field near Santa Barbara, Calif. Damage is minimal, but officials realize Los Padres National Forest is at risk. With resources at a premium during wartime, fire safety becomes an even higher priority.</p><p>1944</p><p>Disney makes a one-year deal to loan Bambi and his friends to the forest fire prevention campaign. The campaign is a success, but ad executives realize they need an animal symbol of their own.</p><p> AUG. 9 A new campaign is launched featuring a bear. The first poster, drawn pro bono by illustrator Albert Staehle, shows a character he calls Smokey pouring water on a campfire. He says he started with a raccoonbut thought it looked too</p><p>much \"like a bandit.\"</p><p>1947</p><p> The very successful Smokey Bear campaign continues in the postwar years with the new slogan, \"Only you.\"</p><p>1950</p><p> MAY 9 A group of firefighters narrowly escapes disaster near Capitan, N.M., by taking refuge on a rock slide as the fire burns over them.</p><p> Afterward, they find a bear cub - his fur singed and his paws badly burned - clinging to a charred tree. Named Hotfoot Teddy, the cub is nursed back to health by a New Mexico game warden and his family.</p><p> JUNE 27 Now famous, the cub is flown to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., to become the living embodiment of Smokey Bear. The U.S. Postal Service eventually gives Smokey his own ZIP code when he begins receiving up to 13,000 letters a week.</p><p>1952</p><p> A song, \"Smokey the Bear\" - written by Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins, the same guys who wrote \"Peter Cottontail\" and \"Frosty the Snowman\" - becomes a big hit. Rollins adds \"the\" to Smokey's name to make the lyrics fit better. As a result, a generation or two of children grow up calling the character \"Smokey the Bear\" instead of just \"Smokey Bear.\"</p><p> MAY 23 Congress passes the Smokey Bear Act, taking Smokey out of the public domain and preserving the trademark for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More important, the move earmarks revenue from sales of Smokey toys and memorabilia for fire prevention awareness efforts.</p><p>1971</p><p> A new cub, Little Smokey, joins Smokey in the National Zoo. He, too, was born in a New Mexico forest and rescued from starvation by park rangers.</p><p>1975</p><p> MAY 2 Smokey, old and arthritic and still suffering from his injuries, is officially retired from public service. Little Smokey is officially named his successor as \"Smokey II.\"</p><p>1976</p><p> NOV. 9 Smokey dies at age 26. His remains are flown back to near where he was found in New Mexico. More than 250 people attend his memorial service. Two days after the funeral, an obituary runs on Page 1 of the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>1979</p><p> Smokey Bear Historical Park is completed near Capitan, at the grave of the original Smokey. The park includes a museum.</p><p>1990</p><p> AUG. 11 Smokey II dies.</p><p>2020</p><p> While both Smokey and Smokey II have died, the character lives on.

And the rest is history. I did go to work, and I\u2019ve been here ever since,\u201d Ringleberg said.</p><p>This year, she has been working 10-hour days six days a week since May 8.</p><p>But Ringleberg still has time to bring her violin up to the tower and said she's \u201cable to practice while shuffling some looks around to make sure that I\u2019m keeping up on what\u2019s happening in the landscape around me.\u201d</p><p>Another aspect of her job is welcoming tower visitors.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy having them because everybody is interesting, everybody comes from a different walk of life. I get upwards of 1,000 people each season visiting up here,\u201d Ringleberg said. \u201cMy tower is 11 by 11 (feet) in dimension, so there is room for visitors to come up and it\u2019s just 31 feet off the ground, so that\u2019s not too intimidating for a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>Ringleberg said she has has the same level of vigilance now that she did 30 years ago.</p><p>But with two grandchildren now, she knows she can\u2019t do the job much longer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be emotional for me to give this up. I do want it to be continued,\u201d Ringleberg said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably somebody out there who is going to take it over for me.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s wonderful because I want this tower to be enjoyed and utilized by the public and to continue to be a service to this urban interface. That\u2019s my great hope, that somebody will come along who has as much interest in it as I have had over the years,\u201d she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-d6824ba2df231a80fc290ebc45c476d220220625</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65SJ-2N61-DYMD-64M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><timeReceived>8:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The Science for Nature and People Partnership led the organization of these discussions.</p><p>On May 2, more than two dozen of those participants published a paper in the journal Current Environmental Health Reports that is part review of current scientific understanding of the issues and health impacts and part consensus report on how to deal with them.</p><p>\"It started as a conversation between experts who think about fire from really different angles in order to find how we can address fire through an interdisciplinary lens,\" said lead author Savannah D'Evelyn, a postdoctoral fellow in UW's Department of Environmental &amp; Occupational Health Sciences. \"It took a little bit to get to the fact that it was really smoke that brought us all together. We kind of had to set a baseline for what peoples' starting points were -- all smoke is bad smoke from a public health perspective, but we can't do fire management without more fire.\"</p><p>That working group -- comprised of scientists, practitioners and managers who specialize in areas of forest and fire ecology, fire safety, air quality, health care and public health -- agreed on six statements and recommendations as part of its \"interdisciplinary approach\" to the issues.</p><p>\"The Nature Conservancy is dedicated to an evidence-based approach to forest and fire management practices that supports the health of both nature and people. These consensus statements aim to serve as guideposts for forest health and public health professionals to work together to promote healthy and resilient forests and communities,\" said Ryan Haugo, co-author and director of conservation science for The Nature Conservancy in Oregon.</p><p>The first consensus statement addresses the issue of the long-running effort to suppress all forest fires versus the historic practices of Indigenous peoples:</p><p>\"We recognize the need to listen to and integrate a diversity of perspectives, in particular those embodied by Indigenous peoples who have successfully used fire as an ecological tool for thousands of years,\" the authors wrote.</p><p>\"I've often heard from Tribal leaders how controlled burns were one of many tools they employed historically to steward healthy ecosystems,\" said Gillian Mittelstaedt, co-author and executive director of the Tribal Healthy Homes Network. \"This Tribal knowledge has been overlooked, perilously, during decades of European colonization, and federal land management practices. It is only in recent years, as forest ecosystems decline in health, that Western science has begun to recognize and learn from the innate sensibility and sustainability of traditional Tribal burning practices.\"</p><p>Here are the other five consensus statements:</p><p>Prescribed fires in addition to managed fires for resource benefit are both necessary management techniques to keep forests resilient and to lessen the negative ecological and public health impacts of wildfires.</p><p>Certain regions of the Western U.S. will experience more smoke days with heightened use of prescribed and managed fire; however, we expect the impacts of smoke exposure to be reduced over the long term in comparison with untreated land burned by wildfires. With these techniques, exposure in affected communities can be planned and lessened.</p><p>No degree of smoke exposure is without risk. However, additional investment in advance preparation for affected populations can lower associated health risks. A smoke-resilient community is resilient to smoke from any type of fire.</p><p>We must work to promote both equity in process (e.g., who has a say in decision-making) and equity in outcomes (e.g., who gets exposed to the smoke) within those communities and populations experiencing disproportionate impacts from smoke.</p><p>We are missing opportunities for positive impact by working as separate disciplines. We recommend that further and intentional integration of forest/fire and health disciplines (including the practitioners, tools and resources) needs to occur to lessen the human health effects of smoke exposure due to prescribed and managed fires.</p><p>In their conclusion, the authors point out that when all stakeholders work together to \"combat this climate and public health crisis,\" communities will be more able to meet these goals, both during and outside of wildfire season.</p><p>\"Extra attention must be given to people who have more smoke exposure, are more likely to experience health problems from smoke, and who don't have enough support to anticipate, adapt, respond or recover from smoke,\" added Dr. June Spector, senior author and associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences in the UW School of Public Health. \"These disproportionately affected populations must be included in decision-making to address inequities in smoke health impacts.\"</p><p>D'Evelyn hopes the paper will inspire more interagency and cross-disciplinary efforts and funding for research and preparation.</p><p>\"There are really wonderful community organizations working to make sure that people have access to clean air. And, there are really wonderful organizations working to do as much prescribed burning as they're allowed to lessen the smoke or lessen the severity of wildfires when they come through,\" D'Evelyn said. \"But there are gaps where communities, organizations and researchers could be collaborating to have an even bigger impact on preparedness.\"</p><p>Other co-authors are Jihoon Jung, Ernesto Alvarado, Jill Baumgartner, Pete Caligiuri, R.

Those are the people the West Virginia Black Bears' Hometown Hero program honors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For each of the team's six Friday home games at Monongalia County Ballpark, a hometown hero is named from nominations made by the community.</p><p>Each hero is awarded with free tickets to the game and the Black Bears' promotional team makes a short video highlighting their accomplishments that is shown on the video board at the game and posted to social media.</p><p>The first of these heroes, Roark Sizemore, founder and president of Pantry Plus More in Westover, was honored at a game on June 24.</p><p>Friday night, the second of these heroes, Brookhaven VFD Chief Jimmy Lipscomb, was recognized for his decades of service to the Monongalia County community.</p><p>According to Brookhaven VFD, Lipscomb has been chief for nearly 40 years and is the longest active volunteer chief in Monongalia County.</p><p>Lipscomb said he started at Brookhaven in 1978, working his way up through the ranks to become chief in 1985.</p><p>In the last 40 years, Lipscomb has been involved in starting both the first Hazmat Team in West Virginia and the first volunteer brush fire team in Monongalia County.</p><p>Lipscomb is a state certified forest fire warden and certified state fire instructor. He also spent time as a wildland firefighter in both Montana and Idaho.</p><p>He became certified as a hazmat specialist in 2001 dealing with anthrax and assisted FEMA with hurricane relief for both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p><p>In addition, Lipscomb is an emergency medical responder and is also certified in aircraft rescue, swift water rescue, is a level 2 ropes instructor and more.</p><p>Trevor Dolan, sponsorship and sales manager for the Black Bears said Hometown Heroes are chosen from nominations from the community.</p><p>The Black Bears' promotions team said there was an overwhelming number of people from the community come forward to second Lipscomb's nomination \u2014 \"which we take as a very good sign.\"</p><p>\"We have a submission page for it on our website. We open it to the public and they submit who they would like to honor, \" Dolan said. \"They put in some information and then write about why they should be recognized. Myself and my interns will then go through the submissions and decide on which ones have truly made an impact to the Morgantown area.\"</p><p>Dolan and his team don't have the final say though. Since the promotion is sponsored by Fred L. Jenkins Funeral Home, Dolan's team sends a list of the people they would like to honor for one last screening.</p><p>\"They then have the final decision on who we honor, \" Dolan said.</p><p>There will be four more Hometown Heroes honored at home games this season, but those honorees have not yet been determined.</p><p>If you know any \"ordinary people doing extraordinary things \" you can nominate them on the Black Bear's website\u2014mlbdraftleague.com /west-virginia and clicking the community link.</p><p>A link to the nomination form can also be found on Fred L.

He wanted to use the song's title for the album to connect the group to its hometown roots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With an album name selected and the tracklist completed, the group was almost ready to release its project - a glitchy, post- rap album that pushes the boundaries of what is considered rap.</p><p>Shortly after, Groggs tragically passed away at the young age of 32 on June 29, 2020. Survived by his partner, Anna Ford, and their four kids, Joey, Jayden, Toph and Ari, Groggs was such a loving person whose death left a hole in so many people's hearts, including mine.</p><p>Over a year later, the group finished the album in his memory and released it on Sept. 16. It feels like nothing else Injury Reserve made before. Compared to their 2019 self-titled album that has upbeat songs like \"Gravy n' Biscuits\" and \"Three Man Weave,\" this is such a left turn.</p><p>That's for the better, though. While the album may have been written before Groggs' passing, every song feels raw and emotional, like they were made with his death in mind.</p><p>Take \"Top Picks for You,\" the seventh track on the album, for example. Ritchie raps: \"I scan the room, I see bits and pieces of you scattered / It's those same patterns that gon' get us through the next chapter.\"</p><p>It feels like Ritchie is talking directly to Groggs, especially later in the song: \"Just workin' so that you can just / jump right back in / But you ain't jumpin' back here.\"</p><p>With proper context, these lines might've been intended for Ritchie's step-father, who passed away during the making of the album. Still, it's hard not to see the parallels, which makes it that much more heartbreaking.</p><p>These heavy lyrics with amazing production by Corey create this chaotic feeling that shook my bones. Songs like \"Superman That\" and \"Footwork in a Forest Fire\" give me goosebumps even after several listens.</p><p>\"Footwork in a Forest Fire\" is especially chilling given the context of anti-police protests and riots that happened during the time the song was made.</p><p>Groggs raps, \"Yeah, we down to ride / said, we down to riot / Sorry mama, I try my best / To no longer be polite / They tryna take my life / And they take my rights / Yeah, this the sign / Sign of the times.\"</p><p>The most chilling part of it all is that, even a year removed from the context these songs were written in, they are just as contemporary and relevant.</p><p>However, even though I love this album as an Injury Reserve fan (I was lucky enough to see them live at the Middle East in Boston in 2018), I honestly don't know how I would feel about this album if I didn't know the context and meaning behind what I was hearing.</p><p>Calling this a rap album isn't telling the full truth. Many songs take inspiration and samples from rock and punk works. It's something I rarely hear from a rap album.</p><p>This is far from their most approachable work as a group. They have plenty of other great songs that many rap fans would love, like \"S on Ya Chest\" and \"Jailbreak the Tesla,\" that it's hard to recommend this album to people who have never heard of Injury Reserve before.</p><p>If you're at all interested in hearing more from these incredible artists, I recommend their 2016 album \"Floss.\" Although I'm not going to sing any of these songs in the shower, they are an emotional roller coaster of a project that will stay in my head for a long time.</p><p>3.5/5 Suns</p><p>Connor Lawless</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5090019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NX-DV01-JBSN-30VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Chronicle: Quinnipiac University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 22, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Hamden</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009U6M</classCode><className>RAP MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001498</classCode><className>RIOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009XCO</classCode><className>STEPPARENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX540</classCode><className>PHOENIX, AZ, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS118</classCode><className>ARIZONA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused, but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with the commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to the complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggest the world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to the European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2024, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The US Air Force wants $5.8 billion to build 1,000 AI-driven unmanned combat aircraft, possibly more, as part of its next generation air dominance initiative. The autonomous aircraft are ideal for completing suicide missions and protecting pilots. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. In 2023, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $55.9 billion defense budget for fiscal 2024, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in the military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield. Recently in August 2023, Indonesia announced plans to buy 12 Turkish military drones for $300 million.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while the hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>In January 2024, German UAV manufacturer and transport company Wingcopter announced the extension and expansion of its delivery project providing groceries to small, remote villages using drones.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In October 2023, Zipline announced a new partnership with healthcare giant Cleveland Clinic involving an evolving operation that will begin with drone delivery of medication directly to patients' homes. The aerial delivery of specialized medicines and prescriptions will be among the first uses of the partnership.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. In December 2023, the Texas city of Arlington announced plans to launch a trial using drones and robotic ground vehicles to deliver packages from a local food bank to recipient homes in a bid to reduce the number of vans and emissions.</p><p>Scotland has launched world's first nation-wide medical drone delivery network with the completion of its first live trial flight near Glasgow. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, clean, and relatively inexpensive aerial transportation network to spirit medicines, lab samples, and other supplies to facilities across the nation.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In October 2023, Japan's SkyDrive received 12.4 billion yen ($82.7 million) from the government of Japan to support the development of the startup's electric vertical takeoff and landing craft (eVTOL). In June 2023, defense and security UAV specialist group Red Cat Holdings raised $1.2 million in new funding to develop a new, portable UAV as standard issue equipment for soldiers. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to set up a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there have been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every newly produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>The enthusiasm for drone delivery space is visible in the funding so far in 2023. In the first half of 2023, drone delivery startups have raised nearly $1.5 billion, almost equal to the figure for the full year 2022, according to data from Crunchbase. Zipline topped the list of drone delivery related companies with a total funding of $813 million in the first half of 2023.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects a greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Amazon is set to launch its drone delivery service in UK and Italy by the end of 2024. The expansion follows successful operations in the US, where the service has already delivered thousands of packages.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratories. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini-UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini-UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini-UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro-UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro-UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first-time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying overcrowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector, despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hacking. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones could be a source of public nuisance.

Officials reopened roads and a major bridge in the region. <br/>But the mayor of nearby Aigialeias, Dimitris Kalogeropoulos, called the fire \"an immense catastrophe\". <br/> Five villages have been evacuated and eight people were hospitalised with burns and respiratory problems after the fire broke out Photo: Eurokinissi / STR  <br/>\"There has not yet been an official assessment of the damage, but around 10 houses in the area of Ziria have burnt down, as well as farming sheds and stables -- which is a lot for the residents of the region who make their living from agriculture,\" he told the ANA news agency. <br/><br/>The fire broke out early Saturday near Patras, in the Peloponnese, about 210 kilometres (130 miles) west of Athens, and officials evacuated five villages and a seaside town. Eight people were hospitalised with burns and respiratory problems. <br/>Aigialeias' town hall provided emergency accommodation for villagers who fled their homes. <br/>\"We've been through hell,\" one resident of Ziria, Giorgos Alexopoulos, told AFP. \"We were scared we would lose everything in the flames.\" <br/> According to the civil protection agency, 58 forest fires have broken out over the past 24 hours, although most were quickly brought under control Photo: Eurokinissi / STR  <br/> The seaside resort of Loggos was also evacuated, emergency services sending nearly 100 residents and tourists to the nearby city of Aigio. <br/>The local newspaper, the Patras Times, reported that flames had destroyed around 30 houses, farming sheds and stables in the villages of Ziria, Kamares, Achaias and Labiri. Local olive groves were also destroyed in the fire, it added. <br/> According to the civil protection agency, 58 forest fires have broken out over the past 24 hours, although most were quickly brought under control Photo: Eurokinissi / STR  <br/>Civil Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoidis, who visited the scene on Sunday, said the situation had improved since Saturday. <br/>\"A hundred properties have been saved thanks to the firefighters' battle against the flames,\" he said. \"We remain cautious and will support our citizens affected by this fire.\" <br/>On Saturday, officials closed a motorway in the region as well as the Rio-Antirrio bridge across the Gulf of Corinth connecting the Peloponnese and mainland Greece, ANA reported, but they were reopened Sunday. <br/>Hospitals in Patras and Aigio were put on alert, as well as the coastguard. <br/>According to the civil protection agency, 60 forest fires have broken out over the past 24 hours, although most were quickly brought under control. <br/>On Sunday, 67 firefighters using 20 vehicles were battling a fresh fire that broke out on Rhodes, in the Pandanassa region, helped by three water-carrying planes and four helicopters. <br/>The EU's European Forest Fire Information System said 13,511 hectares (334 acres) had been burnt Sunday. <br/>Greece is hit by forest fires every summer, but experts have warned that global warming increases both their frequency and intensity. <br/>The country has been in the grip of a new heat wave since Friday, with temperatures hovering between 42 and 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit), weather forecasters say. <br/>Several days ago, a fire ravaged Mount Penteli, close to the capital Athens, but it caused no casualties. <br/>A fire in the same area began in July 2018 that went on to claim 102 lives in Greece's worst-ever toll from a forest inferno. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162785074066125879100241</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638P-RRX1-F03R-N3KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 1, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The council includes youth from across the country who are interested in supporting disaster preparedness and making a difference in their communities. Students complete disaster preparedness projects nationally and locally. FEMA Region 8, which includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, currently has two representatives. They are Lauren Coval and Isaac Doll, both from Colorado.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A highlight for members is the FEMA Youth Preparedness Council Summit, which takes place in July, kicking off the year. The 2022 virtual summit included visits from the Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff, former FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino, and current FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. The council members also participated in panel discussions related to equity and climate change.</p><p>\"FEMA Region 8 congratulates Lauren and Isaac for selection to the National Youth Preparedness Council,\" said Regional Administrator Nancy Dragani. \"Young people like them are the future of emergency management. They have a unique opportunity to help make our nation more prepared, and they are starting at the grassroots level.\"</p><p>Lauren was inspired to join the council after seeing the devastation in several wildfires in Colorado, such as the Waldo Canyon Fire in 2012 and the Black Forest Fire in 2013. \"After that, I really wanted to help my community. Seeing all the suffering and loss, I just wanted to help people.\"</p><p>Lauren started her school's first Teen Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) and even hosted a Wildfire Preparedness Day in her community with local law enforcement and firefighters. She aspires to encourage more formal emergency preparedness disaster curricula in schools. \"I saw so many people moving to Colorado that it inspired me to educate others on our crazy weather and environment,\" she said. \"One of my biggest passions is education.\"</p><p>Isaac, who is in his second year with the council, was encouraged to apply for the council because of his passion for psychology. As a now experienced member, he hopes to explore how to prepare people for the psychological effects of disasters. Isaac is also an AmeriCorps member, a U.S. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps member, and a psychology student at Montana State University. During his first year with the council, Isaac and his team created a website featuring preparedness information for young people -- <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youthprep4all.org\">www.youthprep4all.org</url>.</p><p>\"We really wanted to focus on underserved communities and people with disabilities,\" Isaac said. \"Coming from different backgrounds on the council, we worked together on that.\"</p><p>Lauren and Isaac will join fellow members from across the country to complete new projects related to preparedness. They also serve as ambassadors for other young people to get involved with preparedness in their own communities.</p><p>\"Young people have a lot of great ideas,\" said Isaac. \"They could start a Teen CERT, or just sit down with their neighbors. You just need to start talking.\"</p><p>\"I'm excited for what my team is going to be doing this year for our project,\" said Lauren. \"I'm in the community engagement group and our focus is equity and inclusion.\"</p><p>If you or a young person you know are interested in following in Lauren and Isaac's footsteps, learn more at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/youth-preparedness-council\">https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/youth-preparedness-council</url>.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20220825/fema-region-8-recognizes-colorado-students-selected-national-youth\">https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20220825/fema-region-8-recognizes-colorado-students-selected-national-youth</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7928981 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7928981</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667R-06B1-JC11-11T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 26, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They will also have the opportunity to work with top-tier design, engineering, and brand experts to help them refine and scale their solutions for the commercial market. Additionally, startups will gain access to JVP's expansive global network, which includes investors, industrial leaders, and other entrepreneurs.</p><p>\"We're thrilled to be launching the newest cohort of climate tech startups as part of our URBAN-X program,\" said Mike Peyton, President of MINI Business Innovations LLC, and Vice President of MINI of the Americas. \"MINI was founded on innovating sustainable mobility for city dwellers and today, we're committed to driving positive change in urban environments. Supporting the next generation of climate tech founders and startups is essential in achieving this mission and helping our country reach its climate goals.\"</p><p>\"Cohort 12 includes some of the most inventive and devoted technologists we have seen throughout the years,\" said Johan Schwind, Managing Director of URBAN-X. \"As calls for climate action grow louder across the globe, we are excited to work alongside these changemakers and support them in bringing their visions to life across our cities.\"</p><p>Since 2016, URBAN-X has supported more than 80 startups spanning 14 countries to address complex challenges facing cities.

The council includes youth from across the country who are interested in supporting disaster preparedness and making a difference in their communities. Students complete disaster preparedness projects nationally and locally. FEMA Region 8, which includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, currently has two representatives. They are Lauren Coval and Isaac Doll, both from Colorado.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A highlight for members is the FEMA Youth Preparedness Council Summit, which takes place in July, kicking off the year. The 2022 virtual summit included visits from the Second Gentlemen Doug Emhoff, former FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino, and current FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. The council members also participated in panel discussions related to equity and climate change.</p><p>\"FEMA Region 8 congratulates Lauren and Isaac for selection to the National Youth Preparedness Council,\" said Regional Administrator Nancy Dragani. \"Young people like them are the future of emergency management. They have a unique opportunity to help make our nation more prepared, and they are starting at the grassroots level.\"</p><p>Lauren was inspired to join the council after seeing the devastation in several wildfires in Colorado, such as the Waldo Canyon Fire in 2012 and the Black Forest Fire in 2013. \"After that, I really wanted to help my community. Seeing all the suffering and loss, I just wanted to help people.\"</p><p>Lauren started her school's first Teen Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) and even hosted a Wildfire Preparedness Day in her community with local law enforcement and firefighters. She aspires to encourage more formal emergency preparedness disaster curricula in schools. \"I saw so many people moving to Colorado that it inspired me to educate others on our crazy weather and environment,\" she said. \"One of my biggest passions is education.\"</p><p>Isaac, who is in his second year with the council, was encouraged to apply for the council because of his passion for psychology. As a now experienced member, he hopes to explore how to prepare people for the psychological effects of disasters. Isaac is also an AmeriCorps member, a U.S. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps member, and a psychology student at Montana State University. During his first year with the council, Isaac and his team created a website featuring preparedness information for young people -- <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youthprep4all.org\">www.youthprep4all.org</url>.</p><p>\"We really wanted to focus on underserved communities and people with disabilities,\" Isaac said. \"Coming from different backgrounds on the council, we worked together on that.\"</p><p>Lauren and Isaac will join fellow members from across the country to complete new projects related to preparedness. They also serve as ambassadors for other young people to get involved with preparedness in their own communities.</p><p>\"Young people have a lot of great ideas,\" said Isaac. \"They could start a Teen CERT, or just sit down with their neighbors. You just need to start talking.\"</p><p>\"I'm excited for what my team is going to be doing this year for our project,\" said Lauren. \"I'm in the community engagement group and our focus is equity and inclusion.\"</p><p>If you or a young person you know are interested in following in Lauren and Isaac's footsteps, learn more at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/youth-preparedness-council\">https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/individuals-communities/youth-preparedness-council</url>.

His testimony is here and the hearing can be viewed here.</p><p>O'Neill explained how changing markets and climate, and advances in science, engineering and technology have led to new ways to manage our forests and add value to its products, but require an increasingly educated workforce.</p><p>\"Accelerating innovation in forest products and training a skilled workforce that meets the current and emerging needs of these new products and practices is key to meeting the increasing global demand for low-carbon materials, chemicals and fuels that can come from forests,\" O'Neill testified.</p><p>Maine's own Rep. Chellie Pingree serves on the subcommittee and participated in the hearing.</p><p>She lauded the FOR/Maine initiative that includes UMaine and industry, community, government and other partners for working together since 2016 to reposition the state's forest economy, and a recent workforce analysis prepared for FOR/Maine by O'Neill and colleagues from UMaine and the University of Southern Maine. That analysis projected 7,600 positions in the sector would open over the next 15 years, and recommended specific strategies to meet that employer demand including an education and awareness campaign showcasing career opportunities in the modern forest economy, outreach to middle and high school students leveraging the younger generation's interest in sustainability, and attracting those seeking to relocate after military service.</p><p>\"With extensive expertise, broad relationships, statewide reach, and research and development capacity across the forest economy and beyond, the R1 University of Maine is critical to this collaboration, providing knowledge-based information and innovations to deliver on FOR/Maine's strategic objectives. And, as the largest generator of graduates in the state, we can most impact the size and skill of the workforce for this sector,\" O'Neill also told the subcommittee.</p><p>\"Our work, and the workforce we are developing, has never been more essential to Maine and our nation's ability to sustainably manage and utilize our forest resources, mitigate forest fire and invasive risks, sequester carbon, improve clean air, water, and habitat, and protect the economic foundation and identity of many rural communities.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>View links showing in text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2022/05/26/umaine-industry-liaison-testifies-to-congress-about-preparing-future-forest-workforce/\">https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2022/05/26/umaine-industry-liaison-testifies-to-congress-about-preparing-future-forest-workforce/</url></p><p>Contact: Ashley Forbes, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashley.forbes@maine.edu\">ashley.forbes@maine.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7848210 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7848210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J9-MG21-DYG2-R1JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 27, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

No injures have been reported.</p><p>The fire, 70% contained as of Monday afternoon, is expected to be completely under control later this week - but could consume about 15,000 acres before then, New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Greg McLaughlin said at a news briefing Monday afternoon.</p><p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but McLaughlin said officials have ruled out natural causes.</p><p>\"The majority of our forest fires are human caused and it's important to recognize that because it places it within our power to avoid circumstances like this,\" said Shawn LaTourette, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.</p><p>McLaughlin said there was \"really extreme fire intensity\" throughout the day Sunday due to dry conditions and high winds. The fire moved back and forth across the Mullica River. Firefighters were unable to make a direct attack on the fire and instead had to start backfires to burn vegetation around the perimeter.</p><p>\"The fire moved in different directions. It spread quickly and with high intensity,\" McLaughlin said.</p><p>Officials shut down the Mullica River Campground, its trail, and related water activities, such as boating. Pine-lands Adventures suspended all its canoe and kayak operations and by late Sunday night, the Paradise Lakes Campground had been evacuated.</p><p>There were 18 structures threatened by the fire, McLaughlin said, at state and private campgrounds and several farms, including blueberry and cranberry farms. Firefighters have created barriers with backfires around those structures to protect them.</p><p>By Monday, authorities shut down sections of Routes 206 and 542.</p><p>Batsto Village and all its trails, the Atsion Recreation Area, and the Lower Forde Campground were all added to the list of closures.</p><p>McLaughlin said there wasn't any threat as of Monday afternoon that residential areas would need to be evacuated.</p><p>The smell of smoke from the fire traveled as far as the Jersey Shore, reaching Ventnor and Ocean City.</p><p>Local volunteer fire departments from Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean Counties have been providing protection to the 18 structures threatened by the fire.</p><p>Fire authorities said they would continue with backfire operations to contain the fire and asked the public to steer clear and not fly drones in the area.</p><p>McLaughlin said the fire could be mostly contained by late Monday night, and he expected it could be 100% contained Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on whether it rains. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:xconde@inquirer.com\">xconde@inquirer.com</email></p><p>XimenaReports</p><p>Staff writers Amy S.

Residents or drivers who see smoke in the area southwest of Rawlings should be aware that it may appear to be a forest fire, but is deliberate and controlled and there is no need to report it to authorities.</p><p>The fire will create smoke but it will be a controlled flame targeting underbrush and ground cover debris. Access to the wildlife management area at its primitive camping area and at Middle Ridge Road will be limited during the burn, due to potential for low visibility, but will reopen as soon as the burn is completed.</p><p>The purpose of the burn is to improve habitat for wildlife and to restore stands of pitch pine and table mountain pine that are more than 90 years old.</p><p>\"The flames will open up the pine cones which provide food for wildlife, and help a new generation of seedlings to grow,\" Wildlife and Heritage Service Habitat Manager Rick Latshaw said. \"Numerous other benefits such as reduced wildfire fuel and improved regeneration of oak are also goals of the burn.\"</p><p>DNR will conduct the burn with trained wildland firefighters and equipment present to assure safety and efficiency.

His testimony is here and the hearing can be viewed here.</p><p>O'Neill explained how changing markets and climate, and advances in science, engineering and technology have led to new ways to manage our forests and add value to its products, but require an increasingly educated workforce.</p><p>\"Accelerating innovation in forest products and training a skilled workforce that meets the current and emerging needs of these new products and practices is key to meeting the increasing global demand for low-carbon materials, chemicals and fuels that can come from forests,\" O'Neill testified.</p><p>Maine's own Rep. Chellie Pingree serves on the subcommittee and participated in the hearing.</p><p>She lauded the FOR/Maine initiative that includes UMaine and industry, community, government and other partners for working together since 2016 to reposition the state's forest economy, and a recent workforce analysis prepared for FOR/Maine by O'Neill and colleagues from UMaine and the University of Southern Maine. That analysis projected 7,600 positions in the sector would open over the next 15 years, and recommended specific strategies to meet that employer demand including an education and awareness campaign showcasing career opportunities in the modern forest economy, outreach to middle and high school students leveraging the younger generation's interest in sustainability, and attracting those seeking to relocate after military service.</p><p>\"With extensive expertise, broad relationships, statewide reach, and research and development capacity across the forest economy and beyond, the R1 University of Maine is critical to this collaboration, providing knowledge-based information and innovations to deliver on FOR/Maine's strategic objectives. And, as the largest generator of graduates in the state, we can most impact the size and skill of the workforce for this sector,\" O'Neill also told the subcommittee.</p><p>\"Our work, and the workforce we are developing, has never been more essential to Maine and our nation's ability to sustainably manage and utilize our forest resources, mitigate forest fire and invasive risks, sequester carbon, improve clean air, water, and habitat, and protect the economic foundation and identity of many rural communities.\"</p><p>Contact: Ashley Forbes, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashley.forbes@maine.edu\">ashley.forbes@maine.edu</email> For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4115827</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J8-GCF1-JDKC-R4D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"503\"/><timeReceived>9:32 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd.

Nvidia will announce its first-quarter results soon and its guidance will likely be more important than its actual first-quarter results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The G7 meeting in Japan will be interesting this week. Germany is in disagreement with Britain and France over support for natural gas.</p><p> In fact, Germany has strived to label natural gas as 'green.' In North America, we do not know what to do with all the natural gas that we have, which is why in North Dakota natural gas in their crude oil fields is 'flared,' since there are no pipelines to transport natural gas.</p><p> So if California, New York, Britain and France succeed in curtailing natural gas usage, the excess natural gas will be increasingly flared and burned anyway.</p><p> I remain perplexed by the seemingly growing war against natural gas, especially since natural gas will be needed to make the hydrogen that the green folks are calling for as the fuel of the future. Currently, green hydrogen is cost-prohibitive.</p><p> Futile Carbon Capture</p><p> Speaking of carbon emissions, Alberta is burning as are boreal forests in Russia from thunderstorms. In Alberta alone, over 1 million acres have burned this year and caused 30,000 people to relocate.</p><p> The annual wildfires in Alberta often disrupt crude oil and natural gas production and 320,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent representing 3.7% of Alberta's production were offline last week. The boreal forests in Alberta and Russia have ground characterized by peat, which is next to impossible to put out until snow falls on the forest floor.</p><p> As a result of an early start to the boreal forest fire season this year, 2023 will likely set the record for carbon emissions. Naturally, the G7 has no plan to squelch these seasonal forest fires, so the green police literally cannot see the forest through the trees.</p><p> ScienceAdvances published a study last year forecasting that the annual boreal forest fires in the Northern Hemisphere could release 12 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year into the atmosphere. Historically, forest fires have accounted for approximately 25% of global carbon emissions.</p><p> By comparison, the International Energy Agency said that carbon dioxide emissions from energy and industry globally hit a record of 36.8 gigatons in 2022 due to China, India and other emerging economies.</p><p> So for everybody worried about carbon dioxide emissions, which were not originally named in the Clean Air Act, the real problems are natural forest fires from thunderstorms as well as fossil fuels, especially coal, in emerging economies.</p><p> As a result, I am not sure the G7 or COP28 cannot do much to impact global carbon emissions. Naturally, I should add that a super volcano could also erupt and boost carbon emissions, so there is virtually nothing that mankind can do about it, other than to maybe tap into geothermal energy for electricity generation.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal had a great article about 'carbon capture.' There is only one commercial power plant in North America, namely the Boundary Dam Power Station Unit 3 in Saskatchewan, Alberta, which is a coal-fired power plant that is fitted with a $1.1 billion carbon-capture system.</p><p> SaskPower said the benefits of operating a coal-fired power plant utilizing carbon capture are becoming less apparent, which is raising doubts about the Biden Administration's goal of achieving carbon dioxide-free electricity by 2035.</p><p> The oil industry has been experimenting with carbon capture technology to recover more oil from existing wells, which is where much of SaskPower's carbon dioxide is piped 36 miles to extract more crude oil from geological formations.</p><p> The only commercial-scale carbon capture plant in the U.S. was the Petra Nova coal-fired plant in Texas which closed after operating for three years in 2020.</p><p> Even if carbon capture can be perfected, the next corundum is, will it be profitable where there are no producing oil fields? As a result, the Biden Administration's goal of shifting to hydrogen or carbon capture for electricity generation to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions looks futile.</p><p> Debt Ceiling: Sooner Than Later</p><p>California has historically become a boom/bust state for tax collections, since approximately 3,000 people pay the vast majority of the state's taxes, especially from capital gains. As a result, California has gone from a surplus a couple of years ago to a big deficit nowadays.</p><p> Increasingly, the federal government has become more dependent on capital gains for tax revenue, but due to lackluster stock and real estate markets, it appears that the federal government's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/the-us-debt-ceiling-crisis-is-ultimate-gift-for-china/\">debt ceiling</url>  deadline may occur sooner than later.</p><p> Interestingly, the Biden Administration canceled a second meeting with congressional leaders last Friday to debate lifting the debt ceiling. Officially, this delay will allow the White House and congressional staff more time to prepare for negotiations over the budget cuts that the Republican-led House of Representatives is demanding.</p><p> If a deal is not reached by June 1 st, pension payments for federal retirees can be postponed and provide lawmakers more time to hammer out details. A partial government shutdown is also possible, which has happened in the past, but that is expected to be the last resort.</p><p> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Bloomberg interview said 'If Congress fails to do that, it really impairs our credit rating. We have to default on some obligation, whether it's Treasuries or payments to Social Security recipients.'</p><p> In Japan for a meeting of G7 finance ministers, Treasury Secretary Yellen said that the Biden Administration and congressional Republicans are making some progress in their budget negotiations. Specifically, Yellen said 'I'm hopeful. I think the negotiations are very active. I'm told they have found some areas of agreement.'</p><p> In the wake of a cancelation of a meeting with congressional leaders, the Biden Administration is now trying to put a good spin on the budget negotiations, so the U.S. does not embarrass itself on the world stage. Apparently, our elected leaders can be shamed into doing their jobs, especially on an international stage like the G7.</p><p> CATL's LFP Battery Patent Expires</p><p> The patent on China's CATL's iron-phosphate (LFP) battery has expired, so the big South Korean battery manufacturers, namely LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and SK On are all now developing LFP batteries that utilize no expensive cobalt, nickel or magnesium.</p><p> The advantage of LPF batteries is that they can be 100% charged, do not catch on fire and are cheaper. The disadvantage of LFP batteries is that they are heavier and lose range in cold climates.</p><p> Currently, LFP batteries are being used in cheaper electric vehicles (EVs) as well as energy storage (e.g., powerwalls). SK On so far has a head start on LFP batteries compared to its South Korean rivals. Since SK On has a big battery plant in Georgia to supply predominately Ford and VW Group, its LFP batteries could help make EVs more affordable.</p><p> Chinese consumers prefer LFP batteries and due to a glut of EVs in China, price wars have broken out, with BYD being the big winner. The other Chinese EV companies are now looking at exporting their EVs, since selling in China has become less profitable.</p><p> Longer-term, the threat of Chinese EVs with cheaper LFP batteries being exported to Europe and North America are expected to make domestic EV manufacturers nervous. Chinese EV sales rose 26% in the first quarter, while overall Chinese vehicle sales actually contracted 6.7%, so EVs now account for approximately 27% of China's domestic vehicle sales.</p><p> Influential Retail</p><p> On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will announce <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/a-shift-back-to-retail-earnings/\">retail</url> sales for April. The U.S. consumer remains the driving force behind U.S. economic growth. Typically, consumer spending picks up in the spring and summer months, but spending on higher-priced durable goods, like appliances have been waning.</p><p> Currently, economists are expecting a 0.7% increase in April retail sales. Coincidently, the Atlanta Fed will update its second-quarter GDP estimate after the April retail sales report, since it is so influential.</p><p> Coffee Beans: Great Gathering of Kyles</p><p> A city named Kyle in Texas is calling on namesakes from around the world to help it break a record... for the largest gathering of Kyles, pitting them against the current record holders - Ivan.

And on Sunday, February 23, a controlled burn of 40 acres in the Estell Manor Park at 189 State Route 50 will occur between 10 AM and 6 PM.</p><p>Both controlled burns will be conducted by the New Jersey State Forest Fire Service with assistance from the Atlantic County Division of Parks and Recreation.</p><p>Controlled burns are used to prevent forest fires by eliminating underbrush and leaf litter that can fuel fires. In addition, they serve to stimulate new forest growth. They are one of several measures the Division of Parks and Recreation employs to prevent fires.</p><p>Controlled burns are contingent upon weather conditions. The State Forest Fire Service requires three consecutive days without precipitation prior to conducting a controlled burn. Wind conditions and humidity must also be favorable.

Mrs. Francis Markell, regent of the chapter, presided and in an address paid a beautiful tribute of the flag. Judge Glenn H. Worthington, the principal speaker, delivered an interesting and instructive address on the Stamp Act and occurrences leading to it. After a few opening remarks, Clerk of the Court Eli G. Haugh read from the records the original order of the 12 \"Immortal\" judges in 1765, repudiating the English Stamp Act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A mountain forest fire, said to be spreading rapidly, was reported to be working its way toward Wolfsville at 1 o'clock this morning. It was stated that the home of Lewis Foltz and the Black Rock Hotel was being menaced by the close proximity of the flames at that hour. It was also stated that two fires in different localities had joined and that hundreds of acres of land had been burned over.</p><p>Probably the most thorough and unique building development ever attempted in this city is now under construction by the Nicodemus Ice Cream Company. This company has purchased a tract of land opposite the Fair grounds and plans to develop a number of homes on the site. The streets on the 19 acres have already been laid out and ten bungalows are now under construction, five of which are nearing completion. One of the streets has been called Maryland Avenue, which connects with another street named Virginia Avenue. In naming the streets, it was thought that some section of the city should have thoroughfares named after the States in the Union. The sale price of each home will be $3,500 and each will have five rooms and a bath. All have been equipped with furnaces, bath accommodations, running water and electric lights.</p><p>40 Years Ago</p><p>Nov. 24, 1982</p><p>The Frederick County Zoning Board of Appeals Tuesday night voted to allow a Food and Drug Administration official to open a dog obedience night school at Shookstown and Gambrill Park roads. Over the objections of neighbors, who fear added noise and traffic in the area, the board unanimously approved the zoning exception with the condition that Sandra K. Woods allow only patrons access to the 17-acre farm from U.S. 40.</p><p>A new program for Medicaid funding of nursing home patients dominated discussion at the Citizens Nursing Home board meeting Tuesday night. In the words of Thomas M. Fox, county comptroller and board member, the program \"withdraws nursing care and substitutes with administrative care.\"</p><p>(Editor's Note: The News-Post does not have access to archives from 50 years ago for August 1972 through March 1973. The \"50 Years Ago\" summary will return April 1, 2023.)</p><p>20 Years Ago</p><p>Nov. 24, 2002</p><p>The Rev. Gerald Hanberry and his wife, Pat, share a passion for third world countries. They say their separate stints in the Peace Corps several years ago fueled that passion, which has evolved into a mission to \"learn globally and act locally.\" That mission earned the Rev. Hanberry a generous grant from the Lilly Foundation to travel to Central America on a quest for answers. Those answers generated more complex questions and a recommitment to be a catalyst for change in Frederick County. The trip, said the Hanberrys, changed their lives.</p><p>Many Arlo Guthrie fans used to sport long locks and tie-dyed shirts or some type of gear with ethnic-looking prints. Friday night at the Weinberg Center, a number of fans looked like the folks most of them used to rebel against. Graying men and women with sport jackets and plaid shirts, this time, brought along their kids, many of whom looked like the old hippie rebels Arlo still resembles.</p><p>The saw-whet owl is the smallest owl east of the Mississippi River. Sightings are rare in Maryland. But in the fall of the year the tiny owls take flight as they migrate from northern territories to more hospitable environments where food is plentiful. \"Saw-whets are not residents (in Maryland). They're rare here except in the very northern part of Frederick and Washington counties,\" said Steve Huy of Middletown. Mr. Huy is one of the volunteers who run saw-whet owl banding stations in Maryland for Project Owlnet. There are four in the state, one near Bittinger in Garrett County, one at Adkin's Arboretum near Denton, and one on Assateague Island. The fourth is on South Mountain, near Middletown. Mr. Huy mans that station.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)

And there is little farmers can do beyond the steps they have already taken to try to keep the virus out.</p><p>Unlike past years, the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza found a way to survive through the heat of last summer, leading to a rise in cases reported in the fall.</p><p>The outbreak is already more widespread than the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015, but it hasn't proven as costly yet partly because the government and industry applied lessons learned eight years ago.</p><p>\"The past year has been devastating for the turkey industry as we experience, unequivocally, the worst HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) outbreak in the industry's history,\" National Turkey Federation spokeswoman Shelby Newman said.</p><p>In the current outbreak, 58.4 million birds have been slaughtered on more than 300 commercial farms in 47 states. That is because any time the virus is detected, the entire flock on that farm - which can number in the millions - must be killed to limit the spread of the disease. Only Hawaii, Louisiana and West Virginia have yet to report a case of bird flu. Iowa - the nation's biggest egg producer - leads the nation with nearly 16 million birds slaughtered.</p><p>In 2015, about 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered on more than 200 farms in 15 states.</p><p>That previous outbreak remains the most expensive animal health disaster in U.S. history. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion to deal with infected birds, clean up barns and compensate farmers. It cost the industry roughly $3 billion as farmers incurred additional costs and lost money when they didn't have any birds on their farms.</p><p>This bills continue to pile up this year as cases spread, and that includes the cost to consumers.</p><p>Egg prices shot up to $4.82 a dozen in January from $1.93 a year earlier, according to the latest government figures. That spike prompted calls for a price-gouging investigation although the industry maintains that the combination of bird flu and significantly higher feed, fuel and labor costs is what's driving prices so high.</p><p>The price for a pound of chicken breast was $4.32 in January. That's down slightly from last fall when the price peaked at $4.75, but it is up significantly from the year before when chicken breasts were selling for $3.73 per pound.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't track retail turkey prices the same way as part of its inflation data, but the Agriculture Department says the wholesale price of turkey went from $1.29 per pound last January just before the bird flu outbreak began to $1.72 per pound last month.</p><p>The number of birds slaughtered peaked last spring at almost 21 million in March, leaving farmers leery of what they must face in the months ahead. University of Georgia virus researcher David Stallknecht said there is some hope that this spring might not be quite as bad because turkeys and chickens may have developed some immunity to the virus.</p><p>The key problem with bird flu is that the highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through their droppings and nasal discharges. Despite the best efforts of farmers, it is hard to keep the virus out.</p><p>Farmers have gone to great lengths by requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitizing trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn. Some farms have even upgraded barn ventilation and installed laser systems to discourage wild birds from congregating.</p><p>\"We recommend all producers redouble their efforts to protect their birds through good biosecurity practices,\" said Lyndsay Cole, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service that's leading the government's response.</p><p>Farmers began following those steps after the 2015 outbreak, and this outbreak has only reinforced the need to tighten biosecurity.</p><p>\"America's egg farmers continue to double-down on biosecurity protocols to protect our flocks and maintain a stable egg supply. We are grateful that there has been little to no farm-to-farm spread in this current outbreak,\" said Oscar Garrison, senior vice president of food safety and regulatory affairs at the United Egg Producers trade group.</p><p>Poultry and egg producers, partnering with the government, are parsing this outbreak for new lessons in keeping birds healthy.</p><p>\"That's really the key - early detection. It's kind of like a forest fire - the earlier you detect it, the easier it is to contain and eradicate,\" National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said.</p><p>Officials say bird flu doesn't represent a significant threat to human health.

This ban, effective starting Saturday, August 20, includes all campfires at designated campground and picnic areas. Campers at State campgrounds and management areas, as well as State park patrons, will be permitted to use portable gas cooking stoves and grills, liquefied or bottled fuels, and propane/liquid-fueled lanterns in designated areas. These prevention measures are in place to reduce the threat of human-caused wildfires that can seriously threaten life and property. DEM will continue to monitor and evaluate conditions to determine when the ban can be lifted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rhode Island is in an extreme drought and is witnessing increased wildfires with joint fire response from communities. On Saturday, August 20, DEM's Forest Fire Program will increase fire restrictions to Planning Level Stage IV (PL4). This designation follows the National Fire Danger Rating System, which assesses the potential wildfire risk by considering burning conditions, wildfire activity, and the availability of firefighting resources.</p><p>Any outdoor fire is a potential source of wildfire. In 2022 alone, Rhode Island has experienced over 70 reported wildfires, with 42 acres of land burned. People should be cautious not to inadvertently spark a wildfire while cooking outdoors, kindling a campfire, or using fireworks. The following safety tips should be followed to minimize risk:</p><p>Charcoals used for cooking must be cold before being discarded</p><p>People who smoke should use ashtrays</p><p>People should check with their local fire department to obtain a permit to burn. Fire departments have the authority to deny permits when conditions are too dangerous</p><p>It is important that communities and individual homeowners understand the risks of wildfire and take appropriate steps to protect and maintain to mitigate the impacts of fire in its severity and rate of spread. By staying up to date on DFE's homeowner resources, conditions and exercising caution, we can all mitigate the risk of wildfires.</p><p>People are also reminded of Smokey Bear's basic rules of fire prevention:</p><p>Only you can prevent wildfires</p><p>Always be careful with fire</p><p>Never play with matches or lighters</p><p>Always watch your campfire</p><p>(If permitted) make sure your campfire is completely out before leaving it</p><p>Green bonds support what we all love about Rhode Island clean blue waters, green spaces, and vibrant communities. If approved by the voters, the proposed 2022 Green Bonds (Question 3) will invest in open space, outdoor recreation, land revitalization, green energy, climate resilience, forest, habitat, wildlife conservation, water quality, and new facilities at Roger Williams Park and Zoo. This includes $3M slated for forest health management and wildlife habitat projects at state management areas. Rhode Island's forests and trees may seem like a green backdrop to our landscape, but they are in fact hard at work generating a wide range of services and values. Forests are a place where humans and native wildlife can live and thrive by providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans. They also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion, purify our air, clean our water, and mitigate climate change.</p><p>Keep yourself informed by following Rhode Island Division of Forest Environment, Wildland Fire Control (DFE) for daily conditions updates.

Extinguishing wildfires demands a lot of specially trained firefighters to combat moving blazes over large patches of land. </p><p>\"For the exercise, we train so we are unified and know each others' strengths and equipment,\" said Bryan Palmer, lead fire warden with the Whiskey Run Regional Wildfire Crew and third assistant chief with the Iselin/West Lebanon Volunteer Fire Company. </p><p>\"Our sole purpose is to provide trained wildland firefighters,\" he said. \"As a team, we are more organized and better trained than the traditional firefighters.\" </p><p>The 87 volunteer firefighters still respond to automobile accidents and structure fires. </p><p>Palmer's group is based out of the Iselin/West Lebanon Volunteer Fire Company in Indiana County. All of the participating firefighters earned certifications in wildfire training. </p><p>The crew responded to 62 wildfires in the past two years, Palmer said. About 60 volunteers turn out for most wildfires, he noted. </p><p>The chief of the Iselin/West Lebanon company, Brian Schirato, noted the training for wildfires is more specialized than traditional training. Forest fire wardens with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources oversee the crew's work. </p><p>Having a dedicated wildfire crew is not just practical but necessary to douse wildfires quickly, officials said Sunday. </p><p>\"With people working during the week, it might take you hours to find people,\" said Ken Stobert, first assistant chief with the Kiski Township Volunteer Fire Department. \"Also, house fires stay there, wildfires don't.\" </p><p>Parks Township fire Chief Joel Brown Sr. added, \"It's nice to know, when you get on the radio, there will be somebody there to help you.\" </p><p>On Sunday, the firefighters lined up and with hoes and shovels, digging trenches to prevent the movement of a controlled brush fire. Pumper trucks moved in as groups of firefighters took their turn practicing extinguishing the small fires on a wooded hillside off Claypool Lane. </p><p>While the techniques to extinguish wildfires are traditional, innovations such as a drone equipped with heat sensors are used by the group. </p><p>\"It's our eye in the sky,\" said Jim Borkowski, a safety officer with Port Vue's fire department who is certified by the FAA to operate the drone.

According to news reporting originating from the University of Engineering and Management by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Wildfire-emitted aerosols could have a huge impact on global climate by disrupting the global radiation balance. The Community Earth Model Of the system with regulated daily smoke aerosol releases is used in this work to evaluate the effects of fire aerosols on global climate, with a focus on climate feedbacks.\"</p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Engineering and Management: \"The total wildfire aerosol thermal influence (RE) is predicted for being 20.78 6 0.29 W m22, with shortwave RE (REaci; 20.70 6 0.20 W m22) accounting for the majority of the RE. The annual global warming shift DT is 20.64 6 0.16 K, with northern hemisphere experiencing the highest change. In the Arctic, where the shortwave REaci is strong, there is a decline. The build-up of Arctic Sea ice is associated to the cooling, which acts to amplify the Arctic cooling through positive ice-albedo feedback. The quick reaction (irrelevant to DT) tends to lower surface latent heat flow into the atmosphere in the tropics to counter compelling smoke black carbon absorbing, which decreases rainfall in tropical land regions (southern Africa and South America). Climate feedback processes (pertaining to DT) result in a significant reduction in surface latent heat flux over global ocean areas, which could account for the vast majority (;80%) of global precipitation reduction.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Precipitate is formed in deep tropical latitudes (58N), but rises in the tropical ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, owing to a southern displacement of the inter - tropical convergence transitional zone and a lowering of the Hadley system in the Southern Hemisphere. Through intensifying cross-equator atmospheric heat transport, such changes could partially compensate for the interhemispheric temperature asymmetry induced by boreal forest fire aerosol indirect effects. This paper deals with wildfire aerosols' impact on forest biomass, the global energy budget, and climate, as well as ways to replenish them.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Environmental inferno- Wildfire emitted aerosols. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American Journal of Applied Bio-Technology Research</emphasis>, 2022,3(2).

The exhibit, spanning a variety of mediums, will showcase the power of artists who are inspiring hope and action in their artwork to address the climate crisis, and spotlight the disproportionate burden climate impacts have on women. HOW ON EARTH will be accompanied by a series of free, public programming highlighting local Chicago artists grappling with environmental issues in their own practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As we celebrate 10 years of EXPO CHICAGO and serving as one of its original special exhibition partners, we wanted an opportunity to celebrate the transformational power artists play in the climate movement,\" said Elizabeth Corr, Associate Director of Arts and Cultural Partnerships at NRDC. \"Each of our featured artists has a unique approach to driving social change through their workmirroring how each of us can support climate justice.\"</p><p>Through this curatorial partnership with ATLT, the exhibit will transform the common dystopian portrayal of the climate crisiscentering women's perspectives and art as a key driver of action and hope.</p><p>\"If we want to move forward in addressing and solving issues regarding environmental justice, we need great artists who are ahead of the current thinking,\" said Anne Verhallen, Co-Founder of ATLT. \"Collaborating with advocates as well respected as NRDC helps us bring artists to the forefront of the national conversation on climate change.\"</p><p>\"We are embattled in an existential fight against climate collapse, and my home state of California is quite literally on fire,\" said Kwong, whose installation MOTHERFIRE will display 55 Shou Sugi Ban posts, representing devastated forests and sprouting regenerative plants. \"My commitment to serve the environment through artistic expression, explore a spiritual connection to nature and share the wisdom of plant life only deepens as our mighty forests fight for their lives.\"</p><p>In addition to the in-booth exhibit, Ma will also create a large-scale, interactive tidal wave installation using traditional Chinese paper cutting techniques. The changing condition of decay of the paper over the course of the fair underscores the dire situation of the environment that hangs in the balance. The installation, located at the entrance to the fair, will serve as the backdrop for EXPO CHICAGO's live events and performances spotlighting local talent.</p><p>\"Art plays an important role in affecting social change by challenging the viewer to learn about an issue and hopefully inspire them to participate in action,\" said Tony Karman, President and Director of EXPO CHICAGO. \"We are deeply proud of our legacy of collaboration with NRDC as thousands of patrons continue to experience the evolving interconnectedness between art and the climate movement.\"</p><p>To learn more, visit NRDC and ATLT at booth 132 in Navy Pier's Festival Hall from April 13 to 16 and attend our programming the 21c Museum Hotel. Full programming schedule and registration details available here.</p><p>Collaborating Artists and Work</p><p>Janet Biggs (New York City) is a research-based, interdisciplinary artist known for her immersive pieces in video, film and performance. Biggs' work focuses on individuals in extreme landscapes or situations, navigating the territory between art, science and technology. Biggs' harrowing video, Weighing Life Without a Scale, 2018, which emphasizes the importance of acting upon climate change, contrasts migration taking place at a refugee camp in Djibouti with high tech plans for escape to Mars.</p><p>Lily Kwong (Los Angeles) works at the intersection of horticulture, urban design, contemporary art, fashion and wellnessfocusing on reconnecting people to nature through transformative landscape projects and botanical art installations. Kwong's MOTHERFIRE features 55 Shou Sugi Ban posts with saplings inspired by regrowth at the site of the August Complex Fire of 2020, California's largest forest fire.</p><p>Helina Metaferia (New York City) is an interdisciplinary artist working across collage, assemblage, video, performance and social engagement. Her work integrates archives, somatic studies, and dialogical practices to elevate overlooked narratives from marginalized groups. In Metafaria's Headress 55 and Headress 56, a pair of crowned heroines represent the power of women to enact change.</p><p>Jennifer Wen Ma (Beijing, New York City) is a visual artist whose interdisciplinary practice bridges media such as installation, drawing, video, public art, design and performance. Ma's piece, Turn of the Tide, highlights ocean pollution and the threat of sea level rise due to climate change.</p><p>NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists.

In a more complex, competitive and unpredictable world, working together to promote our shared values of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the rules based international order and to pursue our common interests is more important than ever. We stand firmly together in the pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity in the world including in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p><p>Our steadily deepening partnership makes us stronger and more resilient, delivering clear benefits to our people by generating sustainable economic growth and creating jobs. Cooperation between Canada and the European Union can help make life more affordable and create good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. Our common values and principles are why we are positioned to grow circular, nature positive and climate-neutral economies across Canada and Europe that are competitive, inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all, and why we are able to work together to fight the triple crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to protect people from its worst impacts. We are putting people first as we do this making sure households are better off as we build a prosperous climate neutral economy.</p><p>We emphasize the fundamental role that the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) and the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) have played in strengthening our relationship in the seven years since they were signed. We remain strongly committed to ensuring their full and effective implementation and their ratification, and commit to further expanding our cooperation under these agreements.</p><p>Today we are pleased to announce significant new areas of cooperation. The establishment of a Green Alliance will deepen our already close cooperation on climate action and shared work to grow sustainable, competitive economies with good jobs. A Digital Partnership will strengthen our engagement on digital transformation and governance in a rapidly changing world. Substantive negotiations of an agreement on Canada's participation in the EU's Horizon Europe programme are now completed, and both sides are working towards its prompt signature and implementation. The agreement will further strengthen the cooperation of our science communities in addressing global challenges.</p><p>Global Priorities</p><p>Our support to Ukraine is steadfast. We share an unequivocal condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression and our unwavering commitment to Ukraine including a just and sustainable peace based on international law, Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. We will continue our intensified diplomatic outreach efforts and cooperation with Ukraine and other countries to ensure the widest possible international support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace and the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula, with a view to a Global Peace Summit being held. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, will work to address Ukraine's immediate military and defence needs and ensure Ukraine has the long-term security commitments needed, while it pursues its Euro-Atlantic integration. We will do so in full respect of the security and defence policy of certain EU Member States and taking into account the security and defence interests of all EU Member States, the EU and Canada. We will work together to support Ukraine's sustainable security, and will continue providing military, humanitarian, economic and financial support, and facilitate trade, private investment, and will prioritize recovery and reconstruction. We welcome the informal coordination between Canada and the EU's training missions, Operations UNIFIER and EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), conducting critical training of the Ukrainian military. Canada and the EU alongside other G7 Members, will continue to work through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform on ensuring a robust response to Ukraine's reconstruction needs. To further strengthen this collaboration, Canada intends to deploy a secondee to the Platform's Secretariat in the near future. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and substantial efforts to meet the required conditions in its EU accession process. We encourage Ukraine to continue on its path of reforms. We will continue to work together to support Ukraine's security, defence and resilience on one hand, and reconstruction and reforms on the other, thus creating conditions to mobilise private investment. The EU and Canada will continue cooperating to deliver concrete solutions in support of Ukraine's agriculture and agri-food sector which could include facilitating exports of grain and agricultural products from Ukraine to third countries including those most in need. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path.</p><p>Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. The EU and Canada call for work to continue, including in the Core Group, on efforts to establish a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine that would enjoy the broadest cross-regional support and legitimacy, and towards the establishment of a future compensation mechanism. Canada and the EU recognise that decisive progress is needed, in coordination with partners, on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction, consistent with applicable contractual obligations, and in accordance with EU and international law.</p><p>We recognize the value and the growing importance of our cooperation on restrictive measures. In particular, we will continue to impose extensive sanctions targeting Russia, as well as stringent export control restrictions and prohibitions. Moreover, we are committed to further strengthening our cooperation and coordination on broader sanctions actions, including disrupting circumvention, in support of our policy objectives.</p><p>We unequivocally condemn Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel on October 7. We support Israel's right to defend itself, in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and welcome the recent agreement to liberate hostages and to allow for an extended humanitarian pause to permit the delivery of essential supplies. We underscore that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations.</p><p>We are gravely concerned about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and welcome the adoption of resolution 2712 by the United Nations (UN) Security Council, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip. We reaffirm the imperative to protect civilians and ensure full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law. We strongly reiterate the importance of urgent and unimpeded access for life saving humanitarian aid flowing to Gaza through all necessary measures, including humanitarian corridors and pauses. We have contributed significant funding for humanitarian assistance and remain committed to addressing urgent humanitarian needs.</p><p>We remain committed to the goal of comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East, and re-iterate our belief in the renewed importance of progress towards a two-state solution on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions through reinvigorated efforts in the peace process. We stand ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution, with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign, and viable Palestinian State, living side-by-side in peace and security and mutual recognition. We remain opposed to any forced displacement of Palestinians. We condemn all forms of intolerance and discrimination, on the basis of religion, belief or origin and remain firmly committed to combatting all forms of hatred.</p><p>We express deep concerns with Iran's nuclear escalation and its refusal to meaningfully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and its persistent failure to implement Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) commitments. We wholly support the IAEA's mission of continued verification and monitoring in Iran. A diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue remains the best way to address international concerns. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon.</p><p>We are prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, including through cooperation on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, debt sustainability, global health and pandemic preparedness. China is an important trade and economic partner and we will seek to ensure a level playing field and a balanced, reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship. We will continue to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in its supply chains, and will de-risk and diversify where necessary and appropriate. We do not intend to decouple or to turn inwards. The East and South China Seas are of strategic importance for regional and global prosperity and security. We remain seriously concerned about growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in Canada's or the European Union's One China policy. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang. With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.</p><p>We recognize the critical challenges faced by our countries and by our global partners, from climate impacts and food insecurity to ensuring a just transition, good governance, rule of law, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work together with partners from around the world to address these challenges, including in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. In the Pacific Islands, we will reinforce our support, including to advance their priorities in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms. We agree on the importance of a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic.</p><p>We reaffirm our commitment to coordinate our actions in the Sahel region, alongside international and regional organizations. We support L'Academie Internationale de Lutte Contre le Terrorisme in Cote d'Ivoire in responding to evolving terrorist threats and violent extremism. We will work together in supporting the people of Haiti in their efforts to build a more resilient and equitable future, including by fighting impunity and corruption, restoring security and stability and creating the necessary conditions for holding democratic elections.</p><p>Sustainable economic growth for all</p><p>The Canada-EU economic relationship, underpinned by CETA, has contributed to delivering prosperity for our economies during a period of global uncertainty. Now in the seventh year of provisional application, CETA's benefits to workers, exporters and our economies are clear: in 2022, bilateral trade in goods was significantly higher than pre-CETA levels in 2016. Through a single set of high standard rules, businesses and workers in Canada and the EU are benefitting from a more predictable, transparent and accessible business environment. Canada and the EU will continue to use the mechanisms established by CETA to cooperate towards building resilient and diversified supply chains. We will continue work to ensure the full implementation of CETA, and to sustainably strengthen Canada-EU trade, including for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs. Canada and the EU acknowledge the important role CETA can play in driving sustainable development and moving towards a climate neutral economy. We welcome related investments and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.</p><p>Canada and the EU intend to focus on the negotiations toward a renewed competition cooperation agreement that would drive deeper cooperation and coordination possibilities between our respective competition agencies, providing a legal framework to coordinate enforcement activities and share information obtained through investigative powers in full respect of data privacy guarantees.</p><p>Canada is well-positioned to contribute to Europe's energy security and energy transition. The Canada-EU High Level Energy Dialogue will continue facilitating action on all energy-related matters, including proceeding with the EU becoming a member of the Equal by 30 Campaign, led by Canada, which is working towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the energy sector by 2030 and launching a new European Commission Canada Roadmap on Methane Emissions. We are laying the foundation for reliable hydrogen supply chains and common approaches to standards and certification, which will accelerate commercialization and increase transatlantic trade.</p><p>To secure reliable and sustainable supply chains and competitive economic growth, Canada and the EU continue to advance shared work on critical minerals, including through the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials. Critical minerals are essential for the transition towards climate-neutrality of our economies, and we will continue to support integrated, secure and diversified supply chain development, science, technology and innovation cooperation, and enhance global environmental, social and governance criteria and standards. This will include joint efforts to engage and connect our respective businesses to accelerate two-way trade and investment that can help develop new supply sources for critical minerals. Canada and the EU agree that secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials enabling the green and digital transition is emerging as a shared challenge for the global community and will continue discussing how participation in the EU-proposed Critical Raw Materials Club would complement and strengthen ongoing initiatives to jointly address that challenge.</p><p>Economic security is a growing concern for governments around the world, and cooperation with partners and engagement with stakeholders will assist with better policy-making. To support this, Canada and the EU will launch a Canada-EU dialogue on economic security to exchange information on trends and risks of mutual concern which could affect our economic security and developments with regards to possible policy responses.</p><p>Combatting climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution</p><p>With today's establishment of a Canada-EU Green Alliance, Canada and the EU continue to deepen our partnership on fighting climate change, protecting the environment and ocean, halting and reversing biodiversity loss and growing a strong, prosperous future. Recognising the key role of both Canada and the EU in leading global efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to foster a circular nature-positive and global climate neutral economy by 2050, the Alliance is a testament to the depth and breadth of our shared ambition. Building on our extensive existing cooperation, the Alliance aims to take our partnership to the next level by further intensifying our political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate action, environmental and ocean protection, energy transition, green industrial transformation, regulatory and business cooperation, research and innovation, climate finance, sustainable finance and biodiversity finance and cooperation at the multilateral level and supporting the climate-neutral transitions of third countries.</p><p>Recent natural disasters and extreme weather events have devastated communities in Canada and Europe alike. Canada is grateful for the support provided through the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism during the most significant forest fire season on record in Canada. We welcome the signature of an administrative arrangement to improve the sharing of information and best practices on how to respond to emergencies. Canada is pleased to facilitate the export of Canadian-built fire-fighting aircraft to bolster the EU's and Member States' fleets.</p><p>We recognize that even more ambitious action is required to mitigate and build resilience to climate change, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and ensuring a credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the upcoming 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we will work together to promote decisive global action to tackle the climate crisis and to set the direction for future global climate efforts on the basis of the Global Stock Take recommendations. We will work together to accelerate the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels no later than 2050 and end the construction of new coal-fired power generation in a manner consistent with the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Recognizing the importance of increasing energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy, we will work towards the full and effective implementation of the Global Energy Pledge to collectively double the rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030 and to triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 to 11 Terawatts, while respecting each country's national energy mix. We will also work to support the most vulnerable countries, including by delivering on climate finance commitments, calling on contributors to raise their ambition, and establishing funding arrangements on loss and damage. We will continue to convene the Ministerial on Climate Action with China, and will continue to lead global action on short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, under the Global Methane Pledge, the Global Methane Initiative, the International Methane Emissions Observatory and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</p><p>We will lead the way to mobilise partners around the world for the signature, ratification and effective implementation of the High Seas Treaty and for the swift and full implementation of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF), agreed to in Montreal. To this end, we will work together to develop ambitious nature-positive policies, mainstreaming biodiversity into all sectors. We share the objective to prevent global deforestation, and we intend to work together and with others to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, including as they relate to global supply chains, while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. We will also cooperate towards substantially and progressively increasing the mobilisation of financial resources to support international biodiversity objectives, in line with the goals and the targets of the KMGBF.</p><p>We recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to spur related investment and innovation in the interest of the people's health and well-being. In that regard, Canada and the EU reaffirm their support for the Call to Action for Paris Aligned Carbon Markets, launched at the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact. Canada welcomes the EU as the most recent Partner to join the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge to expand the use of carbon pricing globally by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. Canada and the EU commit to continue exchanges on their carbon pricing systems and working closely on measures to address carbon leakage risks in a non-discriminatory manner including on next steps for cooperation on the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We will also address emissions intensity of the steel and aluminium manufacturing industries and advance manufacturing, re-manufacturing and recycling of steel and aluminium, both at home and abroad, and will continue cooperating closely in bilateral and multilateral fora.</p><p>We are committed to ending plastic pollution by 2040 and will work together, including through the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, to develop a dedicated ambitious and effective international legally binding instrument.</p><p>Through the Canada-EU Ocean Partnership, we are increasing cooperation on ocean governance, conservation, science, and sustainable use. In this context, we welcome the first Ocean Partnership Forum that took place in October 2022, and look forward to the next Forum planned for 2025. We will work together to achieve an ambitious Our Ocean Conference in Greece in 2024 and UN Ocean Conference in Nice in 2025.</p><p>Research and innovation cooperation and responsible digital innovation</p><p>We reaffirm our support for collaborative partnerships between our science research communities. Today, we are pleased to announce the completion of substantive negotiations on Canada's association to Pillar II of Horizon Europe, which once signed and implemented will provide new opportunities for international science partnerships on global challenges.</p><p>As strategic partners in emerging technologies and cutting-edge research, we will contribute solutions to global challenges and provide new economic opportunities. We are launching the Canada-EU Digital Partnership, which will allow us to deepen our engagement on areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), online platform governance and accountability, and quantum technologies, secure international connectivity and cyber security, digital skills and digital credentials and digital identities.</p><p>Canada and the EU share an interest in fostering safer, more inclusive digital environments. To this end, the Canada-EU Digital Partnership will be an important forum to collaborate on efforts to advance the accountability of online platforms such as social media and online marketplaces in a way that enhances the respect for all human rights online. We are committed to holding online platforms accountable to mitigate the negative effects of content on their services on systemic societal risks, including gender-based violence, notably by giving their users tools and resources to protect themselves, and by mandating significantly more transparency for our societies over online content moderation.</p><p>Canada and the EU have a longstanding collaboration in advancing responsible design, development and use of AI, including through key multilateral forums like the G7, through the Hiroshima AI Process, and the Global Partnership on AI, where both are founding members. Canada and the EU are also among the most advanced jurisdictions in the world regarding the regulation of AI technologies. We are committed to working together on the global governance of digital and other emerging technologies, like AI, rooted in a risk-based approach, the protection of safety and respect for human rights and the rules-based international order, supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms. In support of this, we will collaborate to ensure applicable regulatory measures. As we continue our respective work on AI governance and regulatory frameworks, we commit to work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to share information and strive for solutions to facilitate the interoperability of our domestic approaches, helping to ensure AI actors in Canada and Europe have the greatest possible access to international markets to advance the safe, secure and trustworthy commercialization of this technology.</p><p>We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. To this end, we will cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards levels to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyber incidents. We will also strengthen collaboration in upholding international norms of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, notably through the UN with the establishment of a Program of Action for cybersecurity and joint diplomatic responses to counter malicious behaviour. We will also seek opportunities to enhance cooperation and coordination on cyber capacity building efforts and exchange information on regulatory measures.</p><p>Further to the G7 Action Plan for Building a Secure and Resilient Digital Infrastructure, Canada and the EU intend to support secure international connectivity and explore possible new routes of international communication infrastructure to strengthen network resilience.</p><p>We recognize the transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing economic growth and sustainability, and the need to ensure that they respect human rights and democracy. We aim to ensure Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) in compliance with relevant rules in the respective jurisdictions, including data protection rules. We also welcome the EU Canada close cooperation on the EU's adequacy decision to ensure its continuity.</p><p>Advancing international peace and security</p><p>We welcome increased Canada-EU cooperation on security and defence, including the upcoming administrative arrangement which confirms Canada's participation in the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation Project on network of logistics hubs. We will seek to further deepen our cooperation through enhancing our security and defence dialogue, identifying opportunities for joint naval activities and strengthened collaboration on cyber security and the climatesecurity nexus. We reaffirm the importance of further strengthening and deepening the mutually reinforcing and beneficial EU-NATO partnership, while fully respecting the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity, transparency and decision-making autonomy. We will advance the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and meaningful participation of women and youth in prevention, mediation and resolution, in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.</p><p>In support of our joint efforts in combatting terrorism and serious transnational crime, we welcome the finalisation of the negotiations that pave the way for the conclusion of a new Canada-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data Agreement. This Agreement will provide a solid basis for the transfer and use of PNR data and ensure the capacity to effectively and efficiently prevent and fight terrorism and serious transnational crime while upholding privacy protections and protecting human rights.</p><p>Promoting Shared Values and the Rules-Based International Order</p><p>Democracy, human rights, gender equality and the rule of law remain universal principles that guide international action for both Canada and the EU. We are concerned with the ongoing backlash against gender equality and the rights of women, girls and LGBTI persons, including increased incidents of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence that is amplified by the use of technology. We will continue to call for respect for the rights of all women and girls, not only in Afghanistan and Iran, but around the world. We reaffirm our commitment to take concerted and collective action against arbitrary detention and to work closely to anchor its principles in the international legal and normative framework, as well as to promote the biennial UN General Assembly Resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty. In 2023, Canadian observers have participated in EU election observation missions in Guatemala, Liberia, Maldives, Paraguay, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, and Canada will continue to work alongside the EU in electoral observation and the support of democratic principles and values.</p><p>We will continue to strengthen our collaboration to counter foreign threats to democracy, including through platforms like the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. We will continue to work together to protect information integrity grounded in inclusion, human rights and the rule of law with the objective of defending against and increasing citizen and societal resilience to information manipulation and disinformation both online and offline, including through working on the development of international norms and principles, such as those in the Global Declaration on Information Integrity Online. We call on all foreign actors to cease and to refrain from interference activities, aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and processes and our economic prosperity. We will continue to work together on digital justice, and, in this context, welcome the first EU-Canada informal senior-level dialogue on justice issues, held in May 2022.</p><p>The EU and Canada will make resolute efforts to uphold the rules-based international order with the UN at its core. We will strive for a well-functioning, reformed multilateral system, with an effective and sustainably funded UN. We will endeavour to work towards an effective, inclusive and networked multilateral system that is capable of facing new global realities and remain true to the rules and principles of the UN Charter. We are committed to working together with all partners to reinforce and reform global governance in line with 'Our Common Agenda'. We are determined to seize the opportunities represented by the 2024 Summit of the Future and the 2025 World Social Summit to develop a system that is resilient and as relevant today as when it was created.</p><p>We are committed to cooperate to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to tackle modern day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024, including with respect to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system.</p><p>Canada and the EU agree to explore the possibility of establishing a new dialogue on humanitarian issues under the SPA. We will work to address priorities of the global community, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) both at home and abroad, including mobilising finances to close the SDG financing gap. In particular, we will also focus on delivering better, bigger and more effective Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact. We will also sustain our support to the necessary reforms to the multilateral system and its development banks, and financing for global public goods such as climate, biodiversity, or pandemic prevention, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and shared prosperity, in line with the SDGs. We will also seek to prevent fragmentation through the transformation of the governance of the international financial architecture to make it more effective, transparent and accountable. We will contribute to strengthening global health security to better prevent, prepare and respond to current and future health emergencies, including by jointly promoting shared priorities for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of an effective, ambitious and legally binding new pandemic agreement, and the targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, by May 2024. We also support the Pandemic Fund. We welcome plans for the first Canada-EU Health Policy Dialogue under the SPA, scheduled for early 2024. Global hunger has been rising since 2015 and has been intensified by rising food and energy insecurity. We stand ready to continue contributing to the global fertilizers production and value chains in order to ensure food security, decreasing dependency on Russian and Belarusian production.</p><p>We have also agreed to deepen our partnership in support of high-quality global infrastructure development, in line with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment and EU Global Gateway initiative's common objectives.</p><p>We recognize the importance of sustainable, resilient and quality infrastructure throughout the world. We are committed to working together towards the joint G7 aim of mobilizing $600 billion in financing through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the EU Global Gateway initiative. Under these initiatives, we welcome our collaboration in support of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships with South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal, including under the Great Green Wall initiative. We will continue our close cooperation on the Kiwa Initiative, a multi-donor program that aims to strengthen climate change resilience in the Pacific Islands through nature-based solutions. FinDev Canada will continue to partner with EU-based development finance institutions to advance sustainable infrastructure solutions in support of positive development, climate and nature outcomes.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Canada and the EU are committed to addressing today's global challenges, including economic uncertainty, climate change, biodiversity loss, digital transformation, natural disasters and regional instabilities. Canada and the EU will be guided by our common commitment to democratic values, the rule of law, human rights, sustainability and an inclusive, multilateral, and rules-based international system. We will continue to work together in safeguarding our shared values, addressing common challenges, embracing the new opportunities of a rapidly changing world and strengthening the dynamic EU-Canada people-to-people contacts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126260324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RD-M391-JCBF-S0G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 27, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Twenty-one people died. File Photo by Prakash Elamakkara/EPA-EFE</p><p>Monday's crash in China, however, involved a Boeing 737-800 model, not a Max.

Investigators later blamed the crash on the pilot.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UPI-7341647852123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UPI2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6521-2531-JBT2-3084-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8076</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"372\"/><timeReceived>5:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 U.P.I.

With only three paid employees in a town of 503 people, the residents take care of each other and the town's resources, and they pride themselves in their volunteerism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So when it became clear that the town's lake was suffering from sedimentation and overgrown vegetation, residents wanted to clean the lake themselves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But to do that, they need permits and permission from state agencies \u2014 a process the town's residents are already frustrated with.</p><p>\"This little town is usually pretty immaculate because of people volunteering. They're dying to get to that pond and clean it up and they would do it in a safe and effective way, but unfortunately because of fish and game laws and this and that, we're not even allowed to touch what I consider our own property,\" said Ryderwood resident Linda Munson at an Oct. 21 meeting with Ryderwood stakeholders, including Cowlitz County officials, foresters with nearby landowner Sierra Pacific Industries and a Department of Natural Resources (DNR) representative, to discuss how to initiate a project intended to return the lake to its former glory.</p><p>Ryderwood's management, the Ryderwood Improvement and Service Association (RISA), is seeking permission and resources to dredge the southern portion of the lake and to reduce future sedimentation by rerouting nearby Campbell Creek into the lake.</p><p>The townspeople created Ryderwood Lake, also known as Ryderwood Pond, in 1956 after receiving permission from the state to construct a dam on nearby Dixon Creek with the intent of turning a gravel pit in town into a fishing lake for Ryderwood's residents.</p><p>At its prime, Ryderwood Pond was 6 acres in size with depths ranging from 7 feet deep on one end to 4 feet deep on the other.</p><p>A floating boathouse in the north end allowed residents to take rowboats out onto the lake, and many use the lake as a fishing spot.</p><p>But over the years, sedimentation and overgrown vegetation have overtaken much of the lake.</p><p>\"I like to fish, that's one of the reasons why I moved out here,\" said Munson, \"and every place that I went out to on that pond, my line was less than 3 feet in the water and I came out with nothing but sludge.\"</p><p>Residents do still use the beloved lake as a recreation site. Bill Greear, one of Ryderwood's few lifelong residents, said he still takes his kayak out into the deeper sections of the lake, and many residents frequent a walking trail around the lake and attempt to fish.</p><p>But many are frustrated as they watch the lake become increasingly shallow and overgrown without the ability to do anything about it.</p><p>\"This is nature's beauty, but unfortunately it's got a bit of a blemish,\" said Munson.</p><p>Aside from the diminished scenic and recreational value of the lake, the residents are concerned that the lower water levels would hinder firefighting efforts in the event of a major forest fire.</p><p>\"What the lake would be useful for is in a wild forest fire sort of situation,\" said Patrick Harbison, utilities manager for Cowlitz County, who was asked to speak at the Oct. 21 meeting.</p><p>\"If a forest fire shows up, opening up hydrants with hoses is only going to last hours. It's going to protect the town long enough to get you out of town. The residents are requesting enough access to the lake to actually try and protect the town so they don't become Paradise California.\"</p><p>Paradise, a rural foothill town in Northern California, was virtually destroyed in the Camp Fire in 2018.</p><p>While there admittedly isn't much water in Ryderwood Lake, Jeff Bortner, the fire operations district manager for DNR's Pacific Cascade Region, told Ryderwood residents that firefighters are able to work with much less.</p><p>\"The lake as it currently is, we could utilize it,\" said Bortner. \"If it's a drought year and we have to go somewhere else for water, we will; but we're pretty good at finding water when we need it.\"</p><p>DNR is able to transport water via tenders if needed, but Bortner said natural water sources are pretty easy to find in Southwestern Washington.</p><p>\"There's normally some water somewhere, and we're very good at going to fires in places that have much less water and finding it too, somehow, whether it's trucking it in from the nearest hydrant or finding a lake, pond or a river. We do that quite often,\" said Bortner.</p><p>Even so, Ryderwood's residents are determined to clean and restore the lake.</p><p>\"The big concern right now is the water. We've got to have that water,\" said Munson. \"We know for a fact that water is not very deep anymore and that has got to be cleaned up. We would do it ourselves if somebody would just let us have the equipment.\"</p><p>Harbison said he sympathized with the residents' frustration with the permitting process.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, it's a fact of life for us in Washington,\" he said. \"If the county could give you permission to get in there, I almost guarantee they would, but it's really the state agencies that permission would need to come down from.\"</p><p>The first step in that project would be to do a feasibility study to determine what permits would be needed and how much each part of the project would cost. But a feasibility study takes time and money that neither Ryderwood or Cowlitz County have right now.</p><p>\"It's not a short process and it's not a cheap process, that's the problem as I see it,\" said Harbison.</p><p>Until the town can secure a state agency or another organization to serve as a project manager, it's RISA's responsibility to seek funding and complete a feasibility study.</p><p>Cowlitz County Commissioner Arne Mortenson recommended that the town make a firm decision on its priorities regarding the lake and build a plan from there.</p><p>\"You can imagine you're not the only community to say we need help,\" said Mortenson, \"You've got to decide what is important to you ... I've heard you want it all, and that is really hard to do.\"</p><p>While Cowlitz County has not agreed to manage the project, Harbison said he would speak to his supervisor and come up with ideas for other options RISA can pursue to get their project moving.</p><p>\"Cowlitz County at this second is not in the position to manage it but there are options that I've seen small organizations do to manage something similar to this and we can go from there,\" said Harbison.</p><p>___ (c)2021 The Chronicle (Centralia, Wash.)

Since the start of this year's fire season, there have been over 330 wildfires, only one of which was caused by a natural lightning strike. These fires, intensified by high winds and dry conditions, have consumed almost 900 acres of land.</p><p>\"The vast majority of wildland fires are started because of human actions, such as a poorly extinguished campfire, which can threaten the public's forests and parks and endanger public safety and infrastructure,\" said Acting DCR Commissioner Stephanie Cooper. \"That is why it is so important that we all are aware of the elevated risks of a fire when the weather is especially dry and remain diligent in practicing fire prevention methods.\"</p><p>DCR employs a three-pronged approach in conjunction with municipal fire departments with fire management concentrating on detection, suppression, and prevention. Detection begins with spotting wildfires through the agency's network of 42 active fire towers across Massachusetts. Suppression involves putting out wildfires on the ground alongside local fire departments. Prevention focuses on reducing fire fuels, including dried and dead leaves, branches, and pine needles, through prescribed fires, as well as educating the public of prevention methods through various programs like Smokey Bear.</p><p>\"Massachusetts typical spring fire season has been active recently, which has been exacerbated by the high frequency of windy conditions and low humidity, leading to increased fire activity and larger fire growth,\" said DCR Chief Fire Warden Dave Celino. \"Under these conditions, it's important that we ensure fires are managed safely and extinguished completely to prevent future wildfires.\"</p><p>Dry conditions increase the threat of brush and wildland fires. DCR urges residents to be aware of dry conditions and exercise caution when using charcoal grills, matches and other open flames during outdoor activities, and to ensure that fires are properly and completely extinguished. Below are some helpful campfire tips:</p><p>Before setting up a campfire, be sure it is permitted by checking with your local fire department;</p><p>Clear away dry leaves and sticks and overhanging low branches and shrubs;</p><p>Avoid burning on windy, dry days;</p><p>Attend to the campfire at all times;</p><p>Keep campfires small so they are easier to control;</p><p>Never use gasoline or other flammable or combustible liquids;</p><p>Always have a hose, bucket of water, or shovel and dirt or sand nearby to put out the fire.</p><p>Make sure your campfire is out cold before leaving.</p><p>To learn more about DCR's wildland fire suppression efforts, programs and strategies visit the agency's Forest Fire Control Program webpage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125214645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65FG-C8B1-JCBF-S114-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 13, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX567</classCode><className>BOSTON, MA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS137</classCode><className>MASSACHUSETTS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
