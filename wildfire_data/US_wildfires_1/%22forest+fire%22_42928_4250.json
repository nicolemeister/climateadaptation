This grant is funded by the U.S. Department of State and supported in its implementation by World Learning. Central provided a third of the funding for the exploration of these faculty-led off-campus experiences.</p><p>Four interdisciplinary teams of Central faculty explored different countries with the goal of developing a sustainable structure for faculty-led study abroad offerings that appeal to a diverse student body. Teams went to Chile, Greece, Iceland and Trinidad and Tobago.</p><p>The Chile team included Kathy Korcheck, professor of Spanish, Paulina Mena, professor of biology, and Oscar Reynaga, senior lecturer of Spanish, who traveled to Santiago, Valparaiso, and Vina del Mar, Chile. The highlight of their trip was meeting with faculty and administrators at two universities, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso and Universidad Nacional Andres Bello. At PUCV, the Central team presented to faculty and administrators about inclusive teaching practices, faculty development related to diversity and inclusion and Student Support Services at Central. At UNAB, they met with the kinesiology faculty and toured the simulation hospital on campus.</p><p>The team's proposed course will introduce students to contemporary Chile through an examination of the country's recent evolution from dictatorship to democracy and its efforts to create a more just, sustainable, inclusive and equitable society for all.</p><p>Stavros Papakonstantinidis, associate professor of communication studies, Nicole Palenske Ladner, associate professor of biology, Anna Christensen, assistant professor of philosophy, and Elena Vishnevskaya, associate professor of religion, explored Greece's history and culture.</p><p>The team's interdisciplinary focus will offer students a deeper understanding of the profound connections between history, archeology, philosophy, religion, gastronomy and current affairs. An introduction to the rich heritage of Greece will help students learn more about the world and themselves, thus enriching their individual journeys toward the life of an engaged citizen.</p><p>The Iceland team with Anya Butt, professor of biology, and Mary Donato, lecturer of communication studies, explored the breathtaking volcanoes, waterfalls and glaciers, as well as the bustling capital, Reykjavik. Butt and Donato look forward to exploring the Land of Fire and Ice with Central students. In addition to learning about Iceland's natural wonders, students will have a chance to learn about the Icelandic Sagas, including author/poet/politician Snorri Sturluson, and how these stories shaped the past and present of Iceland.</p><p>The Trinidad team included Keith Jones, Mark and Kay De Cook Endowed Chair in Character and Leadership Development and professor of psychology, Randy Renstrom, associate professor of psychology, and Shawn Wick, associate professor of sociology. Their trip was organized and facilitated by Amizade, a global service-learning provider that connected the faculty with non-governmental organizations and community partners throughout the island. One community partner seeks to educate the community about climate change and address pertinent environmental issues like reforestation, forest fire prevention and climate research. This program explores how culture and history influence identity, with a special emphasis on using service learning to explore those themes.</p><p>Central plans to roll out additional faculty-led off-campus experiences in the 2023-24 academic year.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.central.edu/2023/07/central-faculty-explore-new-international-programs/\">https://news.central.edu/2023/07/central-faculty-explore-new-international-programs/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8228378 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8228378</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68TC-BGS1-JC11-13YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 28, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Haskett and natural resources policy analyst Anne A. Riddle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are excerpts:</p><p>* * *</p><p>Is Climate Change Influencing Wildfires? Climate Change Effects on Wildfires in the United States</p><p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), climate change-driven increases in temperature, drought, and atmospheric drying have led to an increase in wildfire risk and wildfire burned area in the western United States. It is the assessment of the U.S. Forest Service (FS) that fire area and fire-caused tree mortality will increase under future climate change conditions. This Insight describes changes in wildfire activity in the United States in recent decades and the potential influence of climate change on wildfires under current and projected climate change conditions.</p><p>Recent Decades of Wildfire Activity in the United States</p><p>Wildfire extent and damage have been growing in the United States since 1983, when federal agencies first implemented current wildland fire reporting processes. Wildland fire statistics from the National Interagency Coordination Center indicate that the number of annual wildfires in the United States is variable but has decreased moderately from 1993 to 2022, while the number of acres burned annually, while also variable, has approximately doubled (Figure 1).</p><p>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) in the 2017 science volume of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, using a definition of a large fire as greater than 1,000 acres, reported that \"The incidence of large forest fires in the western United States and Alaska has increased since the early 1980s (high confidence).\" The 2018 volume of the assessment, which covers impacts and risks, states \"increasing wildfire is damaging ranches and rangelands as well as property in cities near the wildland - urban interface.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure 1. Annual Wildfires and Acres Burned, 1993-2022</p><p>Sources: CRS In Focus IF10244, Wildfire Statistics. Data from National Interagency Coordination Center, Wildland Fire Summary and Statistics annual reports.</p><p>Note: Data reflect wildland fires and acres burned nationwide, including wildland fires on federal and nonfederal lands.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Climate Change Influence on Wildfire</p><p>Climate change attribution studies of wildfires seek to quantify and distinguish the influence of human-caused climate change on wildfires from other influences. In the case of wildfires, these other factors may include historic fire suppression that may have increased fuel load, changes in settlement at the wildland urban interface (WUI), and natural climate variability.</p><p>Several recent climate change attribution studies suggest that human-caused climate change, independent of other factors, has increased the risk and the extent of wildfire. For example, in 2018, the USGCRP cited an attribution analysis that presents evidence that climate change has been increasing conditions favoring wildfires and the extent of wildfires in some areas of the United States. This analysis found that climate change has driven increases in temperature and atmospheric drying. The resulting drying of wildfire fuels across western U.S. forests during the 2000-2015 period contributed to an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential relative to a 1981-2000 baseline period. The authors of the analysis also concluded that during the 1984-2015 period, these climate drivers had approximately doubled the area of forest burned in the western United States. In another example, a 2023 attribution study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science found that climate change had driven increases in temperature and atmospheric drying of wildfire fuels in California. The authors concluded that almost all of the fivefold increase in the area burned by wildfires in California from 1996 to 2021 compared with 1971-1995 could be attributed to human-caused climate change.</p><p>Some modeling studies of future climate change have projected increases in wildfire effects on forests in the United States. In 2020, the FS used climate models to assess the effects of climate change on U.S. forests. This assessment found that increases in fire area and fire-caused tree mortality were expected under future conditions of climate change in all parts of the conterminous United States. A later FS modeling study was included as part of the research basis of the 2022 Office of Management and Budget white paper on the federal government's financial risk exposure to climate change. That FS modeling also found that the area burned by wildfires in the United States is projected to increase under conditions of human-caused climate change. The influence of climate change on wildfire is unlikely to be uniform, as the USGCRP found that \"[i]ncreases in future forest fire extent, frequency, and intensity depend strongly on local ecosystem properties and will vary greatly across the United States.\"</p><p>Considerations for Congress</p><p>According to the FS 10-year wildfire implementation plan published in 2022, the increase in the size and severity of wildfires has placed \"homes, communities, infrastructure, and natural resources at grave and growing risk,\" with wide-ranging impacts to local economies and communities, human wellbeing, and the environment. As such, wildfire could affect broad areas of federal activity, including several federal roles related specifically to wildfire. Agencies that manage federal lands are responsible for wildfire management on those lands, including fire suppression, post-fire recovery, and managing the land for wildfire (as it comports with the agency's mission), including reducing its likelihood and severity. The federal government also may provide assistance for wildfire suppression and preparedness on nonfederal land. Lastly, the federal government may provide a variety of post-fire disaster assistance to individuals, businesses, communities, and other groups.</p><p>Potential climate change-induced increases in future wildfire frequency and burned area, as well as other factors such as forest and fuels management and development in the WUI, could affect these federal activities in a variety of ways. For example, increases in burned area could increase the number of people and communities affected, potentially increasing demand for federal disaster relief and suppression resources. Some federal spending related to wildfire has increased in recent decades--for example, appropriations for wildfire management increased from 2011 to 2020. Most of this increase was attributable to wildfire suppression spending. Changes in wildfire risk and extent could shape a wide range of congressional debates, from the appropriate level and distribution of wildfire-related federal spending to the management of federal lands to the federal role in disaster response. These changes also could inform debates regarding the federal response to climate change.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The white paper is posted at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12288\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12288</url></p><p>[Category: CRSCRS]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8417030 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8417030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WK-7DT1-JC11-108J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1210\"/><timeReceived>8:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 16, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Identification of forest burn severity is essential for fire assessments and a necessary procedure in modern forest management.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key R&amp;D Program Project of The 13TH Five-year Plan. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Southwest Forestry University: \"Due to the low efficiency and labor intensity of the current post-fire field survey in China's Forestry Standards, the limitation of temporal resolution of satellite imagery, and poor objectivity of manual interpretations, a new method for automatic extraction of forest burn severity based on small visible unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is proposed. Taking the forest fires which occurred in Anning city of Yunnan Province in 2019 as the study objects, post-fire imagery was obtained by a small, multi-rotor near-ground UAV. Some image recognition indices reflecting the variations in chlorophyll loss effects in different damaged forests were developed with spectral characteristics customized in A and C, and the texture features such as the mean, standard deviation, homogeneity, and shape index of the length-width ratio. An object-oriented method is used to determine the optimal segmentation scale for forest burn severity and a multilevel rule classification and extraction model is established to achieve the automatic identification and mapping. The results show that the method mentioned above can recognize different types of forest burn severity: unburned, damaged, dead, and burnt. The overall accuracy is 87.76%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.8402, which implies that the small visible UAV can be used as a substitution for the current forest burn severity survey standards.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research is of great practical significance for improving the efficiency and precision of forest fire investigation, expanding applications of small UAVs in forestry, and developing an alternative for forest fire loss assessments in the forestry industry.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Automated Extraction of Forest Burn Severity Based on Light and Small UAV Visible Remote Sensing Images.

Those were in addition to the 4,500 people who on Friday were forced to move out of harm's way on the Atlantic island that is home to around a million people and is also a popular tourist destination.</p><p>That figure of more than 8,000 evacuees is expected to rise, and perhaps sharply.</p><p>The Canary Islands have been in drought for most of the past few years, just like most of mainland Spain. The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years because of changing weather patterns impacted by climate change.</p><p>European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p><p>Greek authorities on Saturday evacuated eight villages near the northeastern border with Turkey, where a large summer wildfire was burning out of control, whipped up by high winds.</p><p>The Tenerife fire comes as Spain's mainland is bracing for another heat wave. Spain's state weather service issued a warning Saturday that temperatures would be on the rise in the coming days, hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in parts of the mainland.</p><p>Spain had a record-hot 2022 and is setting new heat records this year amid a prolonged drought that has authorities on alert for wildfires.</p><p>Emergency services for the Canary Islands said later that the number of evacuees \"could surpass 26,000\" according to provisional calculations based on the island's census. The service added that all those people who needed somewhere to take refuge would be directed to shelters.</p><p>The regional government said that \"the fire is beyond our capacity to extinguish it\" due to hot and dry conditions and high winds that have fanned the huge flames. Firefighters have been unable to establish a perimeter around the blaze that has consumed at least 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres)</p><p>\"We have never seen a fire of this dimension on the Canary Islands,\" the island's governor, Rosa D\u00c3\u00a1vila, said.</p><p>No injuries have been reported since the fire broke out late on Tuesday.</p><p>Some 265 firefighters battled the blaze with the help of 19 aircraft, which included units from the mainland sent to help.

About 2,600 people remained in the city, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with residents who refused to leave.</p><p>The fires were unnerving for residents across the region, with plumes of smoke visible by day and an eerie orange nighttime glow.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met Friday with some of the Yellowknife evacuees in Edmonton, Alberta, on Saturday shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: \"We've got your back.\"</p><p>Trudeau praised firefighters, police, military personnel, the Red Cross and others who responded to the fires and other natural disasters this summer.</p><p>\"Terrible loss, increased extreme weather events. And all through it, we've seen Canadians step up,\" he told reporters in Edmonton.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>Video shot by Todd Ramsay north of Kelowna captured the moment of alarm when nearby trees caught fire, and his family was forced to flee in traffic gridlocked by emergency vehicles and people trying to escape.</p><p>The University of British ColumbiaOkanagan campus in Kelowna, which had fewer than its usual 11,000 students during a summer session, received the order to evacuate Friday afternoon. The order remained in effect Saturday.</p><p>West Kelowna Fire Chief Jason Brolund told a news conference Friday that the fire \"was exponentially worse than we expected.\"</p><p>But Saturday, he said, brought a reprieve: 200 additional firefighters along with calmer and cooler weather conditions.</p><p>In Yellowknife, air tankers dropped water and fire retardant on the flames. A 6-mile fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 12 miles of hose and a plethora of pumps in the fight to keep the fire at bay.</p><p>About 19,000 people had left Yellowknife in under 48 hours, with about 15,000 driving out in convoys and 3,800 leaving on emergency flights, officials said. The last 39 hospital patients were flown out Friday night on a Canadian Forces plane, officials said.</p><p>By Saturday, the streets were nearly empty and stores and gas stations were shuttered. \"It's a ghost town,\" said Kieron Testart, who had gone door-to-door in the nearby First Nation communities of Dettah and NDilo to check on people Friday.</p><p>Heritage Minister Pascale St. Onge, meanwhile, urged Meta to lift its \"reckless\" ban on users sharing local news on its Facebook and Instagram social media platforms. Meta said it enabled its \"safety check\" program for users to let others know they were safe, and was encouraging users to access information from official government agencies, emergency services and non-governmental organizations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-5267131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:690M-SRS1-DYWP-8035-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Some of them traveled by air, with an aircraft owned by the Ministry of National Defense, and others traveled by land with specific means of intervention.Also, Romania sent a total of ten forest firefighting trucks to Greece, five 10,000 litre trucks, one 30,000 liter truck, a 30 tonne water tanker, a rapid intervention truck with a capacity of 600 liters of water, a mobile camp for staff accommodation, two minibuses and three first-response Duster cars and order.The external support mission is carried out through the European Civil Protection Mechanism of the European Union.Affected by one of the most persistent heatwaves in recent decades, with temperatures reaching over 46 degrees Celsius on Sunday, Greece has been fighting wildfires since last week. The violent fire that broke out in the tourist island of Rhodes, in the southeast of the Aegean Sea, led on Saturday, July 22, to the evacuation of 30,000 tourists, \"the biggest operation (of this kind) ever carried out in Greece,\" according to the Greek authorities.Romanian tourists who have accommodation reservations in the southern part of the island of Rhodes, affected by the fires, will be relocated to the northern areas, the National Association of Travel Agencies (ANAT) announced on Monday, adding that no travel cancellations have been registered so far. According to ANAT, approximately 15% of the surface of the island of Rhodes, namely the southern part, was affected by fires, which led to the temporary closure of several hotels in this area. However, charter flights to the island operate normally, thus ensuring the continuity of scheduled vacations.The pre-positioning program is organized by the General Directorate of European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations - DG ECHO, in order to strengthen the resilience of the Greek authorities in managing this type of risk. The aim of the program is to reduce the response time in case of forest fires, to make the activity of preparing the intervention units belonging to the member states more efficient, as well as to improve the interoperability between the participating forces. The activation and operationalization of the specialized module for extinguishing forest fires is carried out for the execution of specific missions of monitoring and extinguishing outbreaks on the territory of Greece, in the locations established by the Greek partners. <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://actmedia.eu/daily/romania-helps-greece-in-fight-against-fires-with-150-firemen-specific-intervention-hardware/104105\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ACTM134219169026547857625876100132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ACTM-134219</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68SP-YD31-JCMN-Y1VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567483</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><timeReceived>6:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The service added that all those people who needed somewhere to take refuge would be directed to shelters.</p><p>The regional government said that \u201cthe fire is beyond our capacity to extinguish it\u201d due to hot and dry conditions and high winds that have fanned the huge flames. Firefighters have been unable to establish a perimeter around the blaze that has consumed at least 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres)</p><p>\u201cWe have never seen a fire of this dimension on the Canary Islands,\u201d the island\u2019s governor, Rosa D\u00e1vila, said.</p><p>No injuries have been reported since the fire broke out late on Tuesday.</p><p>Some 265 firefighters battled the blaze with the help of 19 aircraft, which included units from the mainland sent to help.

The blaze in Manchester, near Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, forced the evacuation of dozens of homes late Tuesday, with police going door-to-door to ask people to go to a temporary shelter at a nearby high school. The fire started Tuesday afternoon amid gusty winds, warm temperatures, low humidity and dried-out fuel, according to Trevor Raynor, a warden with state's Forest Fire Service. </p><p>It was about 50 percent contained as of Wednesday morning, but officials said they didn't expect its perimeter to grow further. \"This fire exhibited extreme fire behavior,\" said John Cecil, an assistant commissioner in the state's Department of Environmental Protection. \"I don't mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in a place and protect lives and property from that.\" Firefighters initially tried to keep the blaze - named the Jimmy's Waterhole Fire after a water hole where the blaze was particularly intense - from crossing Route 539, but couldn't stop the flames, Raynor said. Eventually, a perimeter was constructed, using pavement, roadways and other barriers, he added. There were some 75 firefighters, two helicopters, bulldozers and 15 fire engines involved. Manchester and the Defense Department's military installation are nestled in the state's Pinelands, a million-acre preserve, about halfway between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. A cause of the fire wasn't given, but authorities said they're investigating. Dry, warm weather is forecast in the coming days, with the next chance for rain not expected until the weekend. The National Weather Service said there's an elevated risk of wildfire spread because of the low humidity, gusty winds and dried-out fuel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018775ccdfdfaf9f75ed65890000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:686J-YMN1-DY7N-F502-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 12, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CP</classCode><className>DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

West Kelowna Fire Chief Jason Brolund told a news conference that the fire \"was exponentially worse than we expected.\"</p><p>\"We fought 100 years of fires all in one night,\" he said Friday, ahead of another night of battling the flames. There were no reports of deaths but he said \"significant number\" of structures were destroyed.</p><p>Firefighters in Yellowknife, the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories, feared the fire could reach the city this weekend without rain. The forecast called for sunny skies across the province Saturday.</p><p>Officials said Friday evening that about 19,000 people had left Yellowknife in less than 48 hours, with about 15,000 driving out in convoys and 3,800 leaving on emergency flights.</p><p>There were fears that the only escape route could be cut off as about 2,600 people remained behind, including emergency teams, firefighters, utility workers and police officers, along with residents who refused to leave.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met Friday with some of the Yellowknife evacuees in Edmonton, shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday that, \"We've got your back.\"</p><p>Trudeau praised firefighters, police, military personnel, the Red Cross and others who responded to this natural disaster and others this summer.</p><p>\"Terrible loss, increased extreme weather events.

Pascale St. Onge described Meta's policy, instituted in response to a new law requiring Meta to pay news providers, as \"reckless.\"</p><p>Meta said it enabled its \"safety check\" program for users to let others know they were safe, while encouraging people to access information from official government agencies, emergency services and non-governmental organizations.</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year that have caused choking smoke in parts of the U.S. All told, there have been more than 5,700 fires, which have burned more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>The fires were unnerving for residents in British Columbia, with plumes of smoke by day and an eerie orange glow at night.</p><p>Video shot by Todd Ramsay north of Kelowna captured the moment of alarm when nearby trees caught fire, and his family was forced to flee in traffic gridlocked by emergency vehicles and people trying to escape.</p><p>In Yellowknife, air tankers dropped water and fire retardant on the flames. A 6-mile fire line was dug, and firefighters deployed 12 miles of hose and a plethora of pumps in the fight to keep the fire at bay.</p><p>Streets were nearly empty and stores were shuttered. A grocery store and a pharmacy remained open Friday but were expected to close.

Those were in addition to the 4,500 people who on Friday were forced to move out of harm\u2019s way on the Atlantic island that is home to around a million people and is also a popular tourist destination.</p><p>That figure of more than 8,000 evacuees is expected to rise, and perhaps sharply.</p><p>The Canary Islands have been in drought for most of the past few years, just like most of mainland Spain. The islands have recorded below-average rainfall in recent years because of changing weather patterns impacted by climate change.</p><p>European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/hot-summer-climate-change-el-nino-9c5151f2fca2cd77d92a1c7bc61a0035\">wildfires in Europe</url>, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/greece-wildfires-evacuations-thessaloniki-626b4ddf55e0cebb28bb1c7ef8ad52ba\">Greek authorities on Saturday evacuated eight villages</url> near the northeastern border with Turkey, where a large summer wildfire was burning out of control, whipped up by high winds.</p><p>The Tenerife fire comes as Spain\u2019s mainland is bracing for another heat wave. Spain\u2019s state weather service issued a warning Saturday that temperatures would be on the rise in the coming days, hitting 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in parts of the mainland.</p><p>Spain had a record-hot 2022 and is setting new heat records this year amid a prolonged drought that has authorities on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/spain-firefighters-wildfires-climate-change-catalonia-f5c3b45ffd1e05cf6277261ae383de1e\">alert for wildfires.</url></p><p>Emergency services for the Canary Islands said later that the number of evacuees \u201ccould surpass 26,000\u201d according to provisional calculations based on the island\u2019s census. The service added that all those people who needed somewhere to take refuge would be directed to shelters.</p><p>The regional government said that \u201cthe fire is beyond our capacity to extinguish it\u201d due to hot and dry conditions and high winds that have fanned the huge flames. Firefighters have been unable to establish a perimeter around the blaze that has consumed at least 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres)</p><p>\u201cWe have never seen a fire of this dimension on the Canary Islands,\u201d the island\u2019s governor, Rosa D\u00e1vila, said.</p><p>No injuries have been reported since the fire broke out late on Tuesday.</p><p>Some 265 firefighters battled the blaze with the help of 19 aircraft, which included units from the mainland sent to help. More reinforcements are on the way, the central government said.</p><p>The fire is located in a steep and craggy mountain area with pine trees, with several municipalities on its flanks. Access for firefighters is extremely difficult.</p><p>The regional chief of the archipelago, Fernando Clavijo, said that police are investigating the cause of the fire.</p><p>The seven-island archipelago is located off the northwest coast of Africa and southwest of mainland Spain. At their nearest point, the islands are 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Morocco.</p><p>More than 2,000 people were evacuated in a wildfire on the nearby La Palma island last month that affected some 4,500 hectares (11,000 acres).</p><p>According to the European Forest Fire Information System, Spain heads the list of EU countries affected by wildfires so far this year, with 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) burned, ahead of Italy and Greece.</p><p>Spain accounted for almost 40% of the nearly 800,00 hectares (2 million acres) burned in the European Union in 2022, the EU agency said.</p><p>___</p><p>Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-29397d0e8a5ce7c3e4162280b553c06e20230819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6903-7RX1-DYMD-62H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><timeReceived>6:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 19, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Rushing was observed choking the other incarcerated person. Staff quickly responded, first issuing verbal orders to stop and get down, which were ignored. Officers then used chemical agents and less-lethal measures, which had no effect. When the other man appeared to lose consciousness and go limp, an officer fired his Mini-14 rifle.</p><p>Staff quickly initiated life-saving measures and summoned emergency services. Rushing, 46, was transported to an outside hospital and at 7:07 p.m. was pronounced deceased. The other incarcerated person was treated at an on-site medical facility. No staff or other incarcerated people were injured. An inmate-manufactured weapon was recovered at the scene.</p><p>The officer who deployed the Mini-14 round is currently on administrative leave consistent with CDCR policy. The officer's name is being withheld due to the ongoing investigation.</p><p>Rushing was sentenced on Sept. 19, 1996 in San Diego County and received by CDCR on Oct. 1, 1996. He was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for first-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter with an enhancement of terminate pregnancy and arson of structure or forest fire. While he was incarcerated he was sentenced in Amador County on March 25, 2022 to two years for possession of a manufactured deadly weapon by a prisoner.</p><p>Officials have limited movement on the yard where the incident happened to facilitate the investigation. The Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Internal Affairs were notified and peer support services are available. The Sacramento County Coroner will determine Rushing's official cause of death.</p><p>Activated in 1986, CSP-SAC is a high-security prison in Folsom that houses 1,940 incarcerated people and employs about 1,700 staff. The institution houses those serving long-term sentences, those requiring specialized mental health programming, and incarcerated people with high-risk medical concerns. The institution also provides work, career technical education, academic, self-help, art, religious and other rehabilitative programs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125877964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6850-2251-JCBF-S0XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 2, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In recent years, forest fires have not only destroyed a large amount of vegetation but also the number and burning area of forest fires in the world have increased significantly.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Basic Research Program of China. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National Satellite Meteorological Center: \"In order to reflect the dynamic monitoring analysis and risk assessment of fires in my country in the past 14 years, this paper selects the national terrestrial forest as an area and uses satellite sensing products with a long time series to analyze the time and space of forest burning biomass and forest fires from a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Feature.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"A power-law distribution-based estimation model for forest burning biomass was established, and the accuracy of the estimation results and the interannual variation pattern reached more than 98%, forming the regional sensitivity of the remote sensing evaluation method. With the emergence of new sensors such as NPP-VIIRS and HIGH, the emergence of high-resolution data has enhanced the ability of forest fire area extraction and fire point information identification, which provides more data sources for forest burning NG biomass estimation and forest fire spatial and temporal pattern analysis using these thermal infrared sensors.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dynamic Fire Monitoring Analysis and Risk Assessment Based on Multisource Satellite Remote Sensing.

But the European Union is working on new ways to control the flames.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Dominique Soguel Special correspondent</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">July was ablaze in Europe. This summer's wildfires nearly engulfed a train traveling between Galicia and Madrid in Spain, creating panic among passengers. Rapid, high flames overtook and killed an older couple fleeing in their car in Portugal. On Aug. 7, on the Adriatic island of Hvar, a Croatian man died protecting his house. Forest fires also forced thousands to flee their homes in southern France.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wildfires the Continent has experienced this season are not its deadliest, but the scenes have been dramatic. In all, wildfires larger than 30 hectares (74 acres) have burned more than 2,300 square miles of land in the European Union this year. \"This is the second-highest annual total since 2006,\" says Daniel Puglisi, press officer of the EU commission for crisis management and humanitarian aid. And the fire season doesn't end until October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just how bad have wildfires been in Europe?</p><p>The number of fires and burned areas has been record-breaking in many countries of the EU. Especially in southern Europe, the number of fires in 2022 significantly surpassed the annual average documented since 2006, the starting point for the data set of the European Forest Fire Information System.</p><p>As of early August, Romania has been the country with the most dramatic spike, registering more than 700 fires this year. Flames there consumed 580 square miles (0.6% of the country's area) compared with an average of 55 square miles annually between 2006 and 2011. Spain, Italy, France, and Croatia have also seen an extreme rise in the number of fires, with the total burned area also representing a notable increase for all but Italy.</p><p>Portugal's wildfires have proved severe enough this summer to prompt the declaration of a state of emergency\u00a0- no doubt also spurred by memories of the devastating 2017 wildfires, which killed more than 100 people.</p><p>\"What we're seeing is a lot of large fires occurring simultaneously that are starting outside of what was the traditional fire season,\" says V\u00edctor Resco de Dios, professor of forestry engineering at the University of Lleida in Spain. \"More than the number of fires, I think what's remarkable is that a very large number of large fires are occurring simultaneously on a subcontinental scale.\"</p><p>What is causing the fires?</p><p>The immediate triggers for forest and wildland fires have been kaleidoscopic.</p><p>Some fires are sparked by human error or negligence, such as the failure of landowners to remove dead or dry leaves and pine needles from their properties. Others - like the one in the Channel island of Alderney - have been attributed to lightning. Firefighters say the natural phenomenon can be the most dangerous as lightning tends to strike in remote areas where it is more difficult to intervene quickly.</p><p>In the Mediterranean, most wildfires are ignited by humans. For example, \"the main fire cause in Portugal is human activities, either by accident, negligence, or arson,\" says Joana Parente, a\u00a0postdoctoral researcher focused on wildfires in Portugal. \"Yes, we have natural wildfires. However, they only represent an average of 0.5% of the wildfires.\" And across Europe, arsonists are to blame in an alarming number of cases, among them an adrenaline-seeking French firefighter.</p><p>Hot and dry weather is no help. Europe has experienced a spate of heat waves this summer, and globally July was the third hottest on record. It's not possible at this stage to conclusively say whether the heat waves are due to climate change. But climate scientists are already analyzing the matter, and experts concur that drought conditions and record-breaking high temperatures that kicked off early this year exacerbated the wildfire situation.</p><p>\"Of course, the big question is, why do we have that?\" says Robert Stefanski of the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization. \"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is indicating that we will see hotter and drier weather, especially in the Mediterranean areas. So that's an indication of things to come.\"</p><p>In Spain and Portugal, economic reasons also play a role, with populations shifting away from rural areas. Wood is no longer collected for energy. The decline of small farmers has transformed the landscape and created conditions conducive to fire spread.</p><p>\"With climate change, the fuel\u00a0- the trees, the foliage - dries earlier,\" says Mr. Resco de Dios. \"So this fuel becomes available earlier than what traditionally is the case. And this climate change is also due to a state of abandonment of forests that are no longer profitable in Europe, especially in southern Europe. Forest management is not profitable, and in many cases, neither is agricultural use.\"</p><p>\"Agriculture is important because [farms] create spatial heterogeneity,\" adds Mr. Resco de Dios. \"When we have the landscape bisected with agricultural fields, it is more difficult for the fire to become a large forest fire. ... In agricultural areas, fires burn with less intensity and provide a point from where they can be extinguished. But as this spatial heterogeneity is being lost and as everything is becoming more uniform, there are more and more forests with a lot of biomass. And this is a factor that leads to large fires.\"</p><p>What is Europe doing to address the problem?</p><p>While forest fire prevention and response is a national responsibility, the EU budget does carve out (EURO)893 million ($920 million) for supplemental support. And within RescEU, the bloc's disaster emergency response and civil protection resource pool, the EU has assembled a fleet of 12 firefighting airplanes and one helicopter for peak forest fire season. Portugal, France, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic each asked for help from RescEU services once in July. Albania did so in June and July.</p><p>The EU also uses satellite data from the Copernicus Earth observation program to analyze wildfires in the bloc and beyond. It evaluates forest fire risk and maps burned areas.\u00a0This helps preemptive efforts and speeds up firefighting response.</p><p>Europe, like the United States, is also opening to the idea that allowing forests to burn naturally - or even setting preemptive burns on purpose - can help prevent mega-fires, especially at a time when models supported by satellite imagery and artificial intelligence provide fairly reliable predictions of fire conduct. But the idea faces pushback from some environmentalists.</p><p>Spain in particular shines for the progress it has made fighting fires in recent years. Aerial firefighting has taken off. Firefighters who cut their teeth in the devastating 1994 fires went on to form BRIF, a rapid-deployment specialized brigade akin to the special forces in the army. Spanish universities offer master's degrees and Ph.D.s focused on forest fires. And in the private sector, companies like Technosylva offer software solutions for wildfire protection planning, operational response, and firefighter and public safety.</p><p>\"Fire is no longer just something that is burning vegetation, but it's something that is threatening people, their property, and local economies,\" says Ra\u00fal Qu\u00edlez, who has been fighting fires since 1994 and is pursuing a Ph.D. in forest fires in Spain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-617a6b61be25f63d32768c1a4e4fa5af</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664N-8D81-DYRK-B091-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The IP Survey will extend a further 14-line kilometres west from the previous survey conducted in 2022, which demonstrated a chargeability response coincident with the Goldboro Mineral Resource. The IP Survey will critically extend over the area west of the Goldboro Deposit for approximately two kilometres, following a VLF geophysical survey which passes through the Goldboro Deposit and continues along strike to the past producing Dolliver Mountain Gold Mine. </p><p>The Company is also providing an update on recent forest fire activity in the Province of Nova Scotia, which early last week resulted in a restriction of all activity in and around forest land. The travel and work restrictions have now been lifted in most areas of the Province and the Company has begun to re-mobilize its work teams, including with respects to exploration drilling to the west of Goldboro. The Company is assessing the impact that the delay will have on its ongoing programs, including its updated Feasibility Study, in particular due to the delay of geotechnical drilling. \"We are relieved that the risks from the forest fires in Nova Scotia have been substantially reduced over the past few days and applaud the efforts of the Province to keep all residents and workers in Nova Scotia safe. While we are still assessing the potential impact of the delay on our schedule, we are happy to start drilling activity again at the Goldboro Project, both for exploration growth potential and geotechnical activity to support the Feasibility Study. Signal Gold is excited to initiate a further ground geophysical survey to the west of the Goldboro Deposit, as the best place to find a gold deposit is in the shadow of a headframe or next to an existing deposit - the area west of the Goldboro Deposit has both these characteristics. The first phase of the geophysical survey, along with recent drill results, confirmed that the structure, alteration, and gold mineralization at the Goldboro Deposit continues westward from the Deposit. Additionally, the first phase of ground geophysics and the subsequent drill results validate our exploration approach of targeting IP and VLF geophysical trends allowing us to optimize our exploration approach. With a diamond drill now testing the additional strike of mineralization identified by the first phase of the IP Survey and the extension of the ground geophysical program, there is significant opportunity to expand the near surface mineral resources at Goldboro,\" said Kevin Bullock, President and CEO.</p><p>COMTEX_434430647/2407/2023-06-06T07:43:54</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLYCOM-434430647</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLYCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D8-R2R1-DYWB-B00M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">295234</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><timeReceived>7:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Fly</copyright><bodyText><p>This content is provided to LexisNexis by Comtex News Network, Inc.</p></bodyText><publicationName>Theflyonthewall.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 6, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Ceo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Diamond</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Exploration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forest Fire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gold</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Impact</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nova Scotia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Result</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Schedule</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Strike</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;

Jim Justice, R-West Virginia, issued the following news release on Aug. 15, 2023:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gov. Jim Justice held a ceremony today at the West Virginia Division of Forestry (WV DOF) Region Four Headquarters in Beckley, where he signed SB 1032, which passed in the recent Special Session of the West Virginia Legislature, providing $4 million toward new equipment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the signing, Gov. Justice also announced the Region Four office will be renamed the Cody J. Mullens Region Four Headquarters. Mullens, 28, of Mt. Hope was killed in the line of duty in April 2023 while working to contain a forest fire near Montgomery. His family was present at the event and received ceremonial bills in his honor.</p><p>\"This year, we mourned the tragic loss of this brave West Virginian who gave his life to protect our state and her people. Today, we honor his life, his service and his sacrifice,\" Gov. Justice said. \"This bill will help our brave foresters get the equipment they need to continue to be on the front line of defense, both during spring and fall fire seasons and throughout the year.\"</p><p>These funds will be used to purchase equipment to assist WV DOF foresters in fighting wildfires. The new equipment will include woodland dozers, fire engines, water tank trucks, Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTVs), and thermal drones.</p><p>\"I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Gov. Justice for his unwavering support in funding critical firefighting equipment for the division,\" Assistant State Forester Jeremy Jones said. \"Your commitment to the safety and protection of our beautiful forest is deeply appreciated by the Division of Forestry. This historic investment will provide severely needed modernization to our wildfire program and equipment. Purchasing state-of-the-art equipment secured by these funds will enhance the capabilities of our firefighters, ensuring that we can respond swiftly and effectively to the ever-growing wildfire danger.\"</p><p>In addition to protecting West Virginia's forests and fighting wildfires, crews from WV DOF volunteer to assist with wildfire relief efforts in other states. Recently, a crew of 20 WV DOF personnel trained for wildfire suppression left on August 1, 2023, to help with wildfire suppression in Montana. The team is assisting the Northern Rockies GACC (Geographic Area Coordinating Centers) with containing a fire at the Tin Soldier Complex in the Flathead National Forest in Montana. The fires associated with the Tin Soldier Complex were started by lightning on Saturday, July 30.</p><p>\"While West Virginia's fire season will officially begin on October 1, other parts of the country already have a very active season. WV DOF is tasked with preventing and suppressing wildfires within the state; however, during the offseason, our Foresters assist with fire suppression efforts in other parts of the country,\" Jones said. \"They must attend rigorous training courses and maintain qualifications to be part of a western fire detail.\"</p><p>WV DOF has also dispatched crews to various single-resource assignments this summer in Arizona, California, Michigan, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Assignment to a western fire crew detail is voluntary; most crew members are on assignment for 14 days.</p><p>\"I am proud of our West Virginia Foresters for answering the call to serve in other states,\" Secretary of the WV Department of Commerce James Bailey said. \"We are fortunate to have the capacity to assist during this time of year, and it is important to help these vital efforts across the nation.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2023/Pages/Gov.-Justice-signs-bill-allocating-$4-million-for-new-firefighting-equipment,-renames-Region-Four-Division-of-Forestry.aspx\">https://governor.wv.gov/News/press-releases/2023/Pages/Gov.-Justice-signs-bill-allocating-$4-million-for-new-firefighting-equipment,-renames-Region-Four-Division-of-Forestry.aspx</url></p><p>Contact: Jordan Damron, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jordan.l.damron@wv.gov\">jordan.l.damron@wv.gov</email>;

Why were the fires so bad there?</h><p>In stark contrast to the U.S., it was the worst wildfire season ever recorded in Canada, with a whopping 45.7 million acres burned, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre</url>. Smoke from the fires spread across the border into the U.S. in the summer, creating hazy, surreal skies across the nation in cities from Chicago to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/07/haze-photos-new-york-pennsylvania-canada-wildfires/70296887007/\">New York</url>. </p><p>The reason for the disastrous fire season there, MacDonald told USA TODAY, is that western Canada and large stretches of the boreal forest (in northern Canada) experienced very dry and hot conditions coming into the wildfire season. \"That is the time when you saw the really huge areas of Canada experiencing fires,\" he said.  </p><p>MacDonald added that the contrast between California and western Canada was particularly striking in June, when \"you saw large areas of western Canada experiencing moderate to severe drought and most of California experiencing non-drought conditions and large persistent snowpacks in the mountains.\"</p><p>Wallmann said that lightning storms helped spark wildfires across Canada, also noting that it was extremely warm and dry early in the season nationwide.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/06/07/USAT/8cd65824-4f7b-4444-99de-6d6d6ccfdfa0-AP_Canada_Wildfires_New_York.1.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>What happened in Maui?</h><p>The 2023 wildfire season in the U.S. will be most remembered for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/19/global-warming-and-poor-emergency-plans-put-wildfire-risk-on-americas-doorstep/70614906007/\">catastrophic, deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii,</url> in August, which killed at least 99 people. </p><p>The fires in Maui and the resulting destruction of much of Lahaina were due to several factors, MacDonald said. The first cause was the abundance of fuel that was present in the form of flammable, fast-growing, invasive grasses around Lahaina.</p><p>Then in May, Maui began to experience a flash drought, which is a rapidly developing and intense drought. That flash drought dried out the vegetation and provided particularly dangerous fuel conditions. </p><p>Finally, in August, when Hurricane Dora passed to the south of Maui, despite being some 500 miles distant, it produced downslope winds towards Lahaina with gusts up to 60 mph. \"Unfortunately, the fire ignited in the worst of all conditions in terms of fuel and weather, and in a location that led to its spread into Lahaina itself,\" MacDonald said. </p><h>What does next fire season look like?</h><p>The severity of next year's fire season in the West and in Canada <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/11/west-water-crisis-depends-on-snowfall/71427297007/\">will be determined by the amount of winter precipitation and resulting snowpack</url>, and the spring and summer temperatures. \"A large snowpack with a slow melt and cool summer temperatures will dampen down fuel flammability, fire spread and intensity,\" he said.</p><h>How does climate change impact wildfires? Was this season an outlier?</h><p>The amount of acres burned due to wildfires annually in California and the western United States can vary wildly from year to year. For example in 2020 California saw 4 million acres burned, while this year\u2019s total thus far is only about 319,000 acres, according to MacDonald. </p><p>\"The variability reflects a number of factors including the seasonal conditions of temperature and precipitation, the timing and location of ignition events, and the weather and winds associated with a fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"However, if we take a long view and look at the overall statistics from 1980 to the present, there is a significant upward trend in annual areas burned,\" he said. Studies show that much of this overall trend in increasing annual area burned is related to higher temperatures and drier air, and the majority of these changes in climate are attributable to increasing greenhouse gasses due to human activities. </p><p>\"So yes, climate change is increasing wildfire risk,\" MacDonald concluded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/11/16/us-wildfire-season-quiet/71519695007/\">Climate change fuels wildfires, but it's been a quiet season in the West.

And in August, the Hawaiian island of Maui suffered the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century with more than 110 fatalities thus far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first line of defense against fire isn't water - it's information</p><p>When the fire starts, it'll be a while before anyone knows about it. At first, it's just a spark from a fallen wire - or maybe the smoldering trunk of a tree, struck by lightning. If the fire is in a remote location, it may not be noticed for hours. Even if it's noticed early, it'll take precious minutes to raise the alarm and alert firefighters to the emergency. All the while, the fire, fed by the summer heat and a stiff wind, is growing more intense, devouring everything in its path: land, property, natural habitats, and all-too-often human lives.\u00a0</p><p>It's literally true that every second counts. There's no time to waste. Efficiency can be a matter of life and death.\u00a0</p><p>And in this situation, the most efficient first line of defense against fire isn't water - it's\u00a0information. Think about it - you can't put out a fire if you don't know where it is or how to get there as quickly as possible.What's more, timely access to data about past fires provides crucial insight into the conditions that make fires more likely, allowing firefighters and local populations to anticipate and prevent them before they occur.</p><p>On the front lines of the climate wars</p><p>History tells us that in 64 A.D., Rome burned for six days, and the only action its emperor Nero took as he watched his city incinerate was to play the fiddle.</p><p>Luckily, that won't happen in Brazil.</p><p>Brumadinho-based\u00a0Brigada Carcar\u00e1\u00a0is a non-profit on the front lines of the climate wars. Its mission is to control forest fires and to support communities affected by natural and environmental disasters. As increasingly frequent and intense fires blaze through\u00a0Brazil's subtropical zones, the Brigada's role in preserving the lives and livelihoods of local residents, wildlife, farmers, and businesses, has become ever more critical - and ever more challenging.</p><p>Adding fuel to the fire</p><p>Until recently, Brigada's challenges were aggravated by a total reliance on manual processes and offline record-keeping. It took many hours, and often several days, to compile\u00a0data\u00a0about the causes of fires, their locations, and the nature and extent of the damage done.\u00a0</p><p>None of this information was digitally stored or easily accessible to firefighters and local authorities - and the limited analog information that\u00a0was\u00a0available was often incomplete and vulnerable to human error. Lack of transparency and timely, reliable insights into the circumstances of forest fires made it exceedingly difficult to respond effectively to new fires, let alone to avert future outbreaks. And when a fire did break out, firefighters had to depend on old-fashioned printed maps to find their way to the source of the blaze.\u00a0</p><p>With the world around them literally burning, something had to change.</p><p>Fighting fire - there's\u00a0an app\u00a0for that</p><p>Brigada Carcar\u00e1 turned to SAP to develop a dedicated platform to provide the tools they need to do their jobs with maximum efficiency - saving time, money, and, potentially, lives. A bespoke combination of\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite/what-is-sap-integration-suite.html\">SAP Integration Suite</url>, based on SAP HANA, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) did much more than merely digitize their existing firefighting operation - it provided them with an arsenal of new and powerful tools to predict where fires are likely to break out.</p><p>Brigada Carcar\u00e1's SAP solution has dramatically increased operational efficiency, supercharging their capacity to predict and respond to fires. The lynchpin is a new mobile application that facilitates detailed and\u00a0accurate\u00a0digital documentation of fire-related damage in real-time, including up-to-date digital maps and geo-tagged photo uploads. It also captures precise information about damage to property, land, and habitats. Not only does the new system capture more information - that information is far more reliable, up-to-date, and easily accessible.</p><p>Lucas Rom\u00e1rio Lara,\u00a0a founding member of the\u00a0Brigada Carcar\u00e1, described the transformative impact of their new solutions: \"The platform revolutionized our service structure, generating crucial real-time data for monitoring and analysis. We can now manage everything through our phones, from extinguishing fires, documenting burnt areas, identifying injured animals, and capturing images, to requesting immediate support from other teams. We can share data and best practices not only across the country but even with places like Portugal, which faces similar forest fire challenges.\"</p><p>Digital fire retardant</p><p>Brigada Carcar\u00e1\u00a0notable tangible improvements include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Enhanced fire prevention through improved monitoring and data analysis</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Reduced incident recording time from three days to one minute</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Structured reforestation plans driven by well-organized data for land and habitat protection</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Rehabilitation and replanting of fire-affected forests, involving analysis of charred areas and tree remnants, along with native species cultivation in nurseries</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Brigada member\u00a0Ronnie Gibson\u00a0sums it up quite nicely: \"The SAP application has equipped us for better preparedness.

Her motto seemed to be \"Speak softly about Trump and carry a sharp stick for Vivek Ramaswamy.\" Recently, though, Haley has made a hard pivot.</p><p><br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/01/new-hampshire-primary-nikki-haley/677227/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What Nikki Haley (maybe) learned in New Hampshire</url>]<br/>Just two days after she came in (a distant) second to Trump in the New Hampshire primary, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/haley-ramps-attacks-trump-ahead-south-carolina-showdown-rcna135736\">began fundraising</url> for the first time off his attacks on her-selling T-shirts with the slogan BARRED PERMANENTLY after the former president said that anyone who continues to support her will be \"permanently barred from the MAGA camp,\" whatever that means.<br/>In the past week, Haley has been on a tear, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/26/us/politics/nikki-haley-trump-unhinged.html\">calling Trump</url> \"totally unhinged,\" \"toxic,\" \"self-absorbed,\" and lacking in \"moral clarity.\" Her campaign unleashed a new attack-ad series in which Trump and President Joe Biden are portrayed as two <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/31/nation/nikki-haley-trump-biden-grumpy-old-men-campaign/\">\"grumpy old men\"</url> standing in the way of the next generation. And yesterday, Haley <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1753140193148760448\">posted a gag photo</url> of a Trump Halloween costume labeled \"Weakest General Election Candidate Ever.\" To paraphrase <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/2020-democratic-debate-marianne-williamson-says-first-act-as-president-would-be-call-to-new-zealand-pm\">the words of</url> the Democratic-primary candidate Marianne Williamson, Girlfriend, this is so on.<br/>Such an aggressive posture is new for Haley, and Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans have applauded her for it. She should have been talking this way all along, some of her supporters argue. \"If she started it sooner, she would've cut the lead in New Hampshire,\" Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in South Carolina, told me. In his view, Haley thought she \"had to play nice\" to win over Trump voters: \"But this ain't a nice game.\"<br/>Can Haley still achieve anything by playing hardball at this point? Things don't look promising. Her bid to defeat Trump is already the longest of long shots, based on the polls coming out of virtually every state, including Haley's own <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/01/trump-polls-haley-south-carolina-00139021\">South Carolina</url>. So what's the point of changing things up? Why muster the courage to smack-talk Trump now, when the race seems all but over? I asked a number of political strategists and experts for their view, and pieced together a few plausible theories. (Neither the Haley nor the Trump campaign responded to a request for comment.)<br/><br/>1. Attacking Trump is easier now.<br/> The most obvious theory for Haley's more combative rhetoric is that with only one other major candidate still in the primary, the task of drawing a direct contrast with Trump is much simpler. \"If you have six people in a race and a couple are attacking a couple others, it's hard to predict how that's going to work in terms of driving your ballots,\" David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican strategist, told me. \"When it's a multi-candidate field, you've got to tell your own story.\" After Iowa, \"that's resolved,\" he said, and so \"she has no choice but to turn her attention to Trump.\"<br/>The jabs are meant to draw Trump out-to pressure him to join her on a debate stage or to provoke a tantrum that turns off his potential voters and motivates her own. \"She needs him to make a mistake,\" Kochel said. \"She needs some intervening activity, some dynamic that is not completely in her control.\"<br/>Maybe this is a good moment for Haley to exploit Trump's weakness with women voters. In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, Biden beats Trump with the support of women, <url normalizedValue=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3889\">a new Quinnipiac poll</url> showed, and that gender gap appears to be growing. Last week, Haley <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/NikkiHaley/status/1751027117624524904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1751027117624524904%7Ctwgr%5Ed7d256bd493c37472808743ef29798099b768a7b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fnikki-haley-drags-trump-over-dollar83-million-e-jean-carroll-defamation-fine\">dragged Trump</url> over his defamation-case loss to E. Jean Carroll, in which he was ordered to pay $83 million in additional defamation damages to the woman whom he was previously found liable for defaming and sexually abusing. \"Haley is running the Taylor Swift strategy in the primary,\" Steve Bannon, Trump's former White House chief strategist, told me. \"She's playing to the ~Trump is toxic' women's vote.'\" The pop star's <url normalizedValue=\"https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/18-of-voters-more-likely-to-back-taylor-swift-endorsed-presidential-candidate-poll-shows-2024-election-voting-ballot-biden-trump-white-house-politics-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs\">apparent potential</url> to influence Americans, and especially women, to vote Democratic, coupled with the results of the Quinnipiac poll, represent \"deep, underlying forces that need to be addressed,\" Bannon said-something Haley will continue to seize on.<br/>2. Haley's anti-Trump rhetoric represents the death throes of her campaign.<br/> Haley's campaign has followed the same trajectory as several other Republicans' efforts in the Trump era: They might have avoided attacking him directly at first, but when their prospects dimmed, they lashed out. Marco Rubio <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/marco-rubio-mocks-donald-trumps-spray-tan-small-37280875\">mocked Trump's small hands</url> just before dropping out of the race; Ted Cruz <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/ted-cruz-blasts-trump-he-a-pathological-liar/97557ECE-968A-4E8C-B1D9-91767201C3A8\">called</url> Trump a \"pathological liar\" at the tail end of his own campaign. \"It seems like they all have consultants in their ear telling them if they take on Trump directly, they are going to crater support with the base, which is true,\" Tim Miller, a political consultant and writer at the conservative outlet The Bulwark, told me. \"Then, finally, when they're up against the wall and in the final stages, they figure it's worth a shot.\"<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/01/nikki-haley-2024-campaign-primary-trump/677084/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What is Nikki Haley even talking about?</url>]<br/>Maybe ratcheting up the combativeness is a form of emotional catharsis. When I asked the Democratic strategist James Carville about Haley's change in approach, he texted me that Haley \"is tired, scared &amp;amp; pissed off.\" Because she's trailing Trump in her own state, \"certain doom in SC is eating at her. NEVER discount the human element.\" Haley now sounds a lot more like she did behind closed doors during the Trump administration, Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant, told me, citing conversations he's had with former Haley staffers. \"This is Nikki therapy,\" he said. \"She's just having fun poking him in the eye, getting all her ya-yas out. It's the most entertaining dead-cat bounce in history.\"<br/>3. Haley is giving her donors what they want.<br/> Haley's billionaire supporters adore this new, aggressively anti-Trump candidate, and they're rewarding her with cash. \"Nikki's more aggressive posture toward Trump was welcomed as it is communicating the stark choice in front of the party,\" Bill Berrien, the CEO of the manufacturer Pindel Global Precision, who hosted a fundraiser for Haley in New York, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/01/nikki-haley-makes-renewed-case-donors/\">told The Washington Post</url>. Cliff Asness, a co-founder of AQR Capital Management and a Haley donor, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/CliffordAsness/status/1751034471040557482\">wrote on X</url> that, in response to Trump's attacks, he \"may have to contribute more\" to her.<br/>At least some of these funders are convinced that Haley still has a shot. \"She's got donors saying, ~You have a credible campaign, and you never know when Trump is going to choke to death on a meatloaf,'\" Murphy said. Whether or not Haley believes that, she's going along with it. The odds that she might become the nominee through an act of God or a brokered convention, after all, are probably better than buying a Power Ball ticket. \"It's a clutching-at-straws thing, but she's got the best straw in town to clutch on,\" Murphy said. \"Why the hell not? It's free and fun.\"<br/>4. Haley is looking to a post-Trump future.<br/> A few weeks ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4384685-bannon-predicts-big-fight-over-haley-trump-vp/#:~:text=Steve%20Bannon%2C%20ex%2Daide%20to,president%20in%20the%20general%20election.\">rumors circulated</url> that Haley might be on Trump's shortlist for vice president. If the decision, though unlikely, went her way, that could set her up to be Trump's political heir. But Haley's recent hostility toward Trump-and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/01/23/new-hampshire-primary-2024/trumps-victory-speech-00137480\">splenetic response</url>-have surely shut the door on that possibility. Instead, Haley is staking out her own territory.<br/>\"She's not done. She's running for 2028,\" Sarah Isgur, a senior editor at The Dispatch and a former deputy campaign manager for the 2016 Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina, told me. Trump has \"changed her brand-thinking.\" Instead of gunning for some sort of role in MAGA world, Haley can portray herself as the last person standing in the war against Trumpism-a position that many men before her have fought for and failed to achieve. If she can do that, she can consolidate a leadership future for herself, post-Trump, Isgur said.<br/>Haley will be able to say \"I told you so\" if Trump loses to Biden in November-or if he wins but then governs disastrously. She'll be \"the good conservative who tried to warn you,\" Murphy said. This also means that after the race is over, she'll have to lie low for a while, and not join other Trump rivals turned grovelers, including Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. She's playing \"the long-term game,\" Murphy said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-donaldtrumprepublicanprimarynikkihaley677333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7W-73D1-DYY9-J003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

A gentle wind went <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">shhh</emphasis> through tall hemlocks as my family paddled, two by two, to a rocky islet at the center of Mountain Lake, on the flank of Mount Constitution. There we clambered ashore, and the kids, Agnes and Rex, immediately began darting among the lodgepole pines, collecting sticks and pine cones to build fairy houses. Aside from the faint smell of a forest fire burning in the Cascades and a smudge of smoke on the eastern sky, it could have been a scene from my own childhood.</p><p>When I was eight years old, my mother moved my three younger brothers and me to Anacortes, a small island town about two hours north of Seattle. It is the gateway to the San Juan Islands, an archipelago within the Puget Sound and the broader Salish Sea, which divides Washington State from Canada. As an underemployed single mom to four young boys, she needed inexpensive outlets for our considerable energy. Taking our bikes onto the ferry and spending the day in the San Juans was an ideal solution. Certain activities here-huddling inside beach forts assembled out of bleached driftwood, waving at cars while cycling along the agricultural back roads of Lopez Island, watching from the second deck for the underwater \"burp\" of the ferry as it departs a port-are woven into the helices of my DNA. But I hadn't been in more than two decades. So I booked a trip, to show the islands to my kids, to reconnect with them as an adult, and perhaps to have a few experiences that were out of reach for me as a child. As an added bonus, my mom came along too.</p><p>We posted up in a cozy log cabin at Lakedale lodge, a rustic mini kingdom on the island of San Juan, about 10 minutes from the main town of Friday Harbor. To enter, you cross a small causeway-the compound is an island within the island. Karl Bruno, Lakedale's well-seasoned general manager, told me that its founders were pond builders, who in the late 60s convinced the county to raise the road so that they could create the three lakes around which the resort is now arranged. For a generation it was a campground only, but today there are yurts and canvas cottages in addition to the cabins and tranquil main lodge. Families come back every summer to play life-size checkers and chess, construct birdhouses, and fish in the lakes for cutthroat trout. Sometimes the kids return as grown-ups to have weddings here.</p><p>Friday Harbor, a charming village that spills up a steep hill from the ferry terminal, looked just as it had 35 years ago, though I suspect that when I was little, the caf\u00e9s were less chic and the sandwich shops not quite so artisanal. Certainly, the San Juans today have more private islands owned by tech billionaires and more boho big-city refugees, many of whom arrived during the pandemic, than they once did, but this is a place whose residents like things to stay as they are. At Vic's Drive-In, a classic diner on the outskirts of Friday Harbor that claims to be the island's longest continuously operating restaurant, co-owner Brian Carlson, a predecessor of Karl Bruno at Lakedale, tells me about the outrage when a previous owner tried to change the name to Vic's Driftwood Drive-in. Why? \"Because it's Vic's, and people in Friday Harbor hate change.\" Driving through the woods of Orcas, I kept noticing signage that felt as if it could have been there 50 years ago: \"American Legion Sunday Morning Pancake Breakfast\"; \"Orcas Island Jazz Festival\"; \"Indralaya, a Theosophical Society.\" And, nailed to a telephone pole by a driftwood-strewn beach near the charming town of Eastsound: \"Be Kind.\"</p><p>But what most teleported me back to childhood was the San Juans' eternal landscape, especially its shorelines. On the other side of San Juan Island at Lime Kiln Point, one of the area's best places to spot whales, the kids and I clambered around the igneous rock formations splayed beneath the quaint 106-year-old Lime Kiln Lighthouse, marveling at the tenacity of the madrones that clung to them. Across the Strait of Juan de Fuca we could see the Olympic Peninsula, indistinct in the haze of the wildfires. If the day had been clear, I knew from memory, we would have been able to see Mount Rainier seeming to float on the southern horizon. On the Shark Reef Sanctuary Trail on sleepy Lopez, we emerged from old-growth fir trees to traipse along the bluffs, looking for crabs in tide pools, marveling at the countless barnacles, and observing a colony of sea lions sunning themselves on a rocky outcropping a few hundred feet offshore.</p><p>Later that day we went to Spencer Spit, where a sandy beach separates a quiet saltwater lagoon from the sound. Well-fed clouds, almost too substantial to be believed, floated above islands carpeted with evergreens, cheerful sailboats, and a poky ferry slowly gliding along the navy blue waters. My kids found a driftwood fort taller than me, with a plank you could move aside affixed with a sheet of paper that was labeled \"Door.\" They quickly joined forces with siblings from Oregon and embarked on an ambitious series of home improvements: patching up holes, putting in furniture, erecting a seaweed flag. There was already a lump rising in my throat when my mother turned to me and asked, \"Does this remind you a lot of childhood afternoons?\"</p><p>Something I never got to do as a kid was eat at nice restaurants, and there are so many on these islands that make ingenious use of the region's beautiful ingredients. Perhaps our favorite meal was at Buck Bay Shellfish Farm on Orcas, where we ate oysters on the half shell and seafood rolls artfully adorned with edible flowers at a picnic table steps from the bay where the restaurant grows its own crustaceans. Chi, my wife, trapped the persistent yellow jackets under spent oyster shells until a waiter arrived with lavender oil and instructed us to apply it to our wrists to ward off the insects.</p><p>I definitely never got to go on a whale-watching tour, so I booked one with Western Prince Whale Watching Adventures. Ivan Reiff, its owner and captain, bought the business more than two decades ago, motivated by a desire to escape the rat race and make a living on the water. Our guide was Katie Jones, a veteran naturalist who also works at the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor. \"I'm going to stick my neck out and say orcas are some of the most social animals on the planet,\" she said. \"More social even than we are.\" Before long, we found a pair: Sprinter, a 20-year-old adult male, and Esperanza, born in the 1960s and presumed to be Sprinter's grandmother. We followed them for 45 minutes as they cruised along, hunting harbor seals near a rocky outcropping covered with cormorants and other nesting birds. The sharp black triangles of their dorsal fins felt like the yin to the yang of the white sails dotting the sound.</p><p>We ventured briefly into Canadian waters, then passed Turn Point Light Station, atop the striated sandstone walls of Stuart Island. The depth of the sound here reaches 1,300 feet. These islands, Katie observed, are just the tops of the mountains; their southern sides are often barren because of the movement of the glaciers which carved out the Salish Sea 10,000 years ago. In the place where our boat was, there once would have been a mile of ice above our heads. I realized right then that even if I'd had no childhood connection to the San Juans, I still would have found visiting them as an adult to be astonishing.</p><p>The feeling of wonder continued that evening, when Chi and I left the kids with my mom and ventured out onto the water at dusk with Discovery Sea Kayaks to experience the bioluminescent wonders of the noctiluca. This millimeter-long single-celled organism thrives in the deep, cold, nutrient-rich waters of the Salish Sea, especially during the long days of summer, which give it time to recharge. It operates according to circadian rhythms, growing brighter as the night goes on. Our guide was Kelly Yelverton, a Colorado native who'd been in the San Juans since 2010. She was assisted by Caleb Johnson, a native of Beaumont, Texas, who'd been traveling with his wife in a van for the past five years, doing seasonal work and hiking. They'd just been in Colorado for the wildflower season and planned to go next to North Dakota to work a beet harvest. \"We just work different gigs and try to spend as much time outside as we can,\" he told me.</p><p>As the sky darkened, the water began to glitter. There are many things you can do with a paddle to create different patterns, but my favorite was plunging it in vertically and watching plumes of dense sparkles emanate from the shaft. I felt like Poseidon. We paddled to dark waters near the privately owned Dinner Island, where two gorgeous modernist homes sat. There the water was so full of light it was as if we'd entered another world. We saw flashes as fish passed beneath our kayaks, then a bright column that rose to the surface. It was a harbor seal cavorting around us. Rain fell for a few minutes; each drop transformed into light as it hit the water.</p><p>The scent of rain lingered as we paddled back. Kelly told us about being out with guests during the Perseid meteor shower, the drama downstairs matched by the fireworks above. \"There were a lot of sore necks,\" she recalled. Before we wrapped up, she took us to a secluded cove and pointed out the house where Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics legend, had once lived. \"I like to think,\" she said, \"that walking this land gave him the inspiration for some of the superheroes he created.\"</p><p>Besides the summer wildfires and ubiquitous burn bans, the biggest change I observed in the San Juans was to the ferry system. Actually, the ferries themselves-battered, hulking brutes, some dating to the Johnson administration, that glide ploddingly along the Puget Sound, their white masses contrasting with the blues and greens of the landscape-have scarcely changed at all. But the system, the largest in America, has grown increasingly decrepit and unreliable. \"I've exhausted myself reaching out to our senators and congresspeople, telling them, 'We have a problem here,' \" Karl Bruno told me. \"But it's hard to get noticed.\"</p><p>The system had been strained for years due to defunding of the Washington Department of Transportation and mandatory ship retirements, but worker attrition during the pandemic made things worse. And yet one could argue that there is a silver lining in all of this. The islands' inaccessibility has always been central to their charm, and a reason for their relative imperviousness to change. If you made the fleet bigger and faster, would the San Juans still be the San Juans? This is a place that is made for slowing down, getting away from it all, savoring the simple pleasures, having nowhere to be anytime soon. And we need these kinds of places more than ever these days.</p><p>After our last ferry ride, my family spent a few hours on Fidalgo Island, where my childhood hometown of Anacortes is located. We walked across Deception Pass Bridge, the magnificent set of cantilevered spans that soars over the strait separating Fidalgo from Whidbey Island, before heading down to Bowman Bay, where my mom said I'd kayaked for the first time, to stroll along one more rocky beach before driving to Seattle. My children swung pieces of bullwhip kelp that had washed ashore and discovered another driftwood assemblage, for which they began constructing an addition. You can find the best, perfectly round, flat skipping stones on these beaches, so we collected a bunch and I schooled them on technique. The sun was setting as I maneuvered the car out of the parking lot, feeling grateful that this northwestern corner of Washington is still a place that fresh generations of children come to, instantly make new best friends, and set about the important work of building forts and fairy houses.</p><h>stay</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAN JUAN ISLANDLakedale</emphasis></p><p>This property, 10 minutes from Friday Harbor, has grown up from its '60s roots as a hippie campground.

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused, but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with the commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to the complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggest the world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the China UAV Industry Alliance shows that there are 1,200 companies registered within the UAV and drone market in China. Of which, only 10% have established international links, with the Asia-Pacific, Oceania and US the predominant focus. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>As regulations governing the commercial use of drones become clearer both in China and internationally, sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, and transportation emerge as the primary areas with significant growth potential. The expansion of drone utilization in agriculture aligns with its prioritization in Made in China 2025 vision.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to the European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2025, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The US Air Force wants an additional $150 million on top of the $392 million previously appropriated for its drone wingmen effort. Autonomous aircraft are ideal for completing suicide missions and protecting pilots. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. In 2023, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>UK has unveiled its Future of Flight action plan aimed at introducing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in the skies by 2026. This plan outlines the integration of eVTOL services, projecting a significant boost of \u00a345 billion ($57.1 billion) to the national economy by 2030. The UK's The National Health Service has teamed up with private companies like Skyports Drone Services to prepare medical transport networks and other critical public operations.</p><p>UK's Defense Ministry announced the 'UK Defence Drone Strategy' and committed $5.7 billion towards the development of UAV technology in the country.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>France is investing \u20ac5 billion ($5.4 billion) in drones through 2030 as part of its military programming law. The goal is to develop a French loitering-munitions industry by the end of the decade and achieve swarm-flight capability. France has a target for the army to have 3,000 tactical drones by 2025. The French government is mainly looking to induct defense drones below 150 kg. Thales estimates the global market for drones of less than 150kg to be worth more than \u20ac2.5 billion, with growth rates of 14% per year.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $55.9 billion defense budget for fiscal 2024, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>South Korea has announced plan to double its military drone fleet by 2026 in the face of growing threats from North Korean unmanned aerial vehicles. Korea plans to increase the funding for weapon modernization programs to 5% of the total state budget, up from the current level of 1%.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in the military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield. Recently in August 2023, Indonesia announced plans to buy 12 Turkish military drones for $300 million.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while the hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>In April 2024, Zipline completed its one millionth commercial drone delivery. Zipline's autonomous drones have collectively flown over 70 million miles and delivered more than 10 million products across four continents. The company noted a notable surge in demand, prompting the recent enlargement of its Platform 2 (P2) system across the United States. This upgraded system will cater to additional partners, including Panera Bread, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Jet's Pizza, across various metropolitan regions like Seattle, Houston, and Detroit.</p><p>In January 2024, German UAV manufacturer and transport company Wingcopter announced the extension and expansion of its delivery project providing groceries to small, remote villages using drones.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In October 2023, Zipline announced a new partnership with healthcare giant Cleveland Clinic involving an evolving operation that will begin with drone delivery of medication directly to patients' homes. The aerial delivery of specialized medicines and prescriptions will be among the first uses of the partnership.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>In March 2024, Aerodyne Group announced that a cross-border drone delivery services between Malaysia and Singapore is being considered. The focus will be on critical deliveries such as urgent documents, high-value electronics, medical supplies, and perishable foods.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. In December 2023, the Texas city of Arlington announced plans to launch a trial using drones and robotic ground vehicles to deliver packages from a local food bank to recipient homes in a bid to reduce the number of vans and emissions.</p><p>Scotland has launched world's first nation-wide medical drone delivery network with the completion of its first live trial flight near Glasgow. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, clean, and relatively inexpensive aerial transportation network to spirit medicines, lab samples, and other supplies to facilities across the nation.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3         Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In October 2023, Japan's SkyDrive received 12.4 billion yen ($82.7 million) from the government of Japan to support the development of the startup's electric vertical takeoff and landing craft (eVTOL). In June 2023, defense and security UAV specialist group Red Cat Holdings raised $1.2 million in new funding to develop a new, portable UAV as standard issue equipment for soldiers. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to set up a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there have been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every newly produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has granted approval for Alphabet's Wing Aviation and Zipline International to concurrently operate their delivery drones above the Dallas and Fort Worth suburbs without the need for visual observers. Commencing in August 2024, these flights will represent the first instance of commercial drones operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) in the US, effectively overcoming a significant obstacle in drone delivery.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>In August 2024, DroneUp, a pioneering autonomous drone delivery firm in the United States, has set a new standard for the industry by successfully executing 500 deliveries in a single day. DroneUp set a new record with 40 deliveries per hour, each carrying up to 10 pounds.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects a greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Amazon is set to launch its drone delivery service in UK and Italy by the end of 2024. The expansion follows successful operations in the US, where the service has already delivered thousands of packages.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratories. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini-UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini-UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini-UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro-UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro-UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>Applications</p><p>Defens</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first-time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>Tank terminal operators in Germany are pivoting to drones for cost-effective and reliable tank roof inspections. The traditional method for inspecting floating roof tanks entails workers scaling tanks that are 25 meters tall to assess their condition. This process is both labor-intensive and poses significant risks for human error. Considering that tank terminals often house numerous tanks, carrying out manual inspections can be exceedingly time-consuming and hazardous.</p><p>Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying overcrowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector, despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hacking. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2.

The FY 2025 President's budget of $3.01 billion for CISA reflects our commitment to the DHS mission to safeguard our homeland, our values, and our way of life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As America's cyber defense agency and the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the cyber and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day. Securing our Nation's critical infrastructure is a shared responsibility requiring not just a whole-of-government, but a whole-of-nation approach. CISA is only able to accomplish our mission by building collaborative, trusted partnerships across all levels of government, the private sector, academia, and the international community.</p><p>I am honored to appear before this Sub-Committee to discuss how the President's budget for FY 2025 recognizes our essential role and provides necessary resources to achieve this mission. In FY 2025, CISA will remain focused on strengthening our Nation's cyber and physical defenses. A key component of our success will be our employees and I continue to be impressed with the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of the dedicated CISA workforce.</p><p>CISA plays two key operational roles in this mission. First, we are the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, charged with protecting and defending Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) networks, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the National Cyber Director, and agency Chief Information Officers and Chief Information Security Officers. CISA also leads asset response to significant cyber incidents in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Intelligence Community for threat response and intelligence support respectively.</p><p>Second, as the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, we work with Sector Risk Management Agencies and other federal partners; State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments; and industry to protect and defend the Nation's cyber and physical infrastructure from the full range of threats. We will continue to work closely with these partners to help protect our country's networks and critical infrastructure from the full range of threats through the timely sharing of actionable information, intelligence, and guidance with our partners and the public to ensure they have the tools they need to keep our communities safe and increase nationwide cybersecurity preparedness. The FY 2025 President's budget provides the resources needed to continue both of these broad efforts.</p><p>In particular, the FY 2025 President's budget includes $116 million in funding to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA). On April 4, 2024, the CIRCIA Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published for a 60-day public comment period. The final rule is required to be issued 18 months after the publication of the NPRM. CISA will need the FY 2025 investments in staffing, processes, and technology capabilities to utilize information provided pursuant to CIRCIA. FY 2025 will be a crucial year to strengthen and build CISA's capacity to receive, manage, analyze, secure, and report on incidents and ransom payments reported under CIRCIA, maturing our current ability to manage incidents, coordinate with and notify our interagency partners, and implement data protection requirements including additional staff to receive and route around-the-clock inbound reports as we prepare for the final rule to go into effect in FY 2026.</p><p>The FY 2025 President's budget includes $1.7 billion for the Cybersecurity Division (CSD) to continue to build the national capacity to detect, defend against, and build resilience to cyberattacks to our critical infrastructure. CISA will continue working with federal partners to bolster their cybersecurity and incident response postures, and safeguard federal networks. CISA will also continue partnering with the private sector and SLTT governments to detect and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities to our nation's critical infrastructure before they are exploited.</p><p>The budget provides $394 million to support the Joint Collaborative Environment (JCE) tools and capabilities to facilitate the ingestion and integration of data as well as orchestrate and automate the analysis of data that supports the rapid identification, detection, mitigation, and prevention of malicious cyber activity. The JCE will serve as an important mechanism to integrate and exchange operational data, information, analysis, analytics, and threat intelligence, regardless of sector or industry. As part of the JCE, the budget includes $384 million for the Cyber Analytics Data System (CADS). CADS will provide a modern, scalable, unclassified analytic infrastructure for CISA's cyber operators, while strengthening CISA's ability to improve cyber threat visibility, promote streamlined analytics, and ultimately drive action to mitigate risks. CADS capabilities will ingest data from a myriad of sources, apply robust automation and analytics, and provide CISA's cybersecurity teams with access to analytical results, threat insights, and detailed visualization with capabilities to share results and mitigations in real time.</p><p>The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program remains an invaluable tool for rapidly deploying protection to federal agencies, resulting in increased operational visibility and an ability to defend against threats both at the agency and federal enterprise levels. The budget requests $470 million for CDM to increase CISA's invaluable operational visibility inside agency networks that helps drive targeted and enterprise-wide cybersecurity improvement actions. Many intrusions are enabled by known exploited vulnerabilities. Using our CDM program and our vulnerability scanning tools, CISA identified and drove mitigation of over 15 million severe vulnerabilities across the federal government in FY 2023.</p><p>Halfway through FY 2024, CISA has made progress in Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) deployment across sixteen agencies. These technologies give CISA an unsurpassed level of visibility into threats and incidents targeting federal networks, allowing faster detection, and, using authorities recently provided by Congress, we can now assist agencies in responding to cyber events in minutes rather than days or weeks. A total of eight agencies have fully completed EDR deployments, with an additional five agencies making substantial progress. CISA will continue to overcome agency-specific hurdles ranging from resource challenges to agencies opting for longer timeframes to complete deployment. In the first two quarters of FY 2024, CISA has successfully detected 1,924 threats on federal networks using EDR capabilities and is actively working to expand this program to all federal agencies.\"</p><p>The budget additionally includes $255 million to deliver risk reduction services locally to CISA stakeholders in their community. As of April 1st, 2024, the Integrated Operations Division (IOD) has delivered over 27,000 risk reduction services across all 50 states. Risk reduction services include security assessments, entity notifications, security assist visits, tabletop exercises, information exchanging round tables, and webinars that leverage CISA's expertise in cyber, physical, chemical, communications, and elections security. IOD separately coordinates CISA operations at the headquarters and regional level to warn entities of imminent cyberattacks and help them to prepare for and respond to incidents that impact critical infrastructure. As part of our Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative, CISA made over 1,200 notifications to critical infrastructure owners and operators throughout the Nation in FY 2023 that were on the verge of having their data encrypted by ransomware attackers, avoiding the attacks due to CISA's rapid intervention. Additionally, IOD provides intelligence context to support decision making, performs Agency-designated Emergency Support Functions, and monitors and disseminates cyber and physical risk and threat information to CISA stakeholders 24/7/365.</p><p>The budget includes $187 million for infrastructure security and resilience for CISA's efforts to enhance critical infrastructure protection through enabling risk-informed decision-making by owners and operators of critical infrastructure, as well as Federal and SLTT partners. CISA's Infrastructure Security Division (ISD) leads and coordinates national programs and policies on critical infrastructure security and resilience, including analyzing critical infrastructure and key dependencies, developing and conducting vulnerability assessments, developing guidance methodologies and risk management courses of actions, collaborating with the Department of Defense on assessing critical homeland defense plans, facilitating exercises, chairing the Interagency Security Committee and leading/coordinating the associated security for Federal facilities, providing training and technical assistance, and assisting state and local authorities in implementing and evaluating progress toward reducing risks and enhancing resilience. Thus far in FY 2024, ISD has delivered a total of 86 exercises to critical infrastructure sectors across 27 states and territories, in addition to 26 national or multi-jurisdictional exercises, reducing risk to critical infrastructure by identifying lessons learned and best practices that each sector can draw upon for future preparedness and security investments, enhancements, and developments. Approximately 92% of exercise participants state that the exercise resulted in enhanced preparedness and 94% state they will take steps to enhance preparedness based on the results of the exercise. In addition to exercises, ISD has delivered 146 infrastructure security and resilience assessments across 35 states and territories.</p><p>ISD also focuses on reducing the risk of targeted violence directed at our schools, communities, houses of worship, and other public gathering locations. In addition, ISD leads efforts to secure our Nation's chemical infrastructure through implementation of ChemLock which is a voluntary chemical security program created as a supplement to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) and targeted at those facilities that were not determined to be high-risk under the CFATS regulation. The budget also proposes to reauthorize the CFATS program and includes funding for the program. With the expiration of CFATS authorities, CISA can no longer require security measures at the more than 3,200 high-risk chemical facilities across the nation, can no longer accept facility chemical inventories and conduct risk assessments at an estimated 330 new facilities coming into possession of chemicals, has missed more than 1,300 inspections at these high-risk facilities of which 35% of the inspections typically reveal a security gap, and can no longer vet individuals with access to dangerous chemicals against the terrorist screening database - of which CISA estimates more than 70,000 individuals have gained access without these critical checks. This reauthorization will increase the security of our nation's chemical infrastructure.</p><p>The budget includes $130 million for emergency communications to ensure interoperability and to assist Federal and SLTT stakeholders. CISA's Emergency Communications Division (ECD) enhances public safety communications at all levels of government across the country through training, coordination, tools, and guidance. ECD leads the development of the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) and 56 Statewide Communications Interoperability Plans to maximize the use of all communications capabilities--voice, video, and data--available to emergency responders and ensure the security of data exchange. ECD provides priority access capabilities for voice, video, data and information services in the Next Generation Networks Priority Services (NGN-PS) program which are used by all branches of the federal government as well as many public and private sector critical infrastructure owners and operators. This investment in NGN-PS enhances continuity of operations and the ability of the national security and emergency preparedness community to communicate and assist local emergency responders to communicate over commercial networks during natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other significant disruptive events. As of April 1st, 2024, CISA has over 1,330,000 stakeholders enrolled into the service. NGN-PS enables essential personnel to communicate when networks are degraded or congested. Priority communications are crucial to the continuity of operations when facing adverse conditions or incidents. CISA is focused on increasing access to its priority services among eligible personnel across all critical infrastructure sectors. Finally, ECD supports nationwide sharing of best practices and lessons learned through SAFECOM and Emergency Communications Preparedness Center governance bodies.</p><p>The budget includes $98 million for Stakeholder Engagement Division (SED) activities focused on fostering collaboration, coordination, and a culture of shared responsibility for national critical infrastructure risk management with Federal, SLTT, and private sector partners in the United States, as well as international partners. With this funding, SED will continue to execute CISA's role as the National Coordinator and as the Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) for eight of the Nation's sixteen critical infrastructure sectors. In these roles, CISA ensures a coordinated approach to risk management for securing critical infrastructure that addresses the full spectrum of risks. CISA leads, organizes, and coordinates cybersecurity and infrastructure security actions across SRMAs and the federal government, collaborating between government and industry, and convening and sharing information with SLTT private-sector entities. For example, SED has conducted more than 25 engagements with industry, U.S. Government partners, and international stakeholders to understand AI-driven threats within the national security space. In partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), CISA will continue implementing the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, including providing subject matter expertise and leading program evaluation efforts to ensure state and local entities can access grant resources to enhance cybersecurity resiliency and reduce cybersecurity risk. CISA will also bring awareness to stakeholders, including the general public and small and medium-sized businesses, on steps they can take to keep themselves, their families, friends, and their customers more safe and secure online. For example, CISA's Secure Our World public awareness program received more than a billion total impressions and has been re-shared thousands of times across various demographics, languages, and social media channels. We will help to grow the cyber workforce by working with K-12, universities, and community colleges.</p><p>Additionally, recognizing that much of the U.S. critical infrastructure interconnects and is interdependent with foreign assets, systems, or networks, CISA will continue its efforts alongside the Department of State to strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure by engaging international partners and allies to build situational awareness and capacity, facilitate operational collaboration, promote effective infrastructure risk management globally, and develop and promote international security and resilience. Working with international partners to reduce risk to our critical dependencies will allow us to set conditions for success in cooperation, competition, and conflict. CISA also manages key national, Presidential, and departmental committees, councils, and boards, including the Cyber Safety Review Board and CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee, to provide decision makers at all levels of government with recommendations and guidance to meaningfully improve the safety, security, and resilience of the critical infrastructure that we depend on every day.</p><p>Finally, the budget also includes $140 million for the National Risk Management Center (NRMC). The NRMC develops risk analytic products to inform decisions across all types of risks and all critical infrastructure sectors. These analytic products support investment and operational decision making throughout the public and private sectors. The budget provides continued funding for two vital efforts.</p><p>First, the funding will allow us to expand risk analysis and risk management across all critical infrastructure sectors. Work in this area includes efforts such as the FY 2024 risk analyses associated with the impacts of AI-use across critical infrastructure sectors and potential mitigation strategies. Additionally, CISA generates Infrastructure of Concern (IOC) lists for partners such as CISA's Regional Field Offices and FEMA. These lists are generated in response to multiple hazards such as a hurricane or a forest fire and prioritize critical infrastructure assets across all sectors likely to be impacted. In doing so, local authorities are informed in their mitigation and response planning. For example, the NRMC maintains an All-Hazards Analysis dataset (AHA), which is a dataset that captures both assets, systems, and the connections between them. CISA used this dataset in support of an FAA request to show the reliance of particular airports on common infrastructure outside of the transportation sector.</p><p>Second, the budget also provides funding to maintain analytic capabilities, including risk methodology and framework development to identify critical infrastructure interdependencies and cascading consequences. For instance, NRMC utilized a tool--called CASCADE, which is part of our Suite of Tools for the Analysis of Risk (STAR) when the State of Florida reported an issue with Lee County Utilities Water System due to extensive pipe breaks preventing water flow/pressure in the system. We have created a visualization depicting potential cascading impacts on hospitals and other critical infrastructure assets, which enabled partners to quickly identify additional key assets at risk. One practical example includes CISA's utilization of STAR/Cascade to evaluate KinderMorgan and the California-Nevada (CAL-NEV) Pipeline and their potential for cascading consequences to disruption of pipeline.</p><p>Again, I am honored to represent my dedicated teammates at CISA who work tirelessly in support of our mission to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our cyber and physical infrastructure. The risks we face are complex, geographically dispersed, and affect a diverse array of our stakeholders, including federal agencies, private sector companies, SLTT governments, and ultimately the American people. The FY 2025 President's budget requests the funding necessary for CISA to carry out these critical missions.</p><p>In closing, I would like to take a moment to recognize this Committee's strong support for CISA. For myself, and on behalf of our CISA workforce, thank you for your support. We will continue to operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner. There is much to be done and I look forward to working with you to continue strengthening this Agency, and by extension, the security and resilience of the United States. Thank you and I look forward to your questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP15/20240430/117210/HHRG-118-AP15-Wstate-EasterlyJ-20240430.pdf\">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP15/20240430/117210/HHRG-118-AP15-Wstate-EasterlyJ-20240430.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC430425M7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXS-X451-DYVR-P294-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 30, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"PM is one of major pollutants emitted from forest fires. High PM concentration not only affects short-term human respiration health, but also poses a long-term threat to human cardiopulmonary functionality.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China, Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province.<br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University, \"Therefore, it is of great importance to quantitatively assess the PM released by forest combustion in forest fire studies. In this study we examine relationships between the PM concentration and environment and fuel characteristics laboratory experiments. In the experiments, fuel beds with controlled moisture contents and loads were first built; then 144 ignition experiments were conducted for various combinations of wind speeds using a wind tunnel device. Fire behavior characteristics and PM concentrations released from fuel combustion were measured and analyzed. The experimental results show that the relationship between fire characteristics, fire intensity and the influencing factors of wind speed, fuel moisture content, and fuel load can be explained by the fundamental theory of forest combustion. Although PM concentration rises with the increase of wind speed, the decrease of fuel moisture content, and the increase of fuel load, there appears to be a fuel load threshold for a given combination of wind speed and fuel moisture content that the increase of PM concentration decelerates quickly after the load passes the threshold value. After screening fire behavior characteristics that affect PM concentration, we found that fire line intensity and flame width are the ones with the strongest association with the concentration. With flame width as independent variable, we have built two regression models to predict PM and fire line intensity which are treated as dependent variable; the models have high accuracy with R = 0.92 for predicting PM and R = 0.97 for predicting fire line intensity.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Study results can be used as reference to protect the health of forest fire fighters, and can be helpful for forest fire smoke management.\"<br/> This research has been peer-reviewed.<br/> For more information on this research see: Effect of fire spread, flame characteristic, fire intensity on particulate matter 2.5 released from surface fuel combustion of Pinus koraiensis plantation- A laboratory simulation study. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Environment International</emphasis>, 2022;166:107352. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Environment International</emphasis> can be contacted at: Pergamon-elsevier Science Ltd, The Boulevard, Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford OX5 1GB, England.

Exposure has also been associated with increased risks of heart attack, lung cancer, stroke and cognitive decline.</p><p>\"The advice to limit strenuous activities is because when your respiratory rate is higher, you inhale more particulates,\" said Yale Medicine's Dr. Carrie Redlich on the Yale Medicine website. The tiny particles from the smoke \"get everywhere through the bloodstream and trigger inflammatory pathways, which can exacerbate a number of underlying cardiac and respiratory conditions.\"</p><p>Redlich said the best kind of mask to wear to protect yourself from the poor air quality that comes with wildfire smoke is an N95 or P100.</p><p>According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, 904 active fires were burning across Canada on Monday, with 587 out of control and 203 under control.

The \"Training on Wildfire Risk Reduction and Landscape Fire Management in the Shar/\u00c5\u00a0ara Mountains and Korab Massif Area\" included also a field exercise on forest fire suppression in Mavrovo, North Macedonia.</p><p>This was followed by the OSCE's \"Training on Fire Early Warning in the Shar/\u00c5\u00a0ara Mountains and Korab Massif Area\" on 12 October in Skopje, organized in collaboration with GFMC, RFMC, and the Crisis Management Center of North Macedonia. The representatives of the four protected areas were trained on early warning systems for wildfire risk assessment and risk-informed decision-making.</p><p>Both trainings aimed to strengthen local capacities and foster co-operation in tackling wildfire risks in the shared hotspot of the Shar/S\u00cc\u0152ara Mountains and Korab Massif area, a biodiversity hotspot with outstanding natural value in South-Eastern Europe. They marked the launching of the pilot initiative \"Fire Resilient Protected Areas: Shar/\u00c5\u00a0ara Mountains and Korab Massif Area\" within the framework of the joint co-operation strategy on climate change and security and its implementation plan that was developed by the OSCE in partnership with adelphi and GFMC through a consultation process that brought together all local stakeholders.</p><p>\"The Shar/\u00c5\u00a0ara Mountains and Korab Massif Area is highly vulnerable to fires due to the accelerated pace of climate change,\" said Nikola Nikolov, Head of the RFMC. \"Establishing efficient means for early warning, communication and exchange of information and experiences between local practitioners is key to preventing and effectively responding to fires in this shared nature reserve. These trainings are the first steps in this direction,\" he added.</p><p>\"Disaster risk reduction and tackling climate-related risks are an integral part of OSCE's comprehensive approach to security,\" said Esra Buttanri, Senior Climate Change Adviser at the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities (OCEEA). \"Through our extrabudgetary project on climate change and security, we are facilitating regional co-operation to prevent, prepare for, and jointly respond to wildfires aggravated by climate change. In this work, we are guided by theOSCE Ministerial Council Decision on climate changeadopted in Stockholm in 2021 and theOSCE Ministerial Council Decision on disaster risk reductionadopted in Basel in 2014. The results of this work were prominent during the discussions at the OSCE High-Level Conference on Climate Change that was hosted by the OSCE Secretary General this year on 7 July in Vienna.\"</p><p>Johann Georg Goldammer, Director of the GFMC, said: \"The large wildfires that we are witnessing across the globe and in the OSCE area are a result of higher temperatures, increasing occurrence and severity of droughts, and increased arid conditions due to climate change. These fires, in turn, contribute to the destruction of carbon sinks and net release of large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating global warming. Tackling these complex challenges and enhancing the resilience of our natural and cultural landscapes to climate extremes and wildfires require co-operation at all levels. Our longstanding partnership with the OSCE to promote regional co-operation in this field contributes to broader international efforts for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction\"</p><p>The OSCE has been promoting regional co-operation to tackle climate-related risks through fire management also in the South Caucasus through two bilateral processes between Armenia and Georgia and Azerbaijan and Georgia. Most recently, the OSCE, in partnership with adelphi and GFMC, published aScoping Studythat analyses the current context of wildfire risk reduction, landscape fire management, and transboundary co-operation in Northern Armenia and Southern Georgia. The Scoping Study for bilateral co-operation in North-West Azerbaijan and North-East Georgia is in progress. The OSCE and GFMC are also partnering to strengthen climate resilience in Central Asia and Mongolia through promoting co-operation on fire management.</p><p>These activities are being conducted within the framework of the OSCE extra-budgetary project\"Strengthening responses to security risks from climate change in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia\", which is implemented by OCEEA in partnership with adelphi and funded by Andorra, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126188082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CT-RTR1-DYTH-G0S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 12, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With today's decision, we want to secure EU funding for firefighting aeroplanes and helicopters.</p><p>- Carl-Oskar Bohlin, Swedish Minister for Civil Defence</p><p>* * *</p><p>rescEU</p><p>In 2019, rescEU was created as a reserve of European civil protection capacities which would step in to help member states protect citizens when disasters - such as wildfires - occur. These capacities will include a fleet of firefighting planes and helicopters.</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition until the full availability of the rescEU firefighting fleet, the Commission can, for a transitional period until 31 December 2024, provide financing to member states to ensure rapid access to their national aerial firefighting capacities.</p><p>Because the purchase of highly-specialised aircrafts cannot be completed before the end of 2024, the transition period to lease forest fire planes and helicopters has to be extended until end of 2027.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quick adoption</p><p>The Council is concerned about the increasing wildfire risk and the development that wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense. This requires the swift prolongation of the transition period - to ensure that sufficient aerial firefighting capacities will continue to be rapidly available also beyond the 2024 wildfire season. Therefore the Council decided to align its position with that of the Commission's and calls on the European Parliament to cooperate in view of a swift adoption.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>The wildfire risk in the EU is growing and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense. In 2022, the number of wildfires in the EU bigger than 30 hectares totalled 2 707. 786 316 hectares (over three times the size of Luxembourg) of land were burnt.

According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"The forest fuel load influences the spreading rate and fire intensity during a forest fire. However, the mechanism of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation that affects the spatial distribution of the forest fuel load remains unclear.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"In this study, live (tree, herbaceous, and shrub) and dead fuel loads (litter and humus) were estimated based on the plot investigation results of 4 typical stands (Pinus massoniana, Platycladus orientalis, Ficus microcarpa, and Cinnamomum camphora) in Chongqing, China. The results demonstrated that the tree, shrub, herbaceous, litter, and humus fuel loads of the 4 typical stands were 66.92 to 118.54 Mg/ha, 2.93 to 4.04 Mg/ha, 0.77 to 1.01 Mg/ha, 0.90 to 1.39 Mg/ha, and 1.49 to 1.98 Mg/ha, respectively. The forest fuel load varied significantly among the different stands. The Mantel test revealed that the forest fuel load had significantly positive correlations with the geospatial distance and stand environment but no significant correlation with the topographic factor. Additionally, the redundancy analysis demonstrated that the stand factors, canopy density and average canopy height, and the topographic factor, altitude, had significant impacts on the forest fuel load. The variance partitioning analysis revealed that the spatial heterogeneity of the forest fuel load was mainly attributed to the covariation of environmental and spatial factors (29.55%).\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Moreover, the geospatial distance was a dominant independent factor for the fuel distribution (14.66%), followed by the stand environment (9.51%) and topographic factor (0.35%). In summary, the spatial distribution of the forest fuel load was dependent on niche-based and random processes, and dispersal limitation was the dominant factor.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Dispersal Limitation Dominates the Spatial Distribution of Forest Fuel Loads in Chongqing, China.

But according to new research led by Volker Radeloff, a professor of forest and wildlife ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison, in the United States, the largest areas near humans burned by wildfires are grass and shrublands, not forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The study was published in the journal Science recently.</p><p>Radeloff has studied the areas where people and wildlands meet for years. Known as the Wildland Urban Interface, or WUI, these areas cover about 10% of land in the United States but are home to about one-third of the population. The WUI (pronounced \"woo-ee\") was initially a tool used by the U.S. Forest Service to assist with wildfire management in the western U.S.</p><p>The WUI can consist of a wide range of wildland vegetation such as trees, shrubs, grasses, wetland plants, mangroves, moss and lichen. Each type of vegetation requires different management techniques, as they regenerate after fire differently and are affected by environmental factors like precipitation in unique ways.</p><p>As Radeloff explains, many people enjoy living in these places because they like to be near the amenities of nature. But these areas are also hot spots for environmental conflicts like wildfires, the spread of diseases from animals, habitat fragmentation and loss of biodiversity.</p><p>In regions with growing populations, such as the American sunbelt, more human development is expanding the WUI. Add to that a changing climate with warmer, drier conditions, and the likelihood rises that wildfires will affect humans more frequently.</p><p>\"Texas is now the state with the largest increase in the number of WUI houses. California had that distinction for a long time,\" Radeloff says.</p><p>While the total area burned by grass and shrubland fires is much larger than forest fires, grass and shrublands are also much more widespread than forests. They burn and move faster than forests, meaning grassland fires can spread to a larger number of homes than a forest fire might.</p><p>Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and NASA, and with support from the U.S. Forest Service, Radeloff and his team built data sets that show where wildfires burned homes and indicate if those homes were rebuilt.</p><p>The wildland-urban interface (WUI) in 2020 across the conterminous US, and changes in WUI area from 1990 to 2020 near Los Angeles (a), San Antonio (b), and Atlanta (c). Image courtesy of Volker Radeloff</p><p>The researchers found that the risk of wildfire in any kind of WUI vegetation is not deterring the development and rebuilding of homes in areas that have burned in the past.</p><p>That's especially concerning for homes in grassland and shrubland because the vegetation, which can become fuel for fire, recovers much more quickly than a forest would. That means there's more fuel for a fire to burn again in the same grass and shrubland area more frequently.</p><p>The issue is not a lack of homeowner knowledge, Radeloff explains. People who choose to live in these areas often know the risk of fire exists, he says, but it's a risk they're willing to take. Whether they feel a connection to the land, a desire to live near a beautiful vista or choose to rebuild in a location that already has electricity and plumbing running to it, people still choose to live in areas at risk of burning.</p><p>\"It is usually much easier to stay in the same place to build a house,\" Radeloff says. \"Getting houses rebuilt, businesses reestablished quickly, is important. So, to just pack up and go is really hard for a community to do and happens quite rarely.\"</p><p>There are ways homeowners can harden their homes against fire, though, and Radeloff believes learning from the homes that don't burn would be a step in the right direction for people that choose to rebuild after a fire.</p><p>The map on the left compares grassland to forest land in states across the US. On the right, is a map that indicates buildings exposed to wildfire organized by the kind of WUI vegetation across the United States. Image courtesy of Volker Radeloff</p><p>However, Radeloff says this burden shouldn't be entirely on the homeowner. He believes there is room for policymakers to influence how prepared a community is and where zoning should allow new housing developments.</p><p>\"As a country, we've learned not to build extensively in floodplains. We should do something similar for wildfires as well,\" he says.</p><p>Helping various policymakers at all levels of government understand the difference between how grasslands and forests burn differently, or that different vegetation types all require different management approaches, could help inform better policy.</p><p>Ensuring that a community at risk has an established evacuation plan and a clear notification system for evacuation is another area for improvement Radeloff sees, especially in places where these wildfires are more likely to increase. He says that a better notification system and evacuation plans could have helped reduce the toll of the recent fires that burned the town of Lahaina in Hawaii.</p><p>\"That doesn't stop the loss of homes, but it stops the loss of life,\" he says.</p><p>As the world continues to warm, understanding the expanding areas where humans and wildlands meet will be increasingly important. Using data sets like those Radeloff and his team produced can help homeowners and policymakers know what risks may be coming and where how they can better prepare for them.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.wisc.edu/grass-and-shrublands-burn-more-land-and-homes-than-forest-fires\">https://news.wisc.edu/grass-and-shrublands-burn-more-land-and-homes-than-forest-fires</url>/</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8362811 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8362811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KX-FG21-JC11-11WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><timeReceived>9:48 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 10, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Smoke from the wildfires has lowered curtains of haze on broad swaths of Canada and the United States, pushing into southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and moving into parts of West Virginia. Canadian officials say it is the nation's worst wildfire season ever and they expect air quality to remain a concern through the summer, as long as the fires continue. </p><p>It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said. Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist Steven Flisfeder said smoke will drift across Quebec and Ontario over the next few days, and that air quality will deteriorate as a result. \"As long as the fires are burning and the smoke is in the atmosphere, it is going to be a concern not just for Canadians but Americans as well,\" Flisfeder said. Flisfeder said the smoky, hazy skies will persist unless rainfall provides sufficient help to firefighters in controlling the blazes. \"It's important to note that the highest amounts of rain were not received in those areas where most active forest fires are,\" Flisfeder said. The Detroit area woke up Wednesday to some of the worst air quality in the United States as smoke from Canada's wildfires settled over most of the Great Lakes region and unhealthy haze spread southward, as far as Missouri and Kentucky. Meanwhile, NASA is reporting that smoke from wildfires in northern Quebec has reached Europe. The American space agency said satellite imagery from Monday showed smoke extending across the North Atlantic Ocean to the Iberian Peninsula, France and other parts of Western Europe. There are 490 fires burning nationally, with 255 of them considered to be out of control. Quebec's forest fire prevention agency is reporting 110 active fires. Canada has already surpassed the record for area burned. Nearly every province in Canada has fires burning. A record 30,000 square miles of Canada has burned, an area nearly as large as South Carolina, according to the Canadian government. \"This season has been unprecedented,\" Flisfeder said. Ontario's chief medical officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, suggested people get into the daily habit of checking air quality this summer. \"That's our new normal now is to be looking at all of those parameters,\" Moore said. The hazy skies and acrid air were obvious in Canada's largest city of Toronto, where child care centers and the school board suspended outdoor activities. Almost 1,200 vulnerable people from Cree communities are among the evacuees who have fled northern Quebec because of wildfires and smoke. Dr. Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Pr\u00c3\u00a9vost of the Cree health board said the evacuation process has gone relatively well, but he adds that the situation poses particular health, logistical and cultural challenges.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001890778dc05a1f9477f3d790000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68T6-P221-JBSK-R35W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With an increase in extreme climate-related weather events worldwide, including Canada's record spring forest fire season this year, the urgency of the situation calls for more ambition and international cooperation on climate action to keep the 1.5C Paris Agreement warming limit within reach and avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, concluded his participation in the seventh Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) in Brussels, Belgium. Canada, along with His Excellency Huang Runqiu, Minister of Ecology and Environment of China, and Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal (European Commission), co-convened the two days of meetings with over 29 ministers and other high-level representatives, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, and 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) President-designate Dr. Sultan Al Jaber from the United Arab Emirates, to agree on priorities to increase international momentum in the lead-up to COP28.</p><p>At MoCA, participating ministers shared expectations for COP28, including the need to keep global warming to 1.5C within reach and to work together to support people and communities everywhere who are experiencing severe impacts as a result of the climate crisis. Canada stressed the need for new and enhanced concrete actions to reduce emissions, its commitment to an inclusive approach to addressing climate change, the importance of establishing a fund and funding arrangements for loss and damage at COP28, as well as its commitment to make climate and biodiversity action mutually reinforcing following the historic adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework during COP15. Canada came to Brussels ready to demonstrate and deliver on an ambitious outcome.</p><p>The Minister also announced $450 million in new funding for the second replenishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), a 50 percent increase from Canada's pledge to the GCF's first replenishment in 2019. The GCF is a critical funding mechanism of the Paris Agreement to support low-emission, climate-resilient development pathways. Minister Guilbeault encouraged other countries to follow Canada's contribution to the GCF, which will further strengthen its ability to respond to the climate crisis and is part of the collective US$100 billion climate finance goal, which is on track to be achieved this year and through to 2025.</p><p>During MoCA, the Minister collaborated with his co-conveners from China and the EU. The Minister also strengthened relationships with representatives of several countries, including Singapore's Minister of Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu; German State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action, Jennifer Morgan; and the United Kingdom's Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero, Graham Stuart. Furthermore, the Minister hosted a roundtable discussion with youth, environmental non-governmental organizations, think tanks, and leading business organizations on the clean energy transition and our shared climate priorities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126021620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PH-XFK1-DYTH-G03W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 14, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By late Thursday, more than 300,000 utility customers were without power in Illinois and Indiana, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://poweroutage.us/\">PowerOutage.us</url>. </p><p>A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect Thursday afternoon in Illinois and parts of Indiana ahead of the system.</p><p>The storm was expected to move east through Illinois, Indiana and possibly into Kentucky, then dissipate Thursday evening. It was expected to bring wind gusts that could be stronger than hurricane-force - 74 mph - at times.</p><p>The Storm Prediction Center was forecasting a level 4 out of 5 risk for damaging winds up to 90 mph, along with large hail and a few tornadoes for nearly 2 million people across Central Illinois.</p><p>Satellite imagery shared on social media by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed lightning flashing in the dangerous storm over Illinois, along with a separate storm system moving south through Kentucky and Tennessee.</p><p>The bow-echo thunderstorm complex appeared to meet the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/AbtDerechos/derechofacts.htm\">definition of a derecho</url>: a destructive arc of thunderstorms characterized by dangerous, widespread winds. The straight-line winds in these weather phenomena can be just as devastating as tornadoes. </p><p>A derecho must maintain a path of wind damage that is 60 miles wide and 400 miles long, while also producing wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along most of its length.</p><p>As the storm plowed through Illinois, it cleared out some of the harmful wildfire smoke that has prompted air quality alerts for more than a third of the US population this week. Air pollution readings for small particulate matter - or PM 2.5, a hazardous air pollutant - dropped significantly behind the storm.</p><p>The air quality index in Champaign, Illinois, dropped from around 180, or \"unhealthy,\" on Thursday morning to just 1 after the storm blew through.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Map: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://\"/></p><p>The worst air pollution on Thursday was centered over Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cleveland. Some improvement in air quality was expected Friday, and Thursday's windy storms will help ease the pollution.</p><p>The smoke is pouring into the US from Canada, which is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record. Hundreds of fires are burning there, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, and parts of Canada, too, are experiencing unhealthy air quality from the fires, according to data from IQair.         </p><p>             CNN's Dave Hennen and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
