Thank you to them. European solidarity is at work!\" President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. <br/>\"Across the country over 10,000 firefighters and security forces are mobilised against the flames... These soldiers of fire are our heroes,\" he said. <br/>In total, 361 foreign firefighters were dispatched to assist their 1,100 French colleagues deployed in the worst-hit part of the French southwest. <br/>A first contingent of 65 German firefighters, followed by their 24 vehicles, arrived Thursday afternoon and were to go into action at dawn Friday, officials said. <br/>Among eight major fires currently raging, the biggest is the Landiras fire in the southwest Gironde department, whose forests and beaches draw huge tourist crowds each summer. <br/>It had already burned 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) in July -- the driest month seen in France since 1961 -- before being contained, but it continued to smoulder in the region's tinder-dry pine forests and peat-rich soil. <br/>Since flaring up again Tuesday, which officials suspect may have been caused by arson, it has burned 7,400 hectares, destroyed or damaged 17 homes, and forced 10,000 people to quit their homes, said Lieutenant Colonel Arnaud Mendousse of the Gironde fire and rescue service. <br/>Borne said nine firefighting planes are already dumping water on the blaze, with two more to be in service by the weekend. <br/>\"We battled all night to stop the fire from spreading, notably to defend the village of Belin-Beliet,\" Mendousse told journalists in Hostens. <br/>On several houses nearby, people hung out white sheets saying: \"Thank you for saving our homes\" and other messages of support for the weary fire battalions. <br/>\"You'd think we're in California, it's gigantic... And they're used to forest fires here but we're being overwhelmed on all sides -- nobody could have expected this,\" Remy Lahlay, a firefighter deployed near Hostens in the Landes de Gascogne natural park, told AFP. <br/>With temperatures in the region hitting nearly 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) Thursday and forecast to stay high until at least Sunday, \"there is a very serious risk of new outbreaks\" for the Landiras fire, the prefecture of the Gironde department said. <br/>Acrid smoke has spread across much of the southwestern Atlantic coast and its beaches that draw huge crowds of tourists each summer, with the regional ARS health agency \"strongly\" urging people to wear protective face masks. <br/>The smoke also forced the closing of the A63 motorway, a major artery toward Spain, between Bordeaux and Bayonne. <br/>The government has urged employers to allow leaves of absence for volunteer firefighters to help fight the fires. <br/>It has already burned 10,000 hectares, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767166023813959425976100157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664J-N501-F03R-N553-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>5:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

This is to reduce hazardous fuels, improve critical winter habitat for mule deer and watershed restoration.</p><p>This project is being implemented in partnership with Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Total project area in all locations will be 2,606 acres. The thinning will begin the week of October 13th and will be completed before spring of 2022.</p><p>Hand crews will lop and scatter the juniper on site which can be collected for firewood with a permit from the Logan Ranger District office.</p><p>By using a mechanical treatment to selectively thin juniper stands it will reduce hazardous fuels and encourage growth of forbs, grasses, and shrubs. This will also maintain beneficial shrub cover and perennial grasses in the treatment area, increase soil moisture during the growing season, which can be captured by grasses and flowering plants like forbs as they grow to re-claim and diversify the site, and will help improve big game winter and summer habitats. Action taken now will help maintain these habitats for the future. Similar projects will be completed this year in Lefthand Fork, Blacksmith Fork and in areas along the Ant Flat road. This type of project will be implemented in Logan Canyon over the next few years.</p><p>Contact: KJ Pollock, 801/558-8016, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kathy.pollock@usda.gov\">kathy.pollock@usda.gov</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7632509 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7632509</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63VB-1MH1-JC11-1507-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"277\"/><timeReceived>7:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 14, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm Andrew Tsai, Senior Biotech analyst here at Jefferies, thank you for joining us. Next up is Avadel. To the right of me, Greg Divis, CEO, to the right of him, Richard Kim, Chief Commercial Officer and to the right of Richard, great, sorry Tom -- Tom McHugh, CFO my apologies. Welcome all of you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you. Appreciate being here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. So I guess to help the audience here level set the Avadel story, maybe really quickly you know LUMRYZ was just FDA approved for narcolepsy, you launched in June 2023. So maybe talk about why LUMRYZ is differentiated and why it has meaningful sales potential in your view?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, maybe I'll start and then Rich turn over to you, we just announced our Q3 results last week, really pleased with where we are at the launch. We announced over a thousand patients enrolled into our our rise up program, which is akin to initiating a potential treatment or a start for a patient and during Q3 we announced that during that quarter, we put 400 patients on therapy. So early days, but we're really pleased with the foundation we're building right now in terms of where the launch sits and maybe in terms of differentiation and where we said, I'll turn it to you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, when we think about the Narcolepsy marketplace, it's maybe good to start at the beginning. The disease itself disrupts nocturnal sleep in about two-thirds of people with Narcolepsy. The approved therapy before LUMRYZ, the majority of them have a side effect of creating insomnia with stimulants and weight promoting agents. And the one product that didn't, actually the first generation oxybates forces patients to wake up during the middle of the night to take a second dose. So with LUMRYZ, we have the opportunity to not only address excessive day time sleepiness in cataplexy, but also do that without disrupting the sleep -- disrupting the night, like first generation oxybates do. So you get the full therapy dose in one dose. And like I said, you don't have to disrupt sleep, which is what the FDA partially had given us our orphan drug exclusivity based off of as well.</p><p>Now when you think about the marketplace today, the oxybate marketplace for Narcolepsy is about $1.8 billion in the US. That's based off about 16,000 patients who are currently on therapy. We also sort of see the marketplace in addition to the 16,000 patients of about 15,000 patients who have previously discontinued treatment, who are potentially eligible for oxybates again and up towards about 25,000 patients who are technically eligible for an oxybate. Today, there's about 3000 annual new start. So we really see LUMRYZ is having a great opportunity in each of those three segments as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And just to be clear, you have an orphan drug exclusivity for this drug. And so if someone were to ask you, is this differentiated from Xywav, which is a low sodium version, what would you say?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>But I guess to get into details there, once again, if you go back to the fundamentals, so the mixed salt version clearly has lower sodium content, but we've also had the twice-nightly sodium oxybate that's been on the market for more than 20 years, where there was really never a problem before a couple of years ago. We've done research. We've also done discrete choice experiments. We've actually had a couple of sleep specialists look at the twice-nightly sodium oxybate data from the FDA and from safety reports before, that really shows no difference in cardiovascular outcomes for patients on mixed salts or on the sodium oxybates. But also we've done discrete choice experiments where physicians and patients could choose between different product attributes and the dosing of LUMRYZ definitely comes out above the sodium content with both audiences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very good. And like you said, you've treated 400 patients as of Q3 and so at September end, are you seeing an equal split within the switch group from the first gen oxybates? Are you seeing an equal switch from Xyrem and Xywav or is there a different proportion?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we've stated that the majority of patients thus far are patients switching from the first generation oxybates, with slightly more coming actually from the mixed salt or from Xywav.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And again, you've mentioned there's three subsegments, obviously, there's the first gen oxybates where they're switching from and then former oxybate users and then naive users. For the -- what about these second and third buckets? What are your sales reps basically pitching to doctors why LUMRYZ should be the preferred agent?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Well, our sales representatives go in there and talk about clinical data and unmet need and when we really think about a couple of things. So first, those patients, those three buckets are predominantly within all the oxybate prescribers offices. So it's not like we have to go to speak to different audiences here. And the value proposition is equally strong in all three segments. We know from previously discontinued patients from first generation oxybates, the two see the reasons why they most often discontinued are the product didn't work or they couldn't take it and those are very interrelated for those who struggled. Clearly, LUMRYZ is a great opportunity and it's interesting, Andrew, I just spoke with a physician last week who said, it's just so much easier to have the conversation about using oxybate with LUMRYZ now compared to first generations. I don't have to explain why I'm forcing you wake up during the middle of the night.</p><p>So we have a strong proposition and part of it is also a bit of a math equation for the fact that there's more of these switch patients that are in offices right now. But it's been great to sort of see we have representation from all three segments, both from rise up and also for patients who have initiated therapy as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>I see. Thanks. And like you said, majority of patients so far are switchers qualitatively for the naive group for instance, what is the hurdle here, is it step edits or like you just said, is it the sheer volume of first gen oxybate users that you're seeing a relatively less adoption in the second and third bucket?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think you're right, some of it is the math equation. 16,000 persistent patients on oxybates around 3,000 annual new starts. So almost like a four to five to one ratio if you think about those. But I think the other thing is, we're actually doing pretty good in naives as well. We actually have a good representation and we know from our market research consistently and just anecdotally from the HTPs thus far, why LUMRYZ is, as I just mentioned before, potentially a different value proposition for naive patients as well. So we actually sort of see right out of the gate strong performance in all three patient segments thus far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>And is there, would you say, you know, low hanging fruit, like if someone were to ask you what's a low hanging fruit for the next six to 12 months, would it still be within the first gen oxybate users or not necessarily in your view?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>I think just where we are in the math, once again, would sort of support that. But I think as time goes on, sort of quarter-over-quarter, we definitely sort of see the other, definitely the naive patients sort of being better represented going forward as well. But no, today we really want to meet with HCPs where they are and the types of patients that they see coming in the next few visits as well. So we sort of customize our conversation to where they sort of see their patient's journey as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And again, 1,000 patients signed up, 400 treated as of September end. So if we were to ask you, how do these numbers look today if you were to take another data cut, how would they look? Any kind of qualitative commentary? I know you refrain from sharing quantitative, but qualitatively are -- is it -- are things looking in a right direction to, you know, meeting or surpassing your internal expectations? Any color would be great?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think as we've entered Q4 and have gotten into it a little bit now, I think what we've seen, you know, as we've exited through Q3, we continue to see that. We have clearly put more patients in to rise up and more patients have gone on therapy. So from that standpoint, I think we continue to see the demand. We've always characterized it as a few key learnings during the first few months of launch, is one, we haven't met a clinician who hasn't told us that there's not a place for LUMRYZ in their practice, that it's an important treatment option.</p><p>It really becomes a question of how many and how fast do they adopt. And every physician is on their own continuum from that perspective. But what we do see is physicians seeing patients in the ordinary course, right? So as they come in, whether it's twice a year, three times a year or whatever it may be to see their physician, that's the cadence at which we see potential patients coming through who could potentially be candidates for LUMRYZ. And that was the case in Q3 and we continue to see that continue through the early part of Q4 and more patients coming in at the top of the funnel, more going on drug.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>And speaking of patients at the top of the funnel, one, as of early August, if I remember correctly, 400 patients had signed up, September end, it was 1,000 cumulative patient. So the difference is 600 over the course of almost two months. So as we think about the next two months or the next two to three months, could that slope or that patient additions to the Rise Up program look the same or, you know, directionally speaking, is it slowing down? Any color?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>I think to build off what Greg said, it's sort of we keep adding, we sort of look for steady growth. You know, part of a couple of things. First, we're going to get into holiday season where there's just less clinic days for these patients. But the other thing that's really important for us, Andrew, especially for new prescribers is we want to set them up and have them have initial positive experiences so they get comfortable using our product and then it can potentially become repeat users as well. So we're looking for steady growth and that's what we'd anticipate going into Q4.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Great. And you've mentioned, you know, the breakeven point here is about 1,300 to 1,500 patients on an assumed $120,000 net price. So that's about, you know, $150 million yo $200 million run rate, I think. So, again, you have 1,000 patients signed up, so you're not that far away. So the question is, are a majority of these 1,000 bound to convert? And if so, is it fair to assume it won't take much for you to reach breakeven after that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, the metric has been really, really consistent. You know, we always say 1,300 to 1,500 reimbursed patients, you know, to get to a cash flow breakeven number. We like how we actually did in Q3, you know, with 400 patients on therapy, 600 in the pipeline and we expect the majority of those to convert and go on therapy as well. And then we have the continued growth, you know, through Q4. So, you know, so the metric remains consistent and I think we're on a good trajectory to cash flow breakeven.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Wonderful. And does that breakeven number consider you needing, not needing, but wanting to start life cycle management opportunities for LUMRYZ? You've said how you want to pursue IH pediatric narcolepsy, as well as low sodium version of LUMRYZ?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>It is just based on what LUMRYZ is indicated for today, which is for the treatment of Narcolepsy, so it doesn't take into consideration the life cycle management opportunities you described.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very clear. And as we go back to the launch, talk to us about what you -- how you're thinking about discontinuation rates. Directionally speaking, do you envision LUMRYZ to have a lower dropout rate compared to the first-gen Oxybates and why?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I mean, when we look historically at the first-generation Oxybates, from claims data, we see that about approximately 25% of patients discontinue after one month and about 50% after 12 months. So that's sort of the benchmark that we have. We believe what the LUMRYZ value proposition we should be able to do a bit better. But early on, we have very, very, very early data for dropouts at that one to two-month transition and we are seeing lower discontinuation rates. But if you sort of go underneath those numbers, there's also the fact that we are getting more patients switching from first-generation oxybates early on, so they're probably on a bit of a different dropout curve or the persistency curve than a naive patient. So, you know, it's early, so we'll learn more over time, but we're definitely pleased with what we see thus far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. And, you know, you have a open-label study that I believe should have wrapped up or is wrapping up that has 100 patients. So does that -- have they all converted so far? And remind us, patients who convert from the open-label study, do they get counted as Rise Up patients or do they directly get counted as a treated patient?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, great question. Yeah, so when we got approved, we were a little under 100 patients who were still in the open-label study. So the study did close as of October 31st. And why that's also important for us is there's a closeout questionnaire that talks about the patient experience that we intend to publish in the future as well. So we did convert the vast majority of those patients and they did use Rise Up because that's really the mechanism for all these patients, so they do count in the base that we have for enrollments thus far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very good. And speaking of gross to nets, again, steady state cadence, I believe if my math is correct around 30% gross to net at steady state to get you to $120,000. But initially, how should we, you know, Wall Street be thinking about gross to net for LUMRYZ?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, when we talk about $120,000 in net revenue per patient per year, it takes into account lot of dynamics, of course. We're not all the way through our contracting process with the payers, as an example. So as these variables start to, you know, start to reach more of a steady state, you know, $120,000 is our expectation net revenue per patient. We haven't comped specifically on the percentage. We would expect just to add some additional color for you, Andrew, that on average, you know, patients will probably reach an average strength of 7.5 grams. Our WAC today is about $177,000 of that strength.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very good. And speaking of payer access, you know, you've locked in a good amount of contracts already. So are there any additional PBM wins that you need to drive further growth or is it more of a nice to have going forward?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, no. We're super proud of the work that the market access team has done. We just announced that we have about 100 million commercially covered lives, 60% of the commercially covered lives under the universe with the policy now. So yeah, you know, if you think about it, so we have two of the three GPO contracts done. We have a lot of the PBM lives under the Accent or the Express Scripts family, with the CVS sort of deal, we still have some to pull through on the PBM there. And the third GPO is the MSR family with the Optum United Life. So we have not signed that yet. So that's clearly one of our next goals. And, you know, when assuming we get there as well, that would be a nice step forward for us to pull through more of those lives as well, but it's been really great progress thus far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And Q4, as we think about Q4 again, the consensus is around $16 million. How many patients do you think that number entails?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, this -- you give me the benefit of some swag, the side of the numbers here. But, you know, we exited, again, we exited Q3, 400 patients on therapy. So we carry all that into Q4. Listen, I think incrementally and I have to think about this in terms of averages, you know, probably on average during the course of Q4, an incremental 300 patients, give or take 10% is going to give me some leeway either side of that number.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very helpful. Okay. And when is the next time you do plan to share these KPIs, you know, to treat patient sign-ups? Do we need to wait until your next earnings call later in February, March? Or is there an earlier venue or appropriate -- more appropriate time for you to disclose?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we'll certainly provide our updates on our key launch metrics at least quarterly. And then as opportunities present themselves, decide if there's a place in time to provide more interim related data. We've been, we believe, very transparent with our launch to date. We gave two really material updates within the first two months of launch and then we just gave our first full quarter update. So we understand the importance of keeping our investors informed. And certainly, we'll be on the ordinary course cadence of quarterly and if there's an opportunity inter-quarter, we'll certainly evaluate that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And what is, I'm just curious, what is your guys' philosophy on providing guidance? At what time do you think you would start providing guidance to investors?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, I think about it the same way in terms of the importance of transparency. We understand that the Street is looking for some of that from us. For us, I think what's most important is to continue to execute on our fundamentals of our launch and some of the variable dynamics, whether it's payer coverage and conversion rates and patients on reimbursed drug, all of those things that are important factors, as those things continue to get more stable and less variable as we get more payer wins, as we get more prescribers on board, as offices get more comfortable with our process and there's some stabilizing going on -- on some of these key variables, then I think at some point we certainly will be, like all companies, doing guiding, we'll guide accordingly. But at this point, you know, we haven't given any time frame of when that will occur.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>And speaking of conversion rates from the sign-ups to treated patients, again, you've mentioned how these thousand patients majority should convert. But is that the right percentage we should be thinking of over time as you accumulate more patients? Where is that conversion rate going to trend at steady state mainly?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, it's, conversion rates are one of those things, especially early on launches, that are just, they're very dynamic, right? You know, so what we know is we had over 400 enrollments from Q2. We announced that we had over 400 patients initiate therapy in Q3 and of the around 600 who are left, our belief is that the majority of those will get on to LUMRYZ as well. So, you know, I think we're still evolving and not to be a cope, but some of the things are we have patients using our temporary assistance program right now, people who will switch from one bucket to another.</p><p>What we can sort of say is our systems work. We're very proud, the processes are working, people are getting more comfortable with them. We also anticipate, as we've just talked about before, payer coverage to improve here as well. So wherever we are right now, our goal is to continue to improve our success rates because ultimately, every percentage point is another patient or another group of patients who can potentially benefit from LUMRYZ and that's really our North Star as well. So we're proud of where we are, but we will always look for ways to continuously improve where we can.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And maybe asked another way, what do you guys think in the big picture are the bottlenecks to ensure that prevents you from having even more sales or patient signups? You know, if someone were to ask you that question, what would those bottlenecks be and how do you address those?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>You know, I'd say thus far, we wouldn't really say we've seen \"bottlenecks\". Someone on our team really uses a great analogy. During launches early on, you have a lot of campfires and you're trying to avoid any forest fires. So we haven't really seen anything what we could depict as a forest fire. But a lot of things that we have to continually adjust here. So I think for us right now, you know, our sales force has been out there in full force now for a couple months, getting out there more familiar with HCPs. Offices are getting more familiar with our fulfillment process. And we're getting more coverage. So all that together should lead to improvement across the board over time. So like I said, we're really proud of where we are right now and we're just going to look at ways that we can keep continuously improving, so that more patients have the chance to benefit from LUMRYZ.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Very helpful. Okay. Well, congrats so far on the launch, fingers crossed in terms of continued uptake. But moving on to lifecycle management opportunities, again, there's three things. So the first one is, you filed for pediatric indication. Talk to us how big of an opportunity this is, do the same proportion of, you know, switchers from first-gen Oxybates, those three buckets, are they the same proportion for pediatric population?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe the first comment I would make and Richard, feel free to weigh in, is that, after we talk to clinicians about LUMRYZ and Narcolepsy, the next two questions we get almost unanimously are, when are you going to get a pediatric indication? And when are you going to study it in idiopathic hypersomnia? So those are two of our three lifecycle management strategies. Andrew, as you noted, we filed our supplemental NDA last week. We would expect, assuming, you know, FDA acceptance, that the action date will be in early September of next year, a 10-month standard review.</p><p>When we look at the pediatric market, it currently comprises of 4% to 5% of the current Oxybate prescription market, that's how we estimate it today, based upon claims data. But I will say, as much as we hear from patients with narcolepsy and have heard from people with narcolepsy leading up to the approval of LUMRYZ for adults, we hear almost as much from parents of children with narcolepsy, who are the ones who are really waking up in the middle of the night to care for their child, to get them their medicine, to administer their medicine, so they can attempt to normalize their life as well. And there's a lot of interest from that standpoint. So I think, most importantly, it expands the patient population who could potentially benefit. It positively impacts caregivers and families and we think it's an important next step for us in terms of helping to serve this community.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks. And then comes idiopathic hypersomnia. When does that trial start? And do you go straight to a Phase 3 study? And what are the timelines then to approval?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah, we haven't guided specifically on timelines, but I'll tell you where we are today. Yes, we will go straight to a Phase 3. We're in the planning stages of that, which incorporates a lot of different components from clinical supply to IND approvals to CRO selections to placebo manufacturing to site selection, site activation. All of that work is initiated and a lot of work being done to get ourselves in a position in the future to initiate this trial, which as we sit here today, I would estimate that patient initiation and site activation into the trial will likely be a second half of 2024 event and then it becomes a question of how long to enroll. And as we get into the trial, we'll talk more about that in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Makes sense, makes sense. And then you also have, you're working on a low-sodium version of LUMRYZ. So is there an accelerated pathway there as well?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Kim:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the first step in that is really formulation, preclinical work that is going on currently and continuing to advance and progress. Our objective with this program is to attempt to develop and formulate and develop a once-nightly low or no sodium product that is bioequivalent to LUMRYZ that if the FDA agrees would give us a potential pathway to file a supplement and really file on a PK-only basis. That's subject to final formulation work and what that looks like in FDA agreement. But from a pathway standpoint, that's what we're trying to pursue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Maybe last couple of questions is about the litigation front. So again, Jazz is, you know, there's you and the FDA versus Jazz. So what are the next steps in terms of that court case?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, I mean, the simple straightforward answer is there's a trial that starts on February 26th. It's going to be a one-week, we expect it to be a one-week trial. It probably won't take the jury too long to deliberate and come to a decision after that. So I'd say in a best-case scenario, Andrew, you know, we know what the outcome is from that patent litigation by the end of Q1. It may spill over into Q2, but this has been going on for, you know, for several years now.</p><p>So we're looking forward to putting the rearview mirror.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Wow. And is that, sorry, there are other cases going on. So is this the one related to orphan drug exclusivity or is it a different one?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>No. So there's patent litigation. This is related to Jazz suing us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Got it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas McHugh:</emphasis></p><p>The other case that you mentioned is where Jazz sued FDA. You know, we joined in that case with FDA. The hearing date has not been set for that at this point, but all parties have agreed that a hearing could be set effectively any time after mid-January. So we have an expectation it could be heard in Q1. Again, hopefully, you know, resolved and decision made, if not in Q1, certainly in the first half of next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. I think that's all the time we had, but nonetheless, I think point things are all pointing in the right direction, and, you know, thanks for sharing all the color today and thanks everyone for listening in.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gregory Divis:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Tsai:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, everybody.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-5c599966b21456d2b13660a6797ec761</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTK-K4F3-RS7P-V4HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 14, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0001W4J</classCode><className>AVADEL PHARMACEUTICALS PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FOOD &amp;

I must say I was not totally surprised when I heard that news. Back in high school, when she was an all-area pitcher for Barrington's softball team, Voris also found time to unwind by riding bareback on neighborhood trails aboard her quarter horse named Babe. \"My mom (Tamara) and dad (Jim) always made it a priority of having a really deep appreciation for the outdoors,\" said the 31-year-old Voris, one of the finest pitchers to step on the Fields of Dreams' pitching mound. </p><p>\"And also for the wildlife, the animals and pets in our lives.\" Today, Voris is an Events and Outreach Associate at the Great Peninsula Conservancy in Bremerton, Wash. The nonprofit organization was formed in 2000 to conserve vibrant forests, streams, shorelines and community green spaces to help wildlife and people thrive. \"It's all for a good cause,\" Voris said. \"The big push out this way is to protect habitats for salmon. It is a heavily populated area of orcas and they really depend on salmon as their primary food. \"We're protecting habitat and teaching kids the importance about getting outdoors and all kinds of good stuff like that.\" Voris had some pretty good \u2018stuff' when she became the only Mid-Suburban League pitcher to throw in the Elite Eight three years in a row. Her 36 wins in 2007 tied her for second in IHSA history for the most wins in a single season. She went on to produce a 71-26 career record at Washington University in St. Louis and a .343 batting average. At Washington, she earned her bachelor's degree in anthropology, Spanish and women and gender and sexuality studies. After graduating from Washington, Voris worked as a family case manager in Chicago from 2011 to 2013. \"It was my first job out of college and I found out I needed a break from it,\" she said. \"I wanted to get outside and see the country. \"Sometimes the best way to see the country is on foot because it really makes you appreciate all the changes as you go along.\" So Voris spent the next five months climbing the Appalachian Mountains. \"We covered 20,187 miles,\" she said. \"We went the length of the east coast from Maine to Georgia. We brought tents and did a lot of camping for about a half year.\" Voris wound up in Washington last November. \"My partner John and I moved here a year ago,\" Voris said. \"He is doing his medical residency in Washington and plans to have a family practice.\" Meanwhile, Voris is enjoying her time with the Great Peninsula Conservancy. \"I do the events and outreach program,\" she said. \"I organize the outdoor camp, which is a program for underserved youth. We get out for the summers, going to archaeology dig sites, doing trail maintenance and a lot of service learning. It's a lot of environmental sort of subjects. \"I'm in the process now of rethinking what our summer is looking like because everyone is homebound (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) but hopefully we can get back to the camps.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Welsh/,<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:welsh@dailyherald.com\">welsh@dailyherald.com</email> Claire Voris, a 2007 Barrington graduate, now works for the Great Peninsula Conservancy in Washington state.Photo courtesy of Claire Voris Barrington graduate Claire Voris, one of the best softball pitchers in school history, is pictured here in the John Marshall Wilderness in Washington state, an area burned out from a forest fire.

JOHN'S, Canada</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Commission issued the following joint statement by the leaders of Canada and the European Union on the European Union-Canada Summit 2023:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I. Building a more prosperous, secure, and sustainable future</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. We, the leaders of Canada and the European Union (EU), met today in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador to reaffirm our strategic partnership, advance our cooperation to seize the opportunities of our time and respond to pressing challenges. In a more complex, competitive and unpredictable world, working together to promote our shared values of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the rules based international order and to pursue our common interests is more important than ever. We stand firmly together in the pursuit of peace, stability and prosperity in the world including in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p><p>2. Our steadily deepening partnership makes us stronger and more resilient, delivering clear benefits to our people by generating sustainable economic growth and creating jobs. Cooperation between Canada and the EU can help make life more affordable and create good jobs - on both sides of the Atlantic. Our common values and principles are why we are positioned to grow circular, nature positive and climate-neutral economies across Canada and Europe that are competitive, inclusive and provide equal opportunities for all, and why we are able to work together to fight the triple crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to protect people from its worst impacts. We are putting people first as we do this - making sure households are better off as we build a prosperous climate neutral economy.</p><p>3. We emphasize the fundamental role that the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) and the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) have played in strengthening our relationship in the seven years since they were signed, remain strongly committed to ensuring their full and effective implementation and their ratification, and commit to further expanding our cooperation under these agreements.</p><p>4. Today we are pleased to announce significant new areas of cooperation. The establishment of a Green Alliance will deepen our already close cooperation on climate action and shared work to grow sustainable, competitive economies with good jobs. A Digital Partnership will strengthen our engagement on digital transformation and governance in a rapidly changing world. Substantive negotiations of an agreement on Canada's participation in the EU's Horizon Europe programme are now completed and both sides are working towards its prompt signature and implementation. The agreement will further strengthen the cooperation of our science communities in addressing global challenges.</p><p>II. Global Priorities</p><p>5. Our support to Ukraine is steadfast. We share an unequivocal condemnation of Russia's ongoing war of aggression and our unwavering commitment to Ukraine including a just and sustainable peace based on international law, Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. We will continue our intensified diplomatic outreach efforts and cooperation with Ukraine and other countries to ensure the widest possible international support for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace and the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula, with a view to a Global Peace Summit being held. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, will work to address Ukraine's immediate military and defence needs and ensure Ukraine has the long-term security commitments needed, while it pursues its Euro-Atlantic integration. We will do so in full respect of the security and defence policy of certain EU Member States and taking into account the security and defence interests of all EU Member States, the EU and Canada. We will work together to support Ukraine's sustainable security, will continue providing military, humanitarian, economic and financial support, and facilitate trade, private investment, and will prioritize recovery and reconstruction. We welcome the informal coordination between Canada and the EU's training missions, Operations UNIFIER and EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM), conducting critical training of the Ukrainian military. Canada and the EU alongside other G7 Members, will continue to work through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform on ensuring a robust response to Ukraine's reconstruction needs. To further strengthen this collaboration, Canada intends to deploy a secondee to the Platform's Secretariat in the near future. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and substantial efforts to meet the required conditions in its EU accession process. We encourage Ukraine to continue on its path of reforms. We will continue to work together to support Ukraine's security, defence and resilience on one hand, and reconstruction and reforms on the other, thus creating conditions to mobilise private investment. The EU and Canada will continue cooperating to deliver concrete solutions in support of Ukraine's agriculture and agri-food sector which could include facilitating exports of grain and agricultural products from Ukraine to third countries including those most in need. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path.</p><p>6. Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. The EU and Canada call for work to continue, including in the Core Group, on efforts to establish a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine that would enjoy the broadest cross-regional support and legitimacy, and towards the establishment of a future compensation mechanism. Canada and the EU recognise that decisive progress is needed, in coordination with partners, on how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilised assets could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction, consistent with applicable contractual obligations, and in accordance with EU and international law.</p><p>7. We recognize the value and the growing importance of our cooperation on restrictive measures. In particular, we will continue to impose extensive sanctions targeting Russia, as well as stringent export control restrictions and prohibitions. Moreover, we are committed to further strengthening our cooperation and coordination on broader sanctions actions, including disrupting circumvention, in support of our policy objectives.</p><p>8. We unequivocally condemn Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel on October 7. We support Israel's right to defend itself, in accordance with international law and international humanitarian law. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and welcome the recent agreement to liberate hostages and to allow for an extended humanitarian pause to permit the delivery of essential supplies. We underscore that Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations.</p><p>9. We are gravely concerned about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and welcome the adoption of resolution 2712 by the United Nations (UN) Security Council, which calls for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip. We reaffirm the imperative to protect civilians and ensure full compliance with international law, including international humanitarian law. We strongly reiterate the importance of urgent and unimpeded access for life saving humanitarian aid flowing to Gaza through all necessary measures, including humanitarian corridors and pauses. We have contributed significant funding for humanitarian assistance and remain committed to addressing urgent humanitarian needs.</p><p>10. We remain committed to the goal of comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East, and re-iterate our belief in the renewed importance of progress towards a two-state solution on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions through reinvigorated efforts in the peace process. We stand ready to contribute to reviving a political process on the basis of the two-state solution, with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous, sovereign, and viable Palestinian State, living side-by-side in peace and security and mutual recognition. We remain opposed to any forced displacement of Palestinians. We condemn all forms of intolerance and discrimination, on the basis of religion, belief or origin and remain firmly committed to combatting all forms of hatred.</p><p>11. We express deep concerns with Iran's nuclear escalation and its refusal to meaningfully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and its persistent failure to implement JCPOA commitments. We wholly support the IAEA's mission of continued verification and monitoring in Iran. A diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear issue remains the best way to address international concerns. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon.</p><p>12. We are prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, including through cooperation on global issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, debt sustainability, global health and pandemic preparedness. China is an important trade and economic partner and we will seek to ensure a level playing field and a balanced, reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship. We will continue to reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in its supply chains, and will de-risk and diversify where necessary and appropriate. We do not intend to decouple or to turn inwards. The East and South China Seas are of strategic importance for regional and global prosperity and security. We remain seriously concerned about growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in Canada's or the EU's One China policy. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang. With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.</p><p>13. We recognize the critical challenges faced by our countries and by our global partners, from climate impacts and food insecurity to ensuring a just transition, good governance, rule of law, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will work together with partners from around the world to address these challenges, including in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. In the Pacific Islands, we will reinforce our support, including to advance their priorities in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms. We agree on the importance of a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic.</p><p>14. We reaffirm our commitment to coordinate our actions in the Sahel region, alongside international and regional organizations. We support L'Academie Internationale de Lutte Contre le Terrorisme in Cote d'Ivoire in responding to evolving terrorist threats and violent extremism. We will work together in supporting the people of Haiti in their efforts to build a more resilient and equitable future, including by fighting impunity and corruption, restoring security and stability and creating the necessary conditions for holding democratic elections.</p><p>III. Sustainable economic growth for all</p><p>15. The Canada-EU economic relationship, underpinned by CETA, has contributed to delivering prosperity for our economies during a period of global uncertainty. Now in the seventh year of provisional application, CETA's benefits to workers, exporters and our economies are clear: in 2022, bilateral trade in goods was significantly higher to pre-CETA levels in 2016. Through a single set of high standard rules, businesses and workers in Canada and the EU are benefitting from a more predictable, transparent and accessible business environment. Canada and the EU will continue to use the mechanisms established by CETA to cooperate towards building resilient and diversified supply chains. We will continue work to ensure the full implementation of CETA, and to sustainably strengthen Canada-EU trade, including for small and medium-sized enterprises and women entrepreneurs. Canada and the EU acknowledge the important role CETA can play in driving sustainable development and moving towards a climate neutral economy. We welcome related investments and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.</p><p>16. Canada and the EU intend to focus on the negotiations toward a renewed competition cooperation agreement that would drive deeper cooperation and coordination possibilities between our respective competition agencies, providing a legal framework to coordinate enforcement activities and share information obtained through investigative powers in full respect of data privacy guarantees.</p><p>17. Canada is well-positioned to contribute to Europe's energy security and energy transition. The Canada-EU High Level Energy Dialogue will continue facilitating action on all energy-related matters, including proceeding with the EU becoming a member of the Equal by 30 Campaign, led by Canada, which is working towards equal pay, equal leadership and equal opportunities for women in the energy sector by 2030 and launching a new European Commission - Canada Roadmap on Methane Emissions. We are laying the foundation for reliable hydrogen supply chains and common approaches to standards and certification, which will accelerate commercialization and increase transatlantic trade.</p><p>18. To secure reliable and sustainable supply chains and competitive economic growth, Canada and the EU continue to advance shared work on critical minerals, including through the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials. Critical minerals are essential for the transition towards climate-neutrality of our economies, and we will continue to support integrated, secure and diversified supply chain development, science, technology and innovation cooperation, and enhance global environmental, social and governance criteria and standards. This will include joint efforts to engage and connect our respective businesses to accelerate two-way trade and investment that can help develop new supply sources for critical minerals. Canada and the EU agree that secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials enabling the green and digital transition is emerging as a shared challenge for the global community and will continue discussing how participation in the EU-proposed Critical Raw Materials Club would complement and strengthen ongoing initiatives to jointly address that challenge.</p><p>19. Economic security is a growing concern for governments around the world, and cooperation with partners and engagement with stakeholders will assist with better policy-making. To support this, Canada and the EU will launch a Canada-EU dialogue on economic security to exchange information on trends and risks of mutual concern which could affect our economic security and developments with regards to possible policy responses.</p><p>IV. Combatting climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution</p><p>20. With today's establishment of a Canada-EU Green Alliance, Canada and the EU continue to deepen our partnership on fighting climate change, protecting the environment and ocean, halting and reversing biodiversity loss and growing a strong, prosperous future. Recognising the key role of both Canada and the EU in leading global efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and to foster a circular nature-positive and global climate neutral economy by 2050, the Alliance is a testament to the depth and breadth of our shared ambition. Building on our extensive existing cooperation, the Alliance aims to take our partnership to the next level by further intensifying our political, technical, economic and scientific cooperation on climate action, environmental and ocean protection, energy transition, green industrial transformation, regulatory and business cooperation, research and innovation, climate finance, sustainable finance and biodiversity finance and cooperation at the multilateral level and supporting the climate-neutral transitions of third countries.</p><p>21. Recent natural disasters and extreme weather events have devastated communities in Canada and Europe alike. Canada is grateful for the support provided through the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism during the most significant forest fire season on record in Canada. We welcome the signature of an administrative arrangement to improve the sharing of information and best practices on how to respond to emergencies. Canada is pleased to facilitate the export of Canadian-built fire-fighting aircraft to bolster the EU's and Member States' fleets.</p><p>22. We recognize that even more ambitious action is required to mitigate and build resilience to climate change, underpinned by an unwavering commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and ensuring a credible path to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the upcoming 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we will work together to promote decisive global action to tackle the climate crisis and to set the direction for future global climate efforts on the basis of the Global Stock Take recommendations. We will work together to accelerate the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels no later than 2050 and end the construction of new coal-fired power generation in a manner consistent with the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Recognizing the importance of increasing energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy, we will work towards the full and effective implementation of the Global Energy Pledge to collectively double the rate of energy efficiency improvements every year to 2030 and to triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030 to 11 Terawatts, while respecting each country's national energy mix. We will also work to support the most vulnerable countries, including by delivering on climate finance commitments, calling on contributors to raise their ambition, and establishing funding arrangements on loss and damage. We will continue to convene the Ministerial on Climate Action with China, and will continue to lead global action on short-lived climate pollutants, including methane, under the Global Methane Pledge, the Global Methane Initiative, the International Methane Emissions Observatory and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.</p><p>23. We will lead the way to mobilise partners around the world for the signature, ratification and effective implementation of the High Seas Treaty and for the swift and full implementation of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF), agreed to in Montreal. To this end, we will work together to develop ambitious nature-positive policies, mainstreaming biodiversity into all sectors. We share the objective to prevent global deforestation, and we intend to work together and with others to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030, including as they relate to global supply chains, while delivering sustainable development and promoting an inclusive rural transformation. We will also cooperate towards substantially and progressively increasing the mobilisation of financial resources to support international biodiversity objectives, in line with the goals and the targets of the KMGBF.</p><p>24.We recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to spur related investment and innovation in the interest of the people's health and well-being. In that regard, Canada and the EU reaffirm their support for the Call to Action for Paris Aligned Carbon Markets, launched at the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact. Canada welcomes the EU as the most recent Partner to join the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge to expand the use of carbon pricing globally by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. Canada and the EU commit to continue exchanges on their carbon pricing systems and working closely on measures to address carbon leakage risks in a non-discriminatory manner including on next steps for cooperation on the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). We will also address emissions intensity of the steel and aluminium manufacturing industries and advance manufacturing, re-manufacturing and recycling of steel and aluminium, both at home and abroad, and will continue cooperating closely in bilateral and multilateral fora.</p><p>25. We are committed to ending plastic pollution by 2040 and will work together, including through the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, to develop a dedicated ambitious and effective international legally binding instrument.</p><p>26. Through the Canada-EU Ocean Partnership, we are increasing cooperation on ocean governance, conservation, science, and sustainable use. In this context, we welcome the first Ocean Partnership Forum that took place in October 2022, and look forward to the next Forum planned for 2025. We will work together to achieve an ambitious Our Ocean Conference in Greece in 2024 and UN Ocean Conference in Nice in 2025.</p><p>V. Research and innovation cooperation and responsible digital innovation</p><p>27. We reaffirm our support for collaborative partnerships between our science research communities. Today, we are pleased to announce the completion of substantive negotiations on Canada's association to Pillar II of Horizon Europe, which once signed and implemented will provide new opportunities for international science partnerships on global challenges.</p><p>28. As strategic partners in emerging technologies and cutting-edge research, we will contribute solutions to global challenges and provide new economic opportunities. We are launching the Canada-EU Digital Partnership, which will allow us to deepen our engagement on areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), online platform governance and accountability, and quantum technologies, secure international connectivity and cyber security, digital skills and digital credentials and digital identities.</p><p>29. Canada and the EU share an interest in fostering safer, more inclusive digital environments. To this end, the Canada-EU Digital Partnership will be an important forum to collaborate on efforts to advance the accountability of online platforms such as social media and online marketplaces - in a way that enhances the respect for all human rights online. We are committed to holding online platforms accountable to mitigate the negative effects of content on their services on systemic societal risks, including gender-based violence, notably by giving their users tools and resources to protect themselves, and by mandating significantly more transparency for our societies over online content moderation.</p><p>30.Canada and the EU have a longstanding collaboration in advancing responsible design, development and use of AI, including through key multilateral forums like the G7, through the Hiroshima AI Process, and the Global Partnership on AI, where both are founding members. Canada and the EU are also among the most advanced jurisdictions in the world regarding the regulation of AI technologies. We are committed to working together on the global governance of digital and other emerging technologies, like AI, rooted in a risk-based approach, the protection of safety and respect for human rights and the rules-based international order, supported by appropriate accountability mechanisms. In support of this, we will collaborate to ensure applicable regulatory measures. As we continue our respective work on AI governance and regulatory frameworks, we commit to work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to share information and strive for solutions to facilitate the interoperability of our domestic approaches, helping to ensure AI actors in Canada and Europe have the greatest possible access to international markets to advance the safe, secure and trustworthy commercialization of this technology.</p><p>31. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. To this end, we will cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards levels to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyber incidents. We will also strengthen collaboration in upholding international norms of responsible state behaviour in cyber space, notably through the UN with the establishment of a Program of Action for cybersecurity and joint diplomatic responses to counter malicious behaviour. We will also seek opportunities to enhance cooperation and coordination on cyber capacity building efforts and exchange information on regulatory measures.</p><p>32. Further to the G7 Action Plan for Building a Secure and Resilient Digital Infrastructure, Canada and the EU intend to support secure international connectivity and explore possible new routes of international communication infrastructure to strengthen network resilience.</p><p>33. We recognize the transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing economic growth and sustainability, and the need to ensure that they respect human rights and democracy. We aim to ensure Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) in compliance with relevant rules in the respective jurisdictions, including data protection rules. We also welcome the EU - Canada close cooperation on the EU's adequacy decision to ensure its continuity.</p><p>VI. Advancing international peace and security</p><p>34. We welcome increased Canada-EU cooperation on security and defence, including the upcoming administrative arrangement which confirms Canada's participation in the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation Project on network of logistics hubs. We will seek to further deepen our cooperation through enhancing our security and defence dialogue, identifying opportunities for joint naval activities and strengthened collaboration on cyber security and the climate-security nexus. We reaffirm the importance of further strengthening and deepening the mutually reinforcing and beneficial EU-NATO partnership, while fully respecting the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity, transparency and decision-making autonomy. We will advance the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and meaningful participation of women and youth in prevention, mediation and resolution, in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.</p><p>35. In support of our joint efforts in combatting terrorism and serious transnational crime, we welcome the finalisation of the negotiations that pave the way for the conclusion of a new Canada-EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data Agreement. This Agreement will provide a solid basis for the transfer and use of PNR data and ensure the capacity to effectively and efficiently prevent and fight terrorism and serious transnational crime while upholding privacy protections and protecting human rights.</p><p>VII. Promoting Shared Values and the Rules-Based International Order</p><p>36. Democracy, human rights, gender equality and the rule of law remain universal principles that guide international action for both Canada and the EU. We are concerned with the ongoing backlash against gender equality and the rights of women, girls and LGBTI persons, including increased incidents of gender-based violence, including gender-based violence that is amplified by the use of technology. We will continue to call for respect for the rights of all women and girls, not only in Afghanistan and Iran, but around the world. We reaffirm our commitment to take concerted and collective action against arbitrary detention and to work closely to anchor its principles in the international legal and normative framework as well as to promote the biennial UN General Assembly Resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty. In 2023, Canadian observers have participated in EU election observation missions in Guatemala, Liberia, Maldives, Paraguay, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, and Canada will continue to work alongside the EU in electoral observation and the support of democratic principles and values.</p><p>37. We will continue to strengthen our collaboration to counter foreign threats to democracy, including through platforms like the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism. We will continue to work together to protect information integrity - grounded in inclusion, human rights and the rule of law - with the objective of defending against and increasing citizen and societal resilience to information manipulation and disinformation both online and offline, including through working on the development of international norms and principles, such as those in the Global Declaration on Information Integrity Online. We call on all foreign actors to cease and to refrain from interference activities, aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and processes and our economic prosperity. We will continue to work together on digital justice, and, in this context, welcome the first EU-Canada informal senior-level dialogue on justice issues, held in May 2022.</p><p>38. The EU and Canada will make resolute efforts to uphold the rules-based international order with the UN at its core. We will strive for a well-functioning, reformed multilateral system, with an effective and sustainably funded UN. We will endeavour to work towards an effective, inclusive and networked multilateral system that is capable of facing new global realities and remain true to the rules and principles of the UN Charter. We are committed to working together with all partners to reinforce and reform global governance in line with 'Our Common Agenda'. We are determined to seize the opportunities represented by the 2024 Summit of the Future and the 2025 World Social Summit to develop a system that is resilient and as relevant today as when it was created.</p><p>39. We are committed to cooperate to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to tackle modern day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024, including with respect to having a fully and well functioning dispute settlement system.</p><p>40. Canada and the EU agree to explore the possibility of establishing a new dialogue on humanitarian issues under the SPA. We will work to address priorities of the global community, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - both at home and abroad, including mobilising finances to close the SDG financing gap. In particular, we will also focus on delivering better, bigger and more effective Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact. We will also sustain our support to the necessary reforms to the multilateral system and its development banks, and financing for global public goods such as climate, biodiversity or pandemic prevention, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and shared prosperity, in line with the SDGs. We will also seek to prevent fragmentation through the transformation of the governance of the international financial architecture to make it more effective, transparent and accountable. We will contribute to strengthening global health security to better prevent, prepare and respond to current and future health emergencies, including by jointly promoting shared priorities for the successful conclusion of the negotiation of an effective, ambitious and legally binding new pandemic agreement, and the targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations, by May 2024. We also support the Pandemic Fund. We welcome plans for the first Canada-EU Health Policy Dialogue under the SPA, scheduled for early 2024. Global hunger has been rising since 2015 and has been intensified by rising food and energy insecurity. We stand ready to continue contributing to the global fertilizers production and value chains in order to ensure food security, decreasing dependency on Russian and Belarusian production.</p><p>41. We have also agreed to deepen our partnership in support of high-quality global infrastructure development, in line with the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment and EU Global Gateway initiative's common objectives.</p><p>42. We recognize the importance of sustainable, resilient and quality infrastructure throughout the world. We are committed to working together towards the joint G7 aim of mobilizing $600 billion in financing through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the EU Global Gateway initiative. Under these initiatives, we welcome our collaboration in support of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships with South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal, including under the Great Green Wall initiative. We will continue our close cooperation on the Kiwa Initiative, a multi-donor program that aims to strengthen climate change resilience in the Pacific Islands through nature-based solutions. FinDev Canada will continue to partner with EU-based development finance institutions to advance sustainable infrastructure solutions in support of positive development, climate and nature outcomes.</p><p>VIII. Conclusion</p><p>43. Canada and the EU are committed to addressing today's global challenges, including economic uncertainty, climate change, biodiversity loss, digital transformation, natural disasters and regional instabilities. Canada and the EU will be guided by our common commitment to democratic values, the rule of law, human rights, sustainability and an inclusive, multilateral, and rules-based international system. We will continue to work together in safeguarding our shared values, addressing common challenges, embracing the new opportunities of a rapidly changing world and strengthening the dynamic EU-Canada people-to-people contacts.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_6054\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_23_6054</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8383379 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8383379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RM-DGK1-JC11-10MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5909\"/><timeReceived>12:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 24, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The winters in Chicago are tougher than many, with Lake Michigan helping to push freezing cold winds through narrow Chicago streets and alleyways.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite challenging weather, Chicago winters get a bad name. As cold weather brings in snow and winds, winter-specific natural blessings reveal themselves. Walking along the lakeside during a snowstorm, or even just sitting out in a field or park, simplifies life and mind to just think about warmth, and the white beauty that surrounds them.\u00a0</p><p>Do not underestimate the beauty of Lake Michigan during mid-winter. If the lake freezes, one can gaze out at what looks to be an arctic-like tundra. While the lake is not frozen, large ice blocks float seamlessly through the cold water.\u00a0</p><p>On some beaches in Chicagoland, such as Rosewood Beach in Highland Park, about 40 minutes north of Lincoln Park, the freezing winter winds propel the icy waves over flood barriers and freeze water mid-air. The aftermath of these waves can create vast forests of icicles on nearby trees, and most shockingly, small ice caves.\u00a0</p><p>Snow creates a certain calm, serenity. As the skies and grounds white out, stimuli lessen. Instead of dense, humid heat on a walk to work, the type of heat that tends to make one mad, Chicagoans can learn to, or continue to, enjoy this calmness.\u00a0</p><p>\"I will just lie down in the snow, all bundled up, and look at the sky,\" Mia Cutler said, a resident of Chicago's northern suburbs for over 25 years. \"I love walking outside in the winter and taking my dog to the dog park. I tend to spend more time outdoors in the winter, than the summer.\"\u00a0</p><p>Michael Breen, who has lived in Bucktown for eight years, agrees with the calm the winter winds bring to Chicago.</p><p>\"The city feels safer at that time,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>On top of a seasonal serenity, winters in Chicago bring new activities. Sledding at Soldier Field's 35 foot sledding hill, ice skating through Maggie Daley Park's amazing skating ribbon and making snowmen bring out the child in all.\u00a0</p><p>During Christmas, Chicago opens its famous Christkindlmarket in Daley Plaza, which combines holiday trinket shopping with traditional German cuisine. If one can brave the long lines that are characteristic of this Chicago staple, it is a winter must.\u00a0</p><p>While many consider Chicago's winters to be arctic-like, average temperatures often do not reflect this.</p><p>According to weather.gov, the average temperature during Chicago's 2021-2022 winter (December-February) was 28.7 degrees, with a cumulative snowfall of twenty-eight inches Since the beginning of their data collection on average Chicago winter temperatures, they report that the average winter temperature has been 26.4 degrees, with an average snowfall of 29.6 inches.</p><p>Along with higher temperatures than many imagine, Chicago's most challenging season does not compare with other areas of the United States, such as California and Florida. Both states are believed to have attractive weather, despite the natural disasters that occur.\u00a0</p><p>California\u00a0 has to contend with an extremely destructive and violent yearly forest fire season. During the 2021 fire season in California, almost 3 million acres were burned, destroying 3,560 structures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p><p>With the city of Chicago being just 145,300 acres, California's 2021 fires could completely burn Chicago 20 times over.\u00a0</p><p>Florida, another state many consider worthy of jealousy as it pertains to their weather, has their own extremely destructive weather phenomenon to deal with: hurricanes. In 2018, category five Hurricane Michael killed 43 Floridians and caused $18.4 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric's Tropical Cyclone Report.\u00a0</p><p>Despite Chicago's reputation as a city with \"bad weather,\" the extremes of Chicago winters do not come close to the weather challenges faced by other U.S. communities on a yearly basis.</p><p>All this is not to say that winter is an easy time for many Chicagoans.

The fire began Sunday afternoon on Mount Tammany, a steep, rugged area of New Jersey's Worthington State Forest and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border. Fire officials said about 80 acres have burned overall, but no injuries have been reported. A cause for the fire had not been determined, officials said. The blaze was about 95% contained by late this morning, but officials say it likely won't be fully extinguished until expected rain showers pass through the area today and tomorrow that will soak any remaining hot spots. Chris Franek, the state forest fire service's assistant division fire warden, has said fires on similar terrain usually burn upward. But he said Sunday's fire, which started below a trail at an elevation of about 1,400 feet, burned downhill because the trail area is rocky and doesn't have abundant vegetation. Fires are rare there at this time of year because the area usually has a layer of snow, he said. The fire broke out on a sunny February day that had unusually mild temperatures. The Appalachian Trail crosses through the recreation area but remains open. -- Associated Press</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH2-7M31-JBSK-R00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0003YHS</classCode><className>STE DES AUTOROUTES RHONE-ALPES SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS237310 HIGHWAY, STREET &amp; BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC1611 HIGHWAY &amp; STREET CONSTRUCTION, EXCEPT ELEVATED HIGHWAYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEAJ</classCode><className>HIKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000A3OI</classCode><className>APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS154</classCode><className>PENNSYLVANIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Martin Heinrich, D-New Mexico, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) welcomed the Senate Appropriations Committee's bipartisan passage of the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations bill, and the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. This legislation includes $40 million in investments for 25 local projects across New Mexico. Next, the bills will be considered by the full Senate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I'm proud to directly advocate for local projects that deliver for New Mexicans through our annual government funding legislation,\" said Heinrich. \"These three bipartisan bills will deliver substantial and strategic investments to improve New Mexico's water and wastewater infrastructure, scale our deployment of clean energy and decarbonization technologies, build more efficient and affordable homes, construct safer roads and transportation networks, and fight the fentanyl epidemic.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>Energy and Water Development Bill Highlights</p><p>Locally Led Watershed Conservation: Senator Heinrich successfully included increased funding for Cooperative Watershed Management through the Bureau of Reclamation's (BOR) WaterSMART Programs, as well as language directing BOR to take additional steps to make the program more accessible to rural, historically underserved, and Tribal communities. This program has supported New Mexican led watershed conservation efforts, including work by the Santa Fe Watershed Association, the Hatch and Mesilla Valley Cooperative Watershed Management Program, the Animas Watershed Partnership, the Rio Fernando de Taos Revitalization Collaborative, and the Isleta Reach Stewardship Association.</p><p>Coordinated Rio Grande Basin Management: Senator Heinrich successfully included language that emphasizes the need for coordinated water management between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Upper Rio Grande Basin and directs the Corps to identify future work that can be done to improve coordinated operations.</p><p>Tribal Partnership: Senator Heinrich successfully included increased funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Tribal Partnership Program. This program is the only Corps authority that specifically works with Tribes as partners, assisting Tribes with water resources projects that address economic, environmental, and cultural resource needs. The program has supported numerous critically important flood control projects on Tribal lands in New Mexico.</p><p>Waiver of Cost Share for Energy Grants to Tribes: Senator Heinrich successfully advocated to make it easier for Tribal communities to receive energy grants from the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. In the bill, the Department of Energy (DOE) is encouraged to waive its requirement that award recipients pay for up to half the costs of the awarded project from the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, which has a mission to maximize the development and deployment of energy solutions for the benefit of American Indians and Alaska Natives.</p><p>Electric Grid Reliability: Senator Heinrich successfully championed the allocation of up to $1.2 billion in funding to enhance the domestic manufacturing supply chain for electric grid components, which includes financial assistance, technical assistance, and workforce support in innovative technologies. This investment will increase the reliability, resilience, and security of our national electric grid. Senator Heinrich has led bicameral efforts to secure funding for electrical transformers and complementary grid security technologies in the FY24 Appropriations bills, including a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting $2.1 billion in Disaster Supplemental Funding through the Defense Production Act.</p><p>Technology and National Labs: Senator Heinrich helped to secure $8.43 billion, $330 million over FY23 funding, for the Office of Science that includes support for DOE National Laboratories and newly authorized programs under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which is intended to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors. Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory support nearly 30,000 employees in New Mexico.</p><p>Southwest Border Regional Commission: Senator Heinrich led efforts to secure $8 million in funding for the Southwest Border Regional Commission (SBRC), which will foster economic development in the southern border regions of New Mexico, Arizona, California, and Texas. The SBRC service area includes 93 counties on the Southwest border with an average Hispanic population of 48% and a total minority population of 66%. Of the approximately 35 million people the SBRC serves, nearly 5 million live in poverty. The SBRC will support the region's communities, farmers, and businesses to reduce disparities in energy reliability, income, infrastructure, education, and access to clean water and health care.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Congressionally Directed Spending</p><p>Senator Heinrich successfully included funding for the following 7 local projects in the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill:</p><p>* $6,750,000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct irrigation infrastructure that is part of acequia systems in New Mexico. Acequias are vital to the agricultural heritage and economy of New Mexico and help keep critically valuable groundwater and surface water resources in balance.</p><p>* $1,200,000 for New Mexico State University to develop a cybersecurity training and testing center to analyze the security of energy infrastructure and technologies.</p><p>* $644,000 for the University of New Mexico to develop and demonstrate novel cybersecurity controls and a workforce training program for community microgrid applications.</p><p>* $260,000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to plan for the removal of jetty jacks in the Albuquerque area of the Rio Grande.</p><p>* $200,000 for New Mexico State University to partner with Jemez Pueblo to study the processing of wood wastes from forest fire burn scar sites and lumber mills to produce biochar, which can be used as feedstock for district heating, soil additives for carbon sequestration, and adsorbents for water treatment.</p><p>* $128,000 for Mesalands Community College to develop and demonstrate a renewable heating technology to decarbonize high-temperature industrial foundry processes.</p><p>* $80,000 for the Jicarilla Apache Nation to study opportunities to support the Tribe's economic development, energy transition, and decarbonization goals.</p><p>Additionally, Senators Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan successfully included funding in the bill for the following 2 projects:</p><p>* $1,720,000 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to carry out water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection projects in communities around New Mexico, which may include projects related to wastewater treatment, water supply, environmental restoration, and surface water resource protection and development.</p><p>* $500,000 for the Kit Carson Electric Cooperative to transform the Chevron Mine Facility into a green hydrogen production site, providing reliable nighttime renewable energy for members and creating jobs for the Village of Questa.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Bill Highlights</p><p>Rental Assistance: Senator Heinrich successfully included increased funding for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (Housing Choice Vouchers) and Project-Based Rental Assistance. The Housing Choice Voucher Program helps over 12,000 families in New Mexico. Senator Heinrich also secured additional administrative funding for public housing authorities to ensure that voucher holders, and other individuals who qualify for HUD housing programs, receive the necessary help and assistance to find safe and affordable housing.</p><p>Tribal Housing: Senator Heinrich successfully included an increase of $61.6 million from FY23 for the Indian Housing Block Grant. The Indian Housing Block Grant program is the single largest source of Tribal housing assistance. The program funds affordable housing activities including new housing construction, rehabilitation, and housing services. Senator Heinrich also successfully ensured that funding was not cut from the Tribal HUD-VA Supportive Housing Program, which provides rental assistance and supportive services to Native American veterans who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness living on or near a reservation or other Tribal areas.</p><p>Housing Supportive Services: Senator Heinrich successfully included increased funding for the Resident Opportunities and Supportive Services (ROSS) Program and the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program. The ROSS program allows public housing authorities to hire a program coordinator who links residents with training opportunities, job placement organizations, and local employers, and the FSS program promotes increased earnings and savings among families receiving HUD-funded rental assistance. Program participants work with an FSS service coordinator to identify their financial and employment-related goals, including education or training, and can access a range of support services, such as childcare or credit repair, that can assist in achieving their goals.</p><p>Zero-Emission Buses: Senator Heinrich successfully secured $50 million in additional funding for the Low and No Emission (Low-No) Vehicle Grant Program, which supports transit agencies in purchasing or leasing low or no emission buses and other transit vehicles that use advanced technologies such as battery electric or fuel-cell power. The vehicles can provide a cleaner, more energy efficient transit service in communities across the country. Senator Heinrich is a longtime proponent of this program, introducing the Low or No Emission Bus Access Act in 2020 and securing it in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021.</p><p>Active Transportation Infrastructure: Senator Heinrich successfully included continued funding of $45 million for the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investments Program at the Federal Highway Administration, which awards grants for communities to invest in active transportation networks that include walking and biking routes that enable people to reach their destinations more safely.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Congressionally Directed Spending</p><p>Senator Heinrich successfully included funding for the following 12 local projects in the Senate Transportation and Housing Appropriations bill:</p><p>* $4,300,000 for the City of Truth or Consequences to replace aged and damaged waterlines, valves, and hydrants.</p><p>* $4,000,000 for Bernalillo County to reconstruct Atrisco Vista Boulevard on the West Side of Albuquerque, helping to expand job and housing options for residents.</p><p>* $3,000,000 for the City of Albuquerque to continue development of a Homeless Youth Center to provide a safe, transitional environment for homeless and unstably housed youth.</p><p>* $3,000,000 for the City of Las Cruces to design, construct, and furnish a response station to house both its Mobile Integrated Healthcare and Project LIGHT (Lessen the Incidence of Grief, Harm, and Trauma) programs.</p><p>* $2,500,000 for the City of Albuquerque to develop a police substation in southwest Albuquerque to improve public safety service delivery in the area.</p><p>* $2,000,000 for Navajo Preparatory School to develop a Community Wellness and Cultural Complex to support academics, extracurricular activities like sports, language, and culture for students, faculty, staff, and communities on the Navajo Nation.</p><p>* $1,800,000 for the Town of Taos to complete the buildout of 72 vacant lots in the Chamisa Verde Housing Project to provide below-market housing options to working families.</p><p>* $1,200,000 for the City of Farmington to create the first fully inclusive, accessible, and adaptive park in the Four Corners region.</p><p>* $1,100,000 for Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity to develop land into a mixed-income development focused on 25 to 30 affordable housing units for low-income families.</p><p>* $1,000,000 for the Pueblo of Jemez to complete removal of condemned and hazardous buildings to enable new and expanded community development projects and programs.</p><p>* $200,000 for the Southwest Regional Housing and Community Development Corporation to complete the construction of five homes for very low-income families located in a Department of Housing and Urban Development-Designated Colonia.</p><p>* $180,000 for the North Central Regional Transit District to purchase a bus for public transportation between Mora and Las Vegas.</p><p>Additionally, Senators Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan successfully included funding in the bill for the following four projects:</p><p>* $2,000,000 for the Santo Domingo Pueblo to plan, design, repair, and construct over 200 tribal houses within the traditional village.</p><p>* $1,600,000 for Union and Colfax Counties to plan for the improvement of U.S. Route 87/64 to increase economic development in the area following the route's designation as a future interstate highway an part of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor.</p><p>* $338,000 for the Town of Silver City to develop lots and infrastructure in the Vistas de Plata subdivision to ensure affordable housing availability in Silver City.</p><p>* $283,000 for the Family YMCA to enhance youth substance use prevention services and programming at the teen center in Espanola.</p><p>* * *</p><p>State and Foreign Operations Bill Highlights</p><p>Stopping the Flow of Fentanyl: Senator Heinrich successfully included $125 million to support efforts to stop global flows of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and their precursor materials through diplomatic engagement, law enforcement cooperation and capacity building, and governance capacity support. The bill also requires the Department of State to designate a Counter Fentanyl Coordinator to coordinate these initiatives, and it fully funds the implementation of the FENTANYL Results Act to build foreign law enforcement capacity to detect synthetic drugs like fentanyl.</p><p>Combatting the Climate Crisis: Senator Heinrich successfully advocated for additional funding for bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to support biodiversity, adaptation, sustainable landscapes, and clean energy programs, including $150 million for the Clean Technology Fund.</p><p>Humanitarian Assistance: Senator Heinrich successfully included $9.1 billion--a $691 million boost above fiscal year 2023--for humanitarian assistance programs to help meet the unprecedented forced displacement, food insecurity, and other emergency needs across the globe in order to save lives, stabilize communities, and improve global security.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-announces-committee-support-of-25-local-projects-totaling-nearly-40-million-to-invest-in-clean-energy-water-and-transportation-infrastructure-build-more-affordable-housing-in-new-mexico_fight-the-fentanyl-epidemic\">https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-announces-committee-support-of-25-local-projects-totaling-nearly-40-million-to-invest-in-clean-energy-water-and-transportation-infrastructure-build-more-affordable-housing-in-new-mexico_fight-the-fentanyl-epidemic</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8222858 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8222858</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68S9-9YK1-JC11-1098-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2496\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 23, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, learning about the problem and its impacts can often create feelings of hopelessness. To keep these feelings from overwhelming people and preventing action, it's essential that the issue be presented along with ways to prevent despair by offering ways to take action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified to Congress that global warming had arrived and identified the cause as the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is the process by which gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane are emitted faster than they are removed from the atmosphere, leading to heat that would normally radiate back into space being trapped. Scientists have identified human activity as the cause of the current increase in the greenhouse effect, particularly due to the use of fossil fuels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to this, the average global temperature of the Earth has increased around 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit each decade since 1880. This process is increasing in speed, with an average increase of 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit from pre-industrial levels each decade since 1981. As the World Meteorological Organization noted in January, this has led to data showing that the last eight years, 2015-2022 specifically, have been the warmest years on record globally.</p><p>While these increases may sound small, minute changes in the Earth's temperature can have dramatic impacts. These changes affect a variety of Earth's natural processes, as well as biological processes which we and other species depend on for survival.</p><p>\"When you think about it, climate change is impacting just about everything and everyone on the planet,\" said Dr. Leslie Duram, a professor of geography and environmental resources and the director of the Environmental Studies minor program at SIU. Duram cited present impacts we are seeing and expect to see worsen, including sea level rise, longer and more intense forest fire seasons, an increase in the intensity of hurricanes, changes in precipitation and drought patterns, and longer periods of temperature extremes. Beyond these natural processes, she also cited heat-related impacts on human health, the expansion of species like ticks which can spread disease and the extinction of entire species.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of these changes will now be unavoidable. Under the Paris Climate Agreement, almost every country agreed that the global temperature increase should be limited to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2\u00b0C), with hopes that it could be kept below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5\u00b0C). However, \"most of the science now is saying we won't be able to meet 2.7\u00b0F, so we're dealing with 3.6\u00b0F already,\" noted Duram, \"and if we continue to emit greenhouse gasses at the level where we are now, we still will rise beyond the 3.6\u00b0F.\"</p><p>While it may be difficult to comprehend the full level of consequences which will result from climate change, understanding the magnitude of its impacts is essential for ensuring that we are working to address it and doing so in a just way.</p><p>Typically, speaking on the catastrophic nature of the problem has led to political action and greater public advocacy for addressing the crisis.</p><p>\"I think right now we're seeing a shift in public opinion that says we need to address it, but that's because of the accelerating crises,\" said Dr. Dustin Greenwalt, an SIU assistant professor of practice with a specialization in Environmental Communications. Greenwalt references how catastrophic rhetoric has inspired political action through groups such as Extinction Rebellion and Rising Tide North America.</p><p>\"One of the really famous moments was [when] the people of Tuvalu came to the United Nations,\" Dr. Greenwalt noted. \"Tuvalu is an island in the South Pacific that is at sea level, and Tuvalu barely exists anymore, people are already climate refugees. And those sorts of moments bubbled up into a broader kind of recognition.\"</p><p>Despite the importance of not hiding the reality of the crisis, some individuals faced with the magnitude of climate change's potentially devastating impacts can develop feelings of hopelessness or depression. This may arise from dread of personal impacts, a sense that the issue is out of their hands, or a sense the political factors may keep them from being able to help solve the issue.</p><p>\"If you just talk about problems, then people just feel hopeless, and they feel almost unable to address the problem,\" Duram said. \"So, it's very important that in addition to teaching about the problems, we teach solutions.\"</p><p>She noted that speaking about clean energy, new technology for addressing climate challenges, actions that individuals can take and how to educate others all serve to help individuals get beyond these feelings of hopelessness by demonstrating that progress is possible and being made.</p><p>Duram also stressed the importance of voting in addressing climate change, in addition to individual action. On a big picture level, she points out, we need policies and systemwide changes which require politicians who will take action. Beyond this, she stressed the importance of identifying ways to make climate change more individualized and finding a way to incorporate climate change adaptation or awareness into things they deal with in their daily lives, such as in planning infrastructure and in medical care.</p><p>However, further feelings of hopelessness can arrive when voting either fails to produce results in a timely manner, or not at all. While still essential in gaining institutional support, voting alone may not meaningfully address peoples' desire to see action.</p><p>\"I think that people feel like, generally, there is a crisis of political representation in our society,\" Greenwalt added. \"I think that [climate change] is a part of the broader set of crises, economic, political, and ecological, that they're facing and don't feel like the government is going to take meaningful action, and they haven't been offered alternatives.\"</p><p>As viable alternatives, Greenwalt highlighted the importance of building movements and organizations which advocate and protest for action, along with building more resiliency in their local communities and taking steps to stop further expansion of fossil fuel production and infrastructure. As examples, he pointed to climate justice causes such as addressing the disparity between emissions (greatest in the global north) and impacts (greatest in the global south), and more localized movements such as the current push to protect Atlanta Forest in Georgia, which is currently being targeted for development.</p><p>Overall, the best way to overcome the feeling that climate change presents a hopeless challenge is to get involved in addressing it. This may be voting for candidates who will act on climate change, helping to inform and educate others, engaging in protest and advocacy, or finding local groups who are working to ensure their own communities are able to adapt and support each other. The worst option is to let this hopelessness cause inaction, which only serves to reinforce those feelings.</p><p>(Editor's note: Isaac Ludington is a law student at SIU, but his writing should not be seen as a reflection of the opinion of the School of Law, or taken as legal advice.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5493808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67S6-54W1-JBSN-32HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1209\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Egyptian: Southern Illinois University, Carbondale</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 13, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Carbondale</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>IL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl for the past 10 days. They contained the initial blazes, but new fires raged closer to the decommissioned plant. </p><p>Emergencies Service chief Mykola Chechetkin reported to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that rains helped firefighters put out the flames, but acknowledged that it would take a few more days to extinguish smoldering grass. Chechetkin said emergency workers have prevented the fire from engulfing radioactive waste depots and other facilities in Chernobyl. The 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave. Ukraine's emergencies service said radiation levels in the capital, Kyiv, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the plant, were within norms after the forest fires. President Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians not to panic. \"We all remember the lessons of April 26, 1986,\" he said in an online statement Tuesday. \"No one is hiding the truth from you. Right now the truth is that the situation there is under control.\" On Monday, activists warned that the blazes were getting dangerously close to waste storage facilities. Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, a member of the public council under the state agency in charge of the closed zone around the plant, said one fire was raging within 2 kilometers (about 1.2 miles) from one of the radioactive waste depots. Last week, officials said they tracked down a person suspected of triggering the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to spread quickly. On Monday, police said that another local resident burned waste and accidentally set dry grass ablaze, triggering another devastating forest fire. They said he failed to report the fire to the authorities. Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence. They often start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring \u2014 a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations that often leads to devastating forest fires.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associated Press A forest fire is seen Friday burning near the plant inside the exclusion zone.

The Government of Canada is investing in revitalizing our forest ecosystems - including by planting two billion trees. As part of this initiative, communities and industries from coast to coast to coast are raising saplings, planting trees and bringing innovative technologies to the table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Remotely piloted aircraft systems, such as drones, are used in various sectors across our economy, from delivery methods to search and rescue operations. Now, they are making their mark in Canada's forest sector.</p><p>Today, Peter Fonseca, Member of Parliament for Mississauga East-Cooksville, on behalf of the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, announced a contribution of over $1.3 million to Flash Forest, a company that uses drone technology for tree planting. A total of over one million trees are set to be planted by Flash Forest over the next two years.</p><p>Using new technology in an effort to innovate and improve tree-planting initiatives in Canada, Flash Forest uses drones, advanced seed pods, automation and machine learning to plant in some of the most severe forest fire sites across Canada.</p><p>The sites will be monitored for germination success and to obtain survival data on the success of using drones for planting instead of traditional tree-planting methods. The project will use rapid drone deployment technology using AI, biological seed pods and robotic process automation to improve germination and the survival of temperate and boreal tree species in Canada.</p><p>Once seed pods are planted, forest growth will be monitored over consecutive seasons. The reforestation method employed by Flash Forest, which aims to plant at least 10 times faster than traditional methods and significantly cut costs, allows for rapid post-wildfire response within months of the fire, higher biodiversity and data-driven ecosystem restoration.</p><p>The federal contribution is made through the 2 Billion Trees program (2BT), which supports tree-planting projects with the aim of planting two billion trees over 10 years and helps to advance the nature-based solutions needed to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"The challenges presented to us by climate change and biodiversity loss are urgent. That's why the Government of Canada is working with Flash Forest to deploy tree-planting and monitoring drones at sites across Canada. By using drones, we can plant more swiftly, efficiently and effectively, making it easier to grow our forests, clean our air, support important habitats for wildlife and restore valuable ecosystems.\"</p><p>- The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources</p><p>\"Today we announced an investment of $1.3 million in Mississauga's Flash Forest for their innovative drone-based tree-planting strategy. The planting of trees in remote forests and following forest fires is a critical part of ensuring that Canada's forests remain vibrant and healthy for generations to come.\"</p><p>- Peter Fonseca, Member of Parliament for Mississauga East-Cooksville</p><p>\"We know that healthy forests support biodiversity, clean the air and create beautiful natural spaces for our communities to enjoy here in Mississauga-Erin Mills and everywhere. That's why I'm proud to be at University of TorontoMississauga as our government announces a contribution of $1.3 million to Flash Forest through the 2 Billion Trees program. These are the types of innovative climate solutions we need to continue protecting our ecosystems and achieve our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.\"</p><p>- Iqra Khalid, Member of Parliament for Mississauga-Erin Mills</p><p>\"Flash Forest is honoured to be working with the Government of Canada on an initiative as imperative as the 2 Billion Trees program. After seeing first-hand the impact of wildfire on our Canadian landscapes, we've never been more motivated to get trees in the ground faster. This partnership will allow us to double down on our aerial reforestation efforts and ensure Canadian forests remain an integral part of the global fight against climate change.\"</p><p>- Bryce Jones, CEO, Flash Forest</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2022/10/tree-planting-drones-to-revitalize-reforestation-efforts-in-areas-affected-by-wildfires.html\">https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2022/10/tree-planting-drones-to-revitalize-reforestation-efforts-in-areas-affected-by-wildfires.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7971895 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7971895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66M5-J6J1-JC11-13JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 14, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Meanwhile, another contract will provide extended and enhanced in-service support (ISS) contract for Sea Viper for a further five years. MBDA is the prime contractor and design authority for the Sea Viper weapon system, including the sensor (radar), the command and control system, and the missile.</p><p>Chris Allam, Managing Director of MBDA UK, said: \"These contracts will make Sea Viper the most capable naval air defence system ever developed for the Royal Navy in our 60 year history as the Navy's primary air defence system supplier. They will also see the UK further enhance the co-operation with France and Italy through MBDA by joining the Aster 30 Block 1 programme, giving the UK the ability to defeat anti-ship ballistic missiles.\"</p><p>The main element of Sea Viper Evolution will see the Royal Navy's existing Aster 30 missiles receive upgraded Block 1 warheads and new guidance and seeker software to deal with new anti-ship ballistic missile threats, whilst retaining its world leading anti-air warfare capability. The Type 45's Sampson multi-function radar, and combat management system will also be upgraded.

Flexrotor is a small tactical unmanned aerial system designed for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions at sea and over land.</p><p>\"We are looking forward to welcoming Aerovel into the Airbus family. This strategic acquisition aligns with our vision to expand our UAS offering and respond to a growing customer demand worldwide for additional mission capabilities such as manned-unmanned teaming. Aerovel's expertise in autonomous flight technology will undoubtedly complement our UAS development with the VSR700, as well as the work that we have been doing to develop interoperability,\" said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.</p><p>\"Joining forces with Airbus will allow us to scale innovation, accelerate our mission to advance unmanned aviation, and maintain our unwavering support for the US military and its allies. We are proud to become part of an organisation with a rich legacy of aerospace excellence and we look forward to leveraging our combined strengths to define the future of autonomous systems. It will also be a great tribute to our Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Tad McGeer, who has spent the last 30 years committed to delivering innovative unmanned products,\" said Ali Dian, CEO of Aerovel.</p><p>The Flexrotor, a modern Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aircraft with a maximum launch weight of 25 kg, has been designed for ISTAR missions for more than 12-14 hours in a typical operational configuration. It can integrate different types of payloads including an electro-optical system and advanced sensors to suit customers' unique mission needs. With the ability to autonomously launch and recover from either land or sea requiring only a 12 by 12 ft. area for launch and recovery, the Flexrotor is ideal for expeditionary missions requiring minimal footprint. Through the support of the US Department of Defense (DoD), and contracted deployment in a variety of maritime security exercises, the Flexrotor is a mission-proven, force multiplier for operations in harsh, high-threat, GPS-denied environments. The Flexrotor can also be used for parapublic missions such as forest fire surveillance (providing firefighters with critical images day or night) and ice navigation (helping guide naval vessels through ice in the Arctic ocean).</p><p>Aerovel, based in Bingen, Washington, will remain a US-owned company and continue collaboration with the US DoD under Airbus' Special Security Agreement (SSA).</p><p>The acquisition has been approved by the relevant bodies of both companies. It remains subject to regulatory approvals, as well as other customary conditions.

In this respect, anomaly detection methods are needed to ensure an assessment of such systems. In this article, we propose a rule-based method for data integrity assessment, with rules built from the system technical specifications and by domain experts, and formalised by a logic-based framework, resulting in the triggering of situation-specific alerts. A use case is proposed on the Automatic Identification System, a worldwide localisation system for vessels, based on its poor level of security which allows errors, falsifications and spoofing scenarios. The discovery of abnormal reporting cases aims to assist marine traffic surveillance, preserve the human life at sea and mitigate hazardous behaviours against ports, off-shore structures and the environment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420300452#!\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420300452#!</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Global arms trade falls slightly, but imports to Europe, East Asia and Oceania rise - 14/3/2022</p><p>(Stockholm, 14 March 2022) International transfers of major arms saw a slight drop between 2012-16 and 2017-21 (-4.6 per cent). Nevertheless, exports by the United States and  France  increased substantially, as did imports to states in Europe (+19 per cent), East Asia (+20 per cent) and Oceania (+59 per cent). Transfers to the Middle East remained high, while those to Africa and the Americas decreased, according to new data on global arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).</p><p>'The small decrease in global arms transfers masks large variations between regional trends,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'Whereas there were some positive developments, including South American arms imports reaching their lowest level in 50 years, increasing or continuing high rates of weapons imports to places like Europe, East Asia, Oceania and the Middle East contributed to worrying arms build-ups.'</p><p>Europe sees biggest growth in arms imports</p><p>The biggest growth in arms imports among world regions occurred in Europe. In 2017-21 imports of major arms by European states were 19 per cent higher than in 2012-16 and accounted for 13 per cent of global arms transfers. The largest arms importers in Europe were the United Kingdom, Norway and the Netherlands. Other European states are also expected to increase their arms imports significantly over the coming decade, having recently placed large orders for major arms, in particular combat aircraft from the USA. Despite armed conflict in eastern Ukraine throughout 2017-21, the country's imports of major arms in the period were very limited.</p><p>'The severe deterioration in relations between most European states and Russia was an important driver of growth in European arms imports, especially for states that cannot meet all their requirements through their national arms industries,' said Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'Arms transfers also play an important role in transatlantic security relationships.'</p><p>US,  French arms exports rise  ; Russian, Chinese and German arms exports fall</p><p>Arms exports by the USA grew by 14 per cent between 2012-16 and 2017-21, increasing its global share from 32 per cent to 39 per cent. Arms exports by the USA in 2017-21 were more than double (108 per cent more) those of the second largest exporter, Russia. The Middle East accounted for 43 per cent of US arms transfers. Especially important for the growth of US arms exports was an increase in deliveries of major arms to Saudi Arabia, by 106 per cent.</p><p>Russia, which accounted for 19 per cent of all exports of major arms in 2017-21, saw its exports shrink by 26 per cent between 2012-16 and 2017-21. The overall decrease in Russia's arms exports was almost entirely due to a fall in arms deliveries to two recipients: India and Viet Nam. However, several large arms deliveries from Russia to India are expected in the coming years.</p><p>France  accounted for 11 per cent of global arms exports in 2017-21, making it the third largest arms exporter. France increased its arms exports by 59 per cent between 2012-16 and 2017-21.</p><p>In 2017-21 China was the fourth largest arms exporter and Germany the fifth largest. Arms exports by China decreased by 31 per cent between 2012-16 and 2017-21, while Germany's arms exports fell by 19 per cent.</p><p>Source SIPRI</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2022/global-arms-trade-falls-slightly-imports-europe-east-asia-and-oceania-rise\">https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2022/global-arms-trade-falls-slightly-imports-europe-east-asia-and-oceania-rise</url></p><p>Defence industries and technologies</p><p>The diplomatic network, an irreplaceable channel of information and influence at the service of defence industries</p><p>In order to translate its political will to include government support in military export industrial projects, a core component of our bilateral relations, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs has put its diplomatic network to work for our national defence and security interests. This legitimatizes it role of coordinator of the various stakeholders including those working in government, Parliament, industry and civil society who are interested in defence and security, which are at the heart of the most important economic, industrial, social, and especially political and strategic problems.</p><p>An esteemed interlocutor of local authorities and point of contact for our manufacturers working abroad, the role of the French diplomatic network is to</p><p>analyse and convey the needs of local authorities in terms of equipment, oversight and offsets; and monitor and provide local government support for industrial projects.</p><p>The French diplomatic network also provides local support to French manufacturers, in particular SMEs, offering to provide advice and network with local authorities.</p><p>France and Europe, leaders in defence and security</p><p>With 5,000 companies and 400,000 jobs in the defence sector (including 165,000 direct jobs in the armament industry), French industry accounts for over 25% of European capabilities.</p><p>As the European defence industry is being established, European industries, and French industries in particular, need to offset the significant difference between European and American funds with their exports.</p><p>Against this backdrop, cooperation programmes help develop a European defence identity via a unique European offering to export to the international market.</p><p>The European Union is responsible for a third of global arms deliveries (especially France, Germany and the United Kingdom). Although in the last ten years, the United States, the European Union, Russia and Israel shared 90% of the market, new competitors, including South Korea, China and Turkey, are clearly striving to position themselves in the armament market over the long term.</p><p>The main companies of the French defence industry\u2014Dassault Aviation, Naval Group, Airbus Group, MBDA, Nexter, Safran and Thales\u2014are European and even global leaders and have a strong presence at international arms fairs such as the International Paris Air Show, Eurosatory, Euronaval and Milipol Paris, which attract several thousands of visitors to France.</p><p>Main features of the arms market</p><p>The crisis has exacerbated competition. The number of orders from major customers in the arms market (in particular Middle Eastern oil companies) has decreased while new players have reached the maturity it takes to become serious contenders on the international export market, which means new partnerships need to be forged.</p><p>Big contracts (+\u20ac150 million) account for half of the global market in monetary terms, in particular in the aviation sector, which makes up 60% of the market.</p><p>For all countries, large-scale procurement is a an essentially political choice, and serves as a test of the quality of bilateral relations with the main exporting countries. France exports a full range of defence systems and such procurement provides an opportunity to create or to strengthen long-term partnerships.</p><p>States are the only ones responsible for monitoring arms transfers and use their exports as a means to conduct foreign policy.</p><p>States are likewise industrial players. Political choices of a defence posture and of the degree of autonomy determine the scale of the development efforts of their industrial and technological base and the amount of technological research financing, which is essential to this high-tech sector.</p><p>The French and European arms industry</p><p>Coordination of arms procurement</p><p>The coordination of European arms procurement policies is a natural and crucial way to reinforce the Common Security and Defence Policy. From the outset, France, a firm promoter of the capability approach to consolidate the respective defence efforts of European Union Member States and boost the synergy of their national and multinational projects, has worked to help establish the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR), which became a legal entity in January 2001.</p><p>France is involved in many European cooperation programmes regarding Tiger and NH90 helicopters, Cobra radar, the range of future surface-to-air systems (FSAF), the A400M ATLAS transport aircraft and multipurpose frigates (FREMM). It has also supported the enhancement of this cooperation through the creation of an agency in the area of defence capability development (European Defence Agency-EDA), decided at the Thessaloniki European Council meeting in June 2003. The EDA is jointly helping to harmonize armament needs and employment conditions in developing a common concept for the Rapid Reaction Force, which are essential for a more comprehensive integration of European armed forces.</p><p>In addition to these cooperation programmes, France actively defends the need to strengthen the European Industrial and Technological Base, which is unique in that it ensures the European Union's industrial and technological base of defence equipment over the long term.</p><p>Source: Diplomatie.Gouv.fr</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/economic-diplomacy-foreign-trade/supporting-french-businesses-abroad/strategic-sector-support/defence-industries-and/\">https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/economic-diplomacy-foreign-trade/supporting-french-businesses-abroad/strategic-sector-support/defence-industries-and/</url></p><p>The Commission for Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies (CEA)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/cea/the-cea-a-key-player-in-technological-research.aspx\">The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) is a key player in research, development and innovation in four main areas: defence and security, low carbon energies (nuclear and renewable energies), technological research for industry, fundamental research in the physical sciences and life sciences.</url></p><p>Source: CEA</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cea.fr/english\">http://www.cea.fr/english</url></p><p>Leading Companies</p><p>Airbus (XPAR: AIR)</p><p>About Airbus</p><p>Airbus is an international reference in the aerospace sector.

The nine-month earnings reflect higher commercial aircraft deliveries, the good performance in helicopters as well as charges linked to the reassessment of certain satellite development programmes,\" said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. \"Demand for our commercial aircraft is very strong with a continuing recovery in the widebody market. We expect the supply chain to remain challenging as we progress on the production ramp-up. In that context, we maintain our guidance for the full year.\"</p><p>Gross commercial aircraft orders totalled 1,280 (9m 2022: 856 aircraft) with net orders of 1,241 aircraft after cancellations (9m 2022: 647 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,992 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2023. Airbus Helicopters registered 191 net orders (9m 2022: 246 units) which were well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space's order intake by value was \u20ac 8.5 billion (9m 2022: \u20ac 8.0 billion), including the renewal of the in-service support contract for Germany's A400M fleet.</p><p>Consolidated  revenues  increased 12 percent year-on-year to \u20ac 42.6 billion (9m 2022: \u20ac 38.1 billion). A total of 488 commercial aircraft were delivered (9m 2022: 437  (1)(2)  aircraft), comprising 41 A220s, 391 A320 Family, 20 A330s and 36 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus' commercial aircraft activities increased 18 percent, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries. Airbus Helicopters' deliveries increased slightly to 197 units (9m 2022: 193 units) with revenues rising 3 percent, reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space decreased 6 percent, mainly driven by a backloaded A400M delivery profile and updated Estimates at Completion of certain satellite development programmes. A total of 4 A400M military airlifters were delivered (9m 2022: 7 aircraft).</p><p>Consolidated  EBIT Adjusted  - an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses - was \u20ac 3,631 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 3,481 million).</p><p>EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus' commercial aircraft activities increased to \u20ac 3,216 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 2,875 million), reflecting the higher deliveries and a more favourable hedge rate, partially offset by investments for preparing the future. 9m 2022 included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations partly offset by the impact resulting from international sanctions against Russia. In H1 2023 provisions were released to reflect further progress made on compliance-related topics.</p><p>The ramp-up on the A220 programme is continuing towards a monthly production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026. Production on the A320 Family programme is progressing well towards the previously announced rate of 75 aircraft per month in 2026. The modernisation and digitalisation of the industrial system continues, as illustrated by the inauguration of the A321XLR equipment installation hangar in Hamburg. The A321XLR is progressing towards certification, with entry-into-service expected to take place in Q2 2024.</p><p>On widebody aircraft, the Company has decided to increase the production rate for the A350 to 10 aircraft a month in 2026 and continues to target rate 4 for the A330 in 2024.</p><p>Airbus Helicopters' EBIT Adjusted increased to \u20ac 417 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 380 million), reflecting the overall performance across programmes and services. 9m 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.</p><p>EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to \u20ac -1 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 231 million). It included charges of \u20ac 0.4 billion related to updated Estimates at Completion of certain satellite development programmes, mostly recorded in the third quarter. 9m 2022 also included net positive non-recurring elements.</p><p>On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. No further net material impact was recognised in the first nine months of 2023. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing overall volume as per the revised baseline.</p><p>In order to cope with an evolving defence and security environment, the Company has launched a transformation of its Defence and Space division. This aims to adapt ways of working, focusing on rigorous programme execution and a rebalancing of risks and opportunities to reinforce end-to-end accountability and ownership in the business lines and improve competitiveness.</p><p>Consolidated  self-financed R&amp;D expenses  totalled \u20ac 2,167 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 1,965 million).</p><p>Consolidated  EBIT (reported)  amounted to \u20ac 2,712 million (9m 2022: \u20ac 3,552 million), including net Adjustments of \u20ac -919 million.</p><p>These Adjustments comprised:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>    \u20ac -806 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which \u20ac -155 million were in Q3.

The Statutory Auditors have performed a limited review of these consolidated financial statements and have expressed an unqualified opinion.</p><p>\"The global context remains marked by the war in Ukraine and the associated instability.</p><p>In the business jet market, the post-Covid upturn in growth witnessed in 2022 began to ease off in the last quarter of 2022, a slowdown that continued in the 1  st  half of this year.</p><p>The Rafale's success is still generating new prospects for Export. Post-closing, the announcement on July 13  th  by the Indian Government of the selection of the Navy Rafale to equip the Indian Navy with a latest generation fighter illustrates this success.</p><p>Following an international competition launched by the Indian authorities, this decision comes after a successful trial campaign held in India, during which the Navy Rafale demonstrated that it fully met the Indian Navy's operational requirements and was perfectly suited to the specificities of its aircraft carrier.</p><p>The Indian Navy's 26 Rafale will eventually join the 36 Rafale already in service, making India the first country to make the same military choice as France by operating both versions of the aircraft (Navy and Air Force).</p><p>This selection confirms the excellence of the Rafale, the exceptional quality of the link between Dassault Aviation and the Indian Forces, and the importance of the strategic relationship between India and France.</p><p>In France, the Military Programming Law (\"LPM\") voted on July 13  th  includes the 42 aircraft of the 5  th  batch of the Rafale (out of which 20 are to be delivered between 2027 and 2030, which will make the fleet of the French Air and Space Force reach 137 Rafale), the Rafale F5 standard which includes the development of a drone derived from the works of the nEUROn demonstrator, the pursuit of FCAS/NGF, the decision for the launch of a successor to the ATL2 in 2024, and the activation of the options for 5 Falcon 2000 AVSIMAR and for a 3  rd  Falcon 8X Archange.</p><p>Like most other players in the sector, we face supply chain issues. The situation has deteriorated further since 2022. We are striving to limit the negative impact of this by keeping a closer eye on our suppliers' production.</p><p>This situation has an impact on the development and production of our aircraft, while we need to ramp up to meet our commitments.</p><p>The Paris Air Show was highly appreciated with an important visitor numbers on trade and general public days. It was an opportunity for meetings and discussions with government and foreign delegations. The popularity of our aircraft was illustrated by the success of the Rafale: in flight (demonstration), at the static display (new simulator) and on the stand (Rafale Export mock-ups), the impact of the multi-mission Falcon (Albatros, Japan Coast Guards, Archange, Falcon Fire Fighter, etc.), the strong impression made by the Falcon 6X (in flight and on static display) and by the Falcon 10X mock-up, with prospects from all around the world. The airshow has been the opportunity to disclose our actions toward decarbonation (SAF, etc.) and to lead ambitious recruitment operations: \u00ab L'Avion des m\u00e9tiers \u00bb, \u00ab l'a\u00e9ro recrute \u00bb, JobDating, HR spaces and Academic Relations.</p><p>In a tight job market, the Group keeps on having an ambitious recruitment policy, with a target of 1,400 person hired, out of which 1,000 for the parent company. The sharing value remains at the heart of Dassault Aviation DNA. For the parent company, the salary increase was 6.2%, with a uniform general increase of \u20ac140 gross/month on January 1, 2023. Due to the profit-sharing agreement, 93% of employees has received a minimum of 4 months of extra wage in 2023.</p><p>The environment remains a major issue for the Group, which is working to reduce the carbon impact of its industrial processes and aircraft. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), the energy saving plan and the development of tools to improve flight plans are levers to be among the first in the aviation industry to become carbon neutral. Business aviation is not included in the EU taxonomy, unlike commercial aviation.</p><p>This is particularly disappointing given that business aviation is paving the way: Falcon flights operated by Dassault Aviation already fly on 30% SAF; they could fly on 50% SAF today if those blends were available. Falcon 10X will be the first 100% SAF compatible Falcon. In the United States, industries are receiving subsidies and making rapid progress; Europe is putting less money on the table and imposing standards. We are considering legal actions for breach of the principle of equality while business aviation has begun its decarbonization.</p><p>In the military sector, during the 1  st  half, we delivered 4 Rafale (2 Export and 2 France) and 4 pre-owned Rafale to Greece, and provided support to the French and export fleets. We also continued the development work on the F4 standard and negotiations and business development for the Rafale.</p><p>Regarding the FCAS, for which Dassault Aviation is lead contractor for the New Generation Fighter demonstrator, work on phase 1B has begun in March. The teams of German and Spanish manufacturers are on site, alongside the Group's employees, at the dedicated physical workspace created in Saint-Cloud.</p><p>For multi-mission aircraft, we delivered the 1  st  of the 4 Falcon 2000 ordered by Republic of Korea in 2022, and the 7  th  and last ATL2 modernized by Dassault Aviation to France. We continued the development works on the Archange and Albatros programs, and began working on the architectural design based on the Falcon 10X for a future maritime patrol aircraft, a project on which we are competing with Airbus. We also unveiled the mock-up at the Paris Air Show of a firefighting specialized Falcon project: the \"Falcon Fire Fighter\".</p><p>In the civil sector, in the 1  st  half of 2023, we recorded 12 Falcon orders, compared with 41 in the 1  st  half of 2022 and we delivered 9 Falcon, compared with 14 in the 1st half of 2022.</p><p>Test flights for the Falcon 6X have been completed. The aircraft was showcased with its cabin fitted out at EBACE and at the Paris Air Show; its demo flight was one of the highlights of the Paris Air Show. We are awaiting its certification to start the deliveries.</p><p>Development of the Falcon 10X is ongoing (the detailed technical specification phase has been completed) and we are now in the industrialization and early manufacturing phase.</p><p>In a challenging supply chain environment, our 2023 guidance remains unchanged: delivery of 15 Rafale and 35 Falcon (including Falcon 6X); decrease in net sales compared with last year.\"</p><p>\u00c9ric TRAPPIER, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation.</p><p>ORDER INTAKE</p><p>Order intake  for the first half of 2023 was  EUR 1,682 million  , vs. EUR 16,290 million in the first half of 2022.

Co-operation is what allowed us to deliver our strong performance in 2022. Today more than ever, in this deeply troubled international context, we can see how it is through co-operation that we will prevail, support the reinforcement of our countries' sovereignty, and help ensure the safety of our people.\"</p><p>Co-operation in programmes and technology</p><p>MBDA contributes to European air defence security through the comprehensive solutions offered to counter the whole range of air threats, from long-range ballistic missiles to very small unmanned aircraft. Air defence systems operating the Aster missiles are deployed in France, Italy and the UK, on both ships and on land systems such as the SAMP/T, which was recently sent to Ukraine's borders. Its next generation, SAMP/T NG, continued to advance in 2022 and will be delivered to Italy and France by 2025 and available for export in 2026. Co-operation in air defence is also built around another emblematic co-operation programme between Italy and the UK, CAMM and CAMM-ER, for which in 2022 MBDA received an order for the Italian Army and the Italian Air Force. Progress was also made on Sky Warden, our flagship solution to counter unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), a modular scalable system designed to integrate and control multiple sensors and effectors. Sky Warden can address all threats from small aircraft to very small drones, of which we have seen growing use of recently in conflicts in Europe and elsewhere.</p><p>In the field of deep strike and heavy anti-ship weapons, 2022 saw the next phase launched of the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) between France and the United Kingdom, focusing on the co-ordinated development of the programme, and re-confirmed last week during the Franco-British summit in Paris. Future air combat also stands as a priority for MBDA, being involved in the two major programmes: Germany, France and Spain continued to advance on the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project for which MBDA is responsible for new Remote Carrier effectors and brings its expertise on connected collaborative combat; and with the Global Combat Air Programme, backed by the UK, Italy and Japan, for which MBDA is the effects domain leader. On the innovation side, good progress was made in 2022 on laser directed energy weapons, with the recent acquisition of Cilas in France, the successful trials of Dragonfire in the UK and of the new tracking technology for high-energy laser (HEL) in Germany.</p><p>Co-operation of cultures and expertise</p><p>MBDA was founded on the strong willingness of nations to co-operate, this is our strength and is what makes us successful. It is through the interaction of different cultures, different know-how and different ways of working, while respecting national priorities, that MBDA developed itself as an integrated European company. Investment in people to drive innovation and delivery remains a core focus for MBDA, with a company record-breaking 1,570 new people joining the group in 2022, and a plan to recruit more than 2,000 new employees in 2023.</p><p>Outside our domestic countries, among the major export contracts signed in 2022 were the weapon packages for the UAE's new Rafale aircraft, the weapon packages for Greece's new frigates and Rafale aircraft, and the CAMM missile contract in Poland.</p><p>Performance</p><p>In total, revenues in 2022 were \u20ac4.2 billion, consistent with 2021's record level.

The operational milestones, both in France and internationally, have all been met. Among the most striking illustrations, we are proud to have launched the Suffren, the first next-generation SSN, and to have cut the first metal sheet for the defence and intervention frigate (FDI), a digital frigate intended for the French Navy. Internationally, we have delivered the Khanderi to the Indian Navy but also signed the design contract for the Australian Future Submarine program. We are benefiting from a dynamic market situation and, despite increasingly fierce competition, we won bids for more than twenty ships in five new countries. We also play a pivotal role in European alliances and have set up Naviris, a joint company with Fincantieri, our long-standing Italian partner. Our operational and financial performance enables us to guarantee our ability to finance the future long-term growth of the company.\"</p><p>Frank Le Rebeller, Senior Executive Vice President Finance, Legal, Purchasing and Real Estate, added: \"Order intake in 2019 reached record levels. The results for the 2019 reporting period (produced according to IFRS standards and in particular the IFRS 15 standard since 2018), for the fifth consecutive year, show progress in sales, which stand at 3.7 billion euros, along with an improvement of operating profitability, which has shown a steady increase since 2015 and this year reached 7.6%. Consolidated net income (group share) amounts to nearly 190 million euros, thus raising our equity to 1.2 billion euros. These results are slightly over than our targets. They reflect a solid financial situation, more particularly characterised by levels of profitability in line with our targets and a robust level of equity that has been reconstituted over the past four years. We continued our overall investment efforts, which increased to nearly 480 million euros, in particular in innovation, R&amp;D and digitisation. Our development is creating significant need for recruitment and in 2019 we welcomed 1,500 new colleagues.\"</p><p>Order intake: 5.3 billion euros (+44% vs 2018), including 3 billion internationally, raising the order book to 15 billion euros</p><p>The order intake over the 2019 reporting period amounts to 5.3 billion euros, boosting the order book which now stands at 15 billion euros. Orders recorded in France and overseas for the 2019 reporting period benefited all sectors. In France, in new construction, the main notifications concerned the sixth nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN) for the Barracuda program. The main contract awarded for new constructions internationally is the program for twelve minehunters and their toolboxes for the Belgian and Dutch navies. Finally, regarding services, several multi-year availability contracts were notified, notably the routine maintenance contract for the ballistic-missile submarines (SSBN) for 2020-2025, as well as the maintenance contract for the Egyptian Navy.</p><p>For the year 2019, the book-to-bill ratio (order intake divided by sales), which measures the order book's renewal rate, stands at 1.4, and at 1.2 for the past three years.</p><p>Activity: increased sales</p><p>The consolidated sales amount to 3,712 million euros. Its 3% increase over 2018 was driven by the major national programs, mainly the Barracuda program, the multimission frigates program and the defence and intervention frigates program. The Australian program also contributed to Naval Group sales. Finally, services represented a key component, with a 41% share. For France, they include in-service support for first rank surface ships and nuclear submarines of the French Navy. Internationally, they include the periodic docking for maintenance of the Malaysian submarines, as well as the adaptation and modernisation of the  Bouchard  corvette for the Argentinian Navy, delivered two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>Profitability: significant growth of EBITA and operating profit</p><p>EBITA (earnings before interest, tax and amortisation) totalled 282 million euros. Its progress compared to 2018 drives an increase in operating profitability, which has risen from 7.4% in 2018 to 7.6% in 2019, placing Naval Group as the leader of the naval defence sector in Europe.</p><p>This progression shows the operational improvement of all naval programs and the effectiveness of the improvement plans undertaken for over five years.</p><p>Group net income is 188.2 million euros, up by almost 10 million euros compared to 2018. This result increases the group's consolidated equity to 1.2 billion euros.</p><p>Strong prospects for 2020</p><p>In 2019, Naval Group hired more than 1,500 new staff, taking the group's total workforce to more than 15,000, presenting an increase of nearly 10% compared to 2018 levels. This trend will continue thanks in particular to numerous initiatives such as the opening of the arrangement designer school on the Cherbourg site and the Naval Industries Campus, which has been launched last November by the French Minister for Education.</p><p>Naval Group is also accelerating its investments, worth nearly 480 million euros, specifically targeting open and collaborative innovation, the development of international activities and trade relations, as well as industrial and IT equipment.</p><p>Lastly, thanks to its increased capacity to invest, Naval Group will pursue the internationalisation of its activity. This deployment will more specifically be driven by Naviris, its joint-venture with Fincantieri, which will allow a joint response to some calls for tender and sharing of R&amp;D activities for surface ships.</p><p>The prospects for 2020 are robust, with expected sales growth of about 5% and a rise in consolidated net income (group share) of about 10%.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.naval-group.com/en/news/naval-group-achieves-a-record-level-of-orders-in-2019/\">https://www.naval-group.com/en/news/naval-group-achieves-a-record-level-of-orders-in-2019/</url></p><p>SAFRAN (XPAR: SAF)</p><p>About Safran</p><p>Safran is an international high-technology group, operating in the aviation (propulsion, equipment and interiors), defense and space markets.

The milestone test launch, which is using patented solar and battery power, puts Sceye on track to expand internet access to remote populations, monitor greenhouse gasses down to individual emitters, and detect natural disasters as they begin. The company also announced additional test flights for Q3 and Q4 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sceye's HAPS launched at 6:55 AM MDT from the company's hangar at the Roswell International Airport.</p><p>\"Today's test flight holds extraordinary potential for stratospheric discovery,\" said Sceye founder and CEO, Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen. \"By maintaining position in the stratosphere for extended periods of time, we can begin realizing the promises of the stratosphere for life on Earth. Universal internet access, methane monitoring, and wildfire detection are all at our fingertips.\"</p><p>The launch objectives were to:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Test durability and performance of renewable power systems in the stratosphere</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Demonstrate the ability to stay over an area of operation</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Maintain a constant float altitude in the stratosphere</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Sceye's HAPS design, in the form of an enhanced balloon, can lift a variety of payloads for connectivity, earth observation, and scientific research. Its hull fabric can manage the extreme environment of the stratosphere, and optimizes strength, helium retention, and thermal management. High-performance batteries and solar panels close the power loop: enough power storage to last until sunrise, and efficient solar cells to collect energy during the day.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to see years of research and development culminating in this milestone moment,\" said David Kim, Sceye's Chief Technology Officer. \"It is the very best application of material science pushing the boundaries of near space.\"</p><p>Chief of Mission Operations, Stephanie Luongo, said, \"This launch is the second of six in our test program this year intended to verify payload and automated flight while ensuring safe operations. We're excited to learn more from upcoming flight tests planned for late summer and fall.\"</p><p>In October 2021, Sceye was the first to connect a Massive MIMO antenna with 3D beamforming from the stratosphere directly to smartphones on the ground over a 140 km distance - a world record in Open RAN. In March 2022, Sceye successfully validated its automated flight software which increases the reliability of its HAPS during its most critical phases of flight - launch and ascent.</p><p>Sceye has partnered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), New Mexico Economic Development Department, and New Mexico Environment Department on a five-year study to monitor air quality in the State of New Mexico. Sceye's HAPS will track methane emissions with a sub 1-m resolution, allowing them to determine pollution levels as well as pinpoint individual emitters.</p><p>About Sceye</p><p>Sceye is a material science company founded in 2014 to unleash the possibilities in the stratosphere by uplifting and connecting all people, and protecting our planet. The company has developed a new generation of stratospheric platforms to provide universal and equitable connectivity, improve climate change monitoring, natural resource stewardship, forest fire monitoring and better detect and contain disasters before they spiral out of control.</p><p>Sceye continues the humanitarian work of founder and CEO Mikkel Vestergaard Frandsen. As owner and former CEO of the public health companies Vestergaard and LifeStraw, he led innovations in material science that have saved millions of lives. LifeStraw water filters have helped nearly eradicate Guinea worm disease, and PermaNet, bed nets made from innovative fibers that release microscopic doses of insecticide, have helped reduce global malaria deaths by more than half.</p><p>View source version on businesswire.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220805005490/en/\">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220805005490/en/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:press@sceye.com\">press@sceye.com</url></p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BWIRE-20220805005490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6639-8DX1-DXY3-012N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7924</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><timeReceived>11:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Business Wire, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Business Wire</publicationName><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businesswire.com\">http://www.businesswire.com</url><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 5, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

'It had to be something that really resonated because I owe it to all of you guys and to myself,' Gellar noted. 'But there are so many more stories to tell, and utilizing the supernatural is how we explain the things that we can't really understand and the stories that we can't really grasp, or the ones that would be too depressing in real life or too upsetting.' <br/>'I didn't really intend to read it when they sent it to me initially,' Gellar said. 'And no offense, I'm a big fan, but I was like 'eh, not for me.'' Creator Jeff Davis chimed in, saying 'werewolves,' which caused Gellar to make a face. Clearly, the actor wasn't too thrilled at the idea of filming a series that featured wolves or werewolves. Still, Gellar noted that the script's utilization of deep themes around isolation and trauma, as well as the discussion of mental health, ultimately convinced her to take on the role. <br/> h-sarah-michelle-gellar-said-that-supernatural-roles-are-the-most-exciting-ones-for-womenSarah Michelle Gellar said that supernatural roles are the 'most exciting' ones for women<br/>     Wolf Pack | Full Panel NYCC 2022 | Paramount+925520<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hm7oBpH_js0?feature=oembed\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/hm7oBpH_js0?feature=oembed</url>\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen &gt;      <br/>Gellar is passionate about roles that allow women a chance to truly shine.

In a new study, a team of Michigan State University scientists designed and fabricated a remote forest fire detection and alarm system powered by nothing but the movement of the trees in the wind.</p><p>As detailed in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, the device, known as MC-TENG - short for multilayered cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) - generates electrical power by harvesting energy from the sporadic movement of the tree branches from which it hangs.</p><p>\"As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of such a novel MC-TENG as a forest fire detection system,\" said lead author Changyong Cao, who directs the Laboratory of Soft Machines and Electronics in MSU's School of Packaging and is an assistant professor in the Packaging School and Departments of Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p><p>\"The self-powered sensing system could continuously monitor the fire and environmental conditions without requiring maintenance after deployment,\" he said.</p><p>For Cao and his team, the tragic forest fires in recent years across the American West, Brazil and Australia were driving forces behind this new technology. Cao believes that early and quick response to forest fires will make the task of extinguishing them easier, significantly reducing the damage and loss of property and life.</p><p>Traditional forest fire detection methods include satellite monitoring, ground patrols, watch towers, among others, which have high labor and financial costs in return for low efficiency.</p><p>Current remote sensor technologies are becoming more common, but primarily rely on battery technology for power.</p><p>\"Although solar cells have been widely used for portable electronics or self-powered systems, it is challenging to install these in a forest because of the shading or covering of lush foliage,\" said Yaokun Pang, co-author and postdoc associate at Cao's lab.</p><p>TENG technology converts external mechanical energy - such as the movement of a tree branch - into electricity by way of the triboelectric effect, a phenomenon where certain materials become electrically charged after they separate from a second material with which they were previously in contact.</p><p>The simplest version of the TENG device consists of two cylindrical sleeves of unique material that fit within one another. The core sleeve is anchored from above while the bottom sleeve is free to slide up and down and move side to side, constrained only by an elastic connective band or spring. As the two sleeves move out of sync, the intermittent loss of contact generates electricity. The MC-TENG are equipped with several hierarchical triboelectric layers, increasing the electrical output.</p><p>The MC-TENG stores its sporadically generated electrical current in a carbon-nanotube-based micro supercapacitor. The researchers selected this technology for its rapid charge and discharge times, allowing the device to adequately charge with only short but sustained gusts of wind.</p><p>\"At a very low vibration frequency, the MC-TENG can efficiently generate electricity to charge the attached supercapacitor in less than three minutes,\" Cao said.</p><p>The researchers outfitted the initial prototype with both carbon monoxide (CO) and temperature sensors. The addition of a temperature sensor was intended to reduce the likelihood of a false positive carbon dioxide reading.</p><p>Research paper</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202006260215466564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6071-0FC1-JC3D-Y1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>self-powered-alarm-fights-forest-fires-monitors-environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001544</classCode><className>SECURITY &amp;

White House officials on the call unveiling the dashboard called it just part of the administration\u2019s climate agenda, along with funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as several executive orders and task forces aimed at climate change.<br/>Experts took a better-late-than-never stance on the dashboard, which they hope will help local governments better target their climate policies.<br/>Maya Golden-Krasner, deputy director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the tool will enable local leaders to \u201cget more bang for their buck\u201d by directing resources to the areas most vulnerable to climate disasters.<br/>In addition to real-time information, the dashboard lets users peek into the climate future for a given county, Census tract or tribal. It provides early-, mid- and late-century climate projections through 2099, with two scenarios for each time frame: One based on whether emission levels rise for the rest of the century and the other showing what might happen if emissions fall.<br/>Users can alsofilter the projectionsbetween five different climate hazards: extreme heat, drought, wildfire, flooding and coastal inundation.<br/>While they appreciate the scope of the data, some experts worried that by placing the hazards in separate categories, the tool misrepresents how intertwined they all are.<br/>\u201cIf you have a drought, you may well have a forest fire, and then you may have an air quality problem and you may damage the electric grid,\u201d said Kathy Jacobs, director of the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions at the University of Arizona.<br/>She said that the tool does provide a clear picture of the damage climate change can inflict on the nation, a picture she and others hope will spur people to action.<br/>\u201cIt makes very quantitative conclusions about what the future is likely to look like in a high-emissions scenario, which hopefully is motivating,\u201d Jacobs said.<br/>But even in isolation, the numbers are jarring. For example, the higher-emissions scenario on the dashboard projects that Maricopa County could have an average of 122.4 days per year above 105 degrees between 2070 and 2099. By comparison, Phoenix in 2021 had 104 days above 100 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.<br/>Projections also show that the risk of wildfire will increase across the state, predicting that the number of days with less than 0.01 inches of precipitation will increase. Maricopa County would experience 297.7 such dry days per year by 2099, compared to 285.5 on average between 1976 and 2005.<br/>The launch comes as Arizona is gripped by a range of extreme weather events. Extreme heat continues to hammer the state and a 22-year drought, considered to be the most-severe in 1,200 years, has led to historically low water levels on the Colorado River, among other effects.<br/>\u201cWe see impacts on a daily basis in our community,\u201d Gallego said. \u201cIt shows up in terms of drought, intense moments of heat as well as flash flooding. \u201d<br/>\u00a0<br/></p><p>Copyright \u00a9 2022 BridgeTower Media.

What happens when he turns up the pressure?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW YORK - There's something eating at New York City Mayor Eric Adams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His name is Brad Lander.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several times over the last year, Adams has launched into diatribes against the city comptroller, a little-known position outside the five boroughs that commands expansive oversight powers over the executive branch. During his 1.5 years in office, Lander has served as a rhetorical counterbalance to City Hall messaging and penned reports highlighting shortfalls in governance. Last week, he released his first major audit of the administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The mayor has not been a fan. While unveiling the city's $107 billion budget last week, Adams went out of his way to needle the Brooklyn progressive. And during a media briefing weeks before that, he lit up New York City political Twitter by mocking Lander with an unflattering impersonation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The episodes have cast the progressive ombudsman of city government as the moderate mayor's archrival - even as Lander has been cautious in his approach. And the increasing tension is setting up a broader collision course between the left and center factions of the local Democratic Party.</p><p>\"If Brad Lander decides to really go to war with the mayor, he can be so much more aggravating to him,\" Chris Coffey, a Democratic political strategist who worked for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said. \"On the flip side, Brad makes a pretty good punching bag for a mayor who is at times at odds with the organized left.\"</p><p>What comes next could impact Adams' reelection bid, arm the left wing of the party with institutional firepower and provide a platform for the comptroller to potentially mount a mayoral campaign of his own down the road.</p><p>\"Having the numbers and the proof in the pudding puts Brad in a position of power,\" said Camille Rivera, a progressive strategist who did a stint in the de Blasio administration. \"And that makes him a de facto leader in the progressive party.\"</p><p>Both Adams' and Lander's offices declined to comment on the growing rift between the two citywide politicians, who took very different paths as they came up through the cutthroat world of Brooklyn politics.</p><p>In 2009, Lander - who is as reserved as Adams is outspoken - won a Park Slope Council seat backed by the left-leaning Working Families Party and subsequently co-founded the body's Progressive Caucus. </p><p>Four years later, Adams easily won the Brooklyn borough president race while aligned with the moderate leadership of the Brooklyn Democratic Party - including the organization's counsel, attorney Frank Carone, who would go on to become Adams' first chief of staff in City Hall.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, clashes ensued.</p><p>In 2018, Lander lambasted Adams' move to funnel $1 million in participatory budgeting money to Jesse Hamilton, a close ally to the mayor who was running against a Brooklyn progressive. (Hamilton lost, and now has a job at City Hall.)</p><p>A year later, Lander and Adams found themselves on opposite sides of a heated neighborhood spat over a popular Brooklyn brunch spot. The restaurant was run by close friends of Adams' and catered to a largely Black clientele.</p><p>Several Brooklyn electeds signed a letter calling for the restaurant's liquor license to be suspended, citing numerous complaints from neighbors about the antics of drunken patrons. Adams defended his friends - who'd hired Carone as their attorney - and called the opposition to Woodland racist. Lander, who was one of the signatories, said the restaurant owner (who is white and is also involved in the mayor's favorite Midtown haunt) was manufacturing a race issue to distract from his failure to comply with the law.</p><p>After winning the comptroller's race in 2021, Lander and Adams appeared to start off amicably, even though the two have vastly different styles and political leanings. The duo announced a joint task force before taking office focused on improved payments to nonprofits. </p><p>But things soon began to sour.</p><p>In his role as the city's chief watchdog, Lander's office scrutinizes every contract the city signs with outside vendors, employs a small army of auditors and issues reports that are then trumpeted from a prominent bully pulpit. These findings can gain significant traction in the press and therefore make the comptroller an institutional foil to City Hall - a main reason the office is used as a springboard to run for mayor.</p><p>With those tools in hand, Lander has weighed in on major issues facing the city: He released a report tracking the high vacancy rate in city government jobs along with a subsequent study that linked low staffing numbers to poor service delivery. In response, the Adams administration blamed a national labor shortage, but modified hiring parameters to attract more talent.</p><p>After Adams visited the southern border to see El Paso's response to the influx of migrants last year, Lander criticized the trip, saying it reinforced a \"harmful narrative that new immigrants themselves are a problem.\" Adams accused Lander of playing politics.</p><p>Then in early June, the comptroller questioned Adams' delayed response to a plume of Canadian forest fire smoke that briefly shrouded the city in a post-apocalyptic haze. He also traveled to Rikers Island to renew his call for a federal takeover of the local jail complex that's seen three inmate deaths this year - a change in authority the mayor vehemently opposes.</p><p>Those actions appeared to send the mayor over the edge, cementing Lander as his chief irritant.</p><p>At a June 8 press conference on the asylum-seeker crisis, Adams - unprompted - questioned whether the comptroller had adequately advocated for reimbursements from the federal government.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. What?\" the mayor said. \"Brad Lander, the loudest person in the city, has yet to go to Washington to deal with the number one issue that this city's facing. Think about that for a moment.\"</p><p>Adams then switched to a nasally voice - somewhere near Robin Williams in Mork and Mindy - that was meant to resemble Lander.</p><p>\"'I think Eric should...'\" he said, before ending the impression and repeating, \"The loudest person in the city has yet to go to Washington, D.C.\"</p><p>In a radio appearance weeks later, Lander defended his positions while insisting his critiques were part of the job description - all while retaining his buttoned-up tenor.</p><p>\"The Charter assigns the comptroller the job of oversight of the mayor and his agencies, and when you think we're not getting the competent government that we need, it's my job to be loud - that's what the job is,\" Lander told WNYC's Brian Lehrer, later adding, \"I try to keep it respectful. I would not mock or do an impression of someone else.\"</p><p>Adams' imitation is further proof of the mayor's tendency to forcefully push back on all manner of criticism directed at his administration: Within the last two months he has scolded City Council members en masse on a call and compared an 84-year-old Holocaust survivor to a plantation owner.</p><p>\"Most mayors are thin-skinned because they ... believe they are never wrong,\" former Public Advocate and mayoral candidate Mark Green said in an interview. \"But Eric is blistered by moonbeams.\"</p><p>And yet, the incoming from Lander could be worse. Much worse.</p><p>By this time in his tenure in 1995, former Comptroller Alan Hevesi was already engaging in an epic fight with former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over a potential sale of the city's water system. Hevesi then launched his bid for Gracie Mansion in 2001.</p><p>Weeks after former Comptroller John Liu took office in 2010, a contract for an automated payroll system landed on his desk. Liu, who had mayoral ambitions, rejected the troubled contract, which would balloon into a full-blown scandal for the Bloomberg administration.</p><p>And after winning office in 2013, former Comptroller Scott Stringer came out swinging. Stringer released a harsh analysis of former Mayor Bill de Blasio's free pre-kindergarten program, setting up nearly eight years of acrimony. In 2021, Stringer became one of Adams' competitors in the Democratic mayoral primary.</p><p>Now, Lander himself is signaling what a more sustained pressure campaign against Adams might look like.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the mayor's mockery, he declined to approve a contract pertaining to health benefits for unionized municipal retirees - a largely symbolic move that endeared the comptroller to the former city workers and reinforced the idea that the mayor is diminishing the quality of their health insurance. The mayor's office registered the contract anyway, calling it an improvement for retirees.</p><p>Two days later, Lander released a sharp statement criticizing the administration's implementation of a 2021 law setting a minimum wage for delivery workers for businesses like GrubHub and Seamless.</p><p>\"City Hall acquiesced to the lobbying of multi-billion dollar app companies, delaying the raises owed to deliveristas six months ago and setting a subminimum wage standard that pads corporate profits off the backs of some of the hardest workers in our city,\" he said.</p><p>Lander's office said the contract denial was a coincidence of timing and that, because he was the lead sponsor of a delivery worker pay bill while in the Council, he has consistently released strong statements about it.</p><p>Last week, however, he took a much bigger swing at the mayor.</p><p>On June 28, Lander released his first major audit of the Adams administration, which focused on the mayor's controversial initiative to clear homeless encampments in 2022.</p><p>Adams said that the idea was to connect New Yorkers living on the streets to care instead of turning a blind eye. Lander's audit found just 47 people out of 2,308 who were forcibly removed from encampments in 2022 remained in homeless shelters as of January. Only three had been placed in permanent housing.</p><p>In response to the probe, the city said the program has been successful in convincing more homeless individuals to accept help compared to prior efforts, and many encampments have not returned. At a press briefing revealing his findings, Lander said the policy did more harm than good.</p><p>\"The sweeps not only failed utterly to meet their stated goals, they also damaged the trust that outreach workers rely on to build the relationships that will actually enable them to connect people to services,\" he said.</p><p>Audits of city agencies can take a year or more to complete, meaning Lander, whose name is frequently mentioned as a future mayoral candidate, is only getting started. But increasing the intensity of his critiques could come with serious political risk.</p><p>Running for mayor is about building coalitions. And while Lander might have a natural base with the left wing of the Democratic Party - that is not necessarily enough to win.</p><p>\"Brad seems to understand politics is about addition, not subtraction,\" a former comptroller official said. \"And if you have a strong foothold with the progressives, then you need to go get some moderates.\"</p><p>Adams, for example, was elected by a strong coalition of Black and Latino voters. Lander risks alienating that crucial bloc if he puts too much pressure on the mayor, according to Basil Smikle Jr., the director of a Hunter College public policy program and former executive director of the state Democratic Party.</p><p>The risk is especially high because Adams, who is Black, can connect with his base in a way that Lander, who is white, cannot.</p><p>\"[Lander has] got to make sure to pick and choose battles carefully so he doesn't alienate these groups he might need down the road,\" Smikle said. \"And because of the added layer of race, he has got to be even more careful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00100834</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68N2-F4H1-F118-91W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1920\"/><timeReceived>6:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 7, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921130JM</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS &amp;

All firefighters are federally certified for the work, having passed a 40-hour federal wildland firefighting class and physical fitness test. Through the mutual aid agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, the requesting state or province pays all expenses of the out-of-state crews, including salary, transportation, lodging, and food.</p><p>\"There are currently 116 large fires active fires for 2.5 million acres burning nationally. Most of the activity is in the Northwest, Northern Rockies and Northern California geographic areas,\" said DCR Chief Fire Warden Dave Celino . \"We have seen unprecedented destructive fire behavior in that area of the country due to extremely dry fuel conditions, continued higher than average temperatures, very low humidity levels.\"</p><p>The Massachusetts firefighter crew being deployed includes:</p><p>State Firefighters: Roy J.

That's an entire hour with one whole story. That's Sunday night, 9:00 P.M. Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sunday morning, join me on State of the Union. I'll be talking to Republican Presidential Candidate Chris Christie and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. That's Sunday morning at 9:00 Eastern and again at noon, only here on CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our coverage continues now with one Mr. Wolf Blitzer. He's in a place I like to call THE SITUATION ROOM, right next door. I will see you Sunday morning. Until then, have a great weekend.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now, breaking news. Rudy Giuliani is ordered by a jury to pay nearly $150 million in damages to two Georgia election workers he defamed. We're breaking down the huge verdict against the former Trump lawyer tied to his lies about the 2020 presidential election. And I'll speak live with an attorney for the two election workers this hour.</p><p>Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>And we begin this hour with a major breaking story. The former Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, ordered to pay an enormous price for falsely accusing two Georgia election workers of fraud.</p><p>CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider is outside the courthouse here in Washington. Jessica, this nearly $150 million verdict is vastly more than the attorneys for the election workers even asked for.</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: It is Wolf. It's about $100 million more than their attorneys asked for, $75 million in punitive damages, essentially to punish Rudy Giuliani for those statements he made against Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, and then another $70-plus million for emotional distress and reputational damage. But even tonight, even after that massive verdict faced with paying millions of dollars, Rudy Giuliani is still not backing down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I will appeal. The absurdity of the number merely underscores the absurdity of the entire proceeding.</p><p>SCHNEIDER (voice over): Rudy Giuliani defiant after his trial to determine defamation damages. Tonight, the eight-member jury awarding the two Georgia election workers Giuliani slandered a staggering sum, nearly $150 million, between compensatory damages for both defamation and for emotional distress and punitive damages.</p><p>The verdict is meant to compensate Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, for the years of threats, harassment and fallout from Rudy Giuliani's words after the 2020 election to a Georgia State Senate committee investigating the unfounded fraud.</p><p>GIULIANI: There's a tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shaye Freeman-Moss and one other gentleman. I mean, it's obvious to anyone who's a criminal investigator or prosecutor, they are engaged in surreptitiously illegal activity, again, that day.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Both women detailed in hours of emotional testimony on the stand how these false allegations upended their lives. They received death threats.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eat (BLEEP) and die, you (BLEEP) racist. (BLEEP) and your fat (BLEEP) daughter.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Giuliani saying tonight he was not to blame for those.</p><p>GIULIANI: The comments they received, I had nothing to do with. Those comments are abominable, they're deplorable. My comments had no connection at all to those. There were thousands of things in the press about this, of which mine were a small amount.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: The plaintiffs also said they were forced into hiding and had been turned down for jobs.</p><p>SHAYE MOSS, FORMER GEORGIA ELECTION WORKER: The past few years has been devastating. The flame that Giuliani lit with those lies and passed to so many others to keep that flame blazing changed every aspect of our lives, our homes, our family, our work, our sense of safety, our mental health, and we're still working to rebuild.</p><p>RUBY FREEMAN, FORMER GEORGIA ELECTION WORKER: I can never move back into the house that I called home. I will always have to be careful about where I go and who I choose to share my name with.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: The judge had already ruled that Giuliani is liable. Their lawyers pointed to these comments from Giuliani outside court this week to prove that Giuliani still is not remorseful.</p><p>GIULIANI: They were engaged in changing votes. REPORTER: There's no proof in it.</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, you're damn right there is. Stay tuned.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: His comments years after his rampage that the 2020 election was rigged.</p><p>GIULIANI: It's enough to overturn any election. It's disgraceful what happened.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: And Giuliani refusing to back down from the lies even now.</p><p>GIULIANI: I have no doubt that my comments were made and they were supportable and are supportable today.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHNEIDER (on camera): Now, Giuliani's legal team didn't mount much of a defense, and Rudy Giuliani actually was set to testify. He promised that he would, but then at the last minute he backed down.</p><p>[18:05:02]</p><p>So, now, the big question is how or will Rudy Giuliani actually pay? Lawyers in other cases that he's been confronting have been pretty forthcoming, saying that Giuliani is so broke he can't even pay his legal bills.</p><p>So, now, Wolf, the focus will really shift to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss trying to figure out and work with their attorneys on how they'll actually get Rudy Giuliani to pay this $148 million verdict. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: All right Jessica, thank you very much, Jessica Schneider reporting for us.</p><p>I want to dig deeper right now and we got our experts to discuss. Joey Jackson, I'll start with you. What message does today's verdict actually send?</p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: That lies are unacceptable, that they have consequences, that they alter, affect and impair people's lives. To hear Mr. Giuliani talk about absurdity, I think the jury, in speaking with their verdict, said that what was absurd was his conduct, where the statements that he made.</p><p>To hear him further speak about him having nothing to do with the vile things that were said, I mean, that's comparable to lighting a match starting a forest fire and saying, I just lit the match, the forest burned on its own.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, is that in this day and age, where people are so free to speak and say whatever they think they want to say, they need to know that things like this are not protected, that jury spoke loudly and clearly, Wolf, and I think they got it right today.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. Maggie Haberman, what do you make of Giuliani's facing this resounding punishment, yes still being defiant, still repeating his baseless lies?</p><p>MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that he is very much echoing his former client, Wolf, and he has -- and he always had a piece of this in him when he was mayor and when I was covering him in his second term. He would never admit that he was wrong about something, he would never back down.</p><p>And so I'm not surprised that this is what he is doing, but he is facing very real-world circumstances here and very real-world consequences of what he has said, and he has a long habit of targeting people and attacking them and making comments that other people seized on. This is something fundamentally different. And the world got to hear, the jury got to hear these women talk about having their lives ruined.</p><p>And he is you know acting somewhat remorseful that they faced attacks that they did, but distancing himself from them and I just don't see how that's going to be a sustainable stance, but he's going to try it for a while.</p><p>BLITZER: It certainly will.</p><p>Andrew Kirtzman, you wrote an important biography on Giuliani and it's been a years-long stunning fall from grace for the man who was once called America's mayor. We all remember that. What's going through your mind right now?</p><p>ANDREW KIRTZMAN, AUTHOR, GIULIANI, THE RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF AMERICA'S MAYOR: Well, it's an epic disaster for a man whose life has been marked by epic disasters and also epic victories. I mean, this is a man who, at one point in his career, was judged more popular than the Pope, according to a poll of the public.</p><p>He -- I was with him on 9/11, you know, we all know what happened after that. And one of the things that happened is he became staggeringly wealthy. I mean, Giuliani has had one of the most stunning rise and falls of any figure in our history. But he has fallen so low, so low that right now he is near bankrupt, he is facing jail, right? He's been sued in ten civil suits. He's basically more or less been disbarred in two states. He's the subject of a sexual harassment suit. So, this is not even bottom for Giuliani. But what a stunning, stunning fall this is for him.</p><p>BLITZER: I want to bring in Karen Friedman Agnifilo, our legal analyst. Giuliani, Karen, as you know, said he had no connection to the avalanche of threats that Shaye Moss and Ruby Friedman actually faced. But let's remember some of the racist, hateful lies he told. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: How can they say there's no fraud? Look at that woman. Look at her taking those ballots out. Look at them scurrying around with the ballots, nobody in the room hiding around. They look like this. They look like they're passing out dope, not just ballots. It is quite clear they're stealing votes. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: So, given the volume of evidence against Giuliani right now, how do you think he will attempt his appeal to go forward? He says he wants his lawyers to appeal this case.</p><p>KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, let's remember, in order to appeal this case, because it's civil, he will have to put a substantial sum of money into a bond. And so -- which means he has to put that money in the bank, and that will have to be held in order for him to even get to an appeal. And, usually, it's the amount of the verdict, sometimes more. So, I don't know how he's going to do that if, at the same time, he thinks he's broke.</p><p>And I also don't think he has a viable appeal here. I mean, this was a stunning rebuke by eight United States citizens, not anybody who's in politics, not any partisan person who absolutely heard the evidence and had not only rejected it, but decided to punish him significantly for it.</p><p>[18:10:09]</p><p>So, I don't see a way out of this for him.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, Important point. Joey, I want you and our viewers to listen once again to Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman speaking after the verdict today. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOSS: Our greatest wish is that no one, no election worker or voter or school board member or anyone else ever experiences anything like what we went through.</p><p>FREEMAN: Today is not the end of the road. We still have work to do. Rudy Giuliani was not the only one who spread lies about us, and others must be held accountable, too.</p><p>I will always have to be careful about where I go and who I choose to share my name with. I miss my home, I miss my neighbors and I miss my name.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: So, Joey, what does the road ahead look like for these two women to actually receive the money they've been awarded?</p><p>JACKSON: So, Wolf, that may be challenging given the financial circumstances of Mr. Giuliani, but it is a complete vindication of know. When you have people who sometimes, and many times think, that there's a system of justice that doesn't work, it can't work, but then you have a message that that system sends, that certain conduct is unacceptable, it's empowering, and it does show what courts mean and what courts can do.</p><p>And so, yes, while there could be an issue with respect to the collection because of the amount of the verdict and the resources of the individual who has to pay it, at the end of the day, there are many mechanisms in place where maybe you don't get all, maybe you don't get even the vast majority, but I think they will get significant payment based upon the resources he does have. And at the end of the day, what they do get is what they spoke to is a measure of their reputation back that was taken from them.</p><p>BLITZER: And that is so, so important.</p><p>All right, everybody, stand by. There's a lot more we need to discuss about this truly staggering verdict, what it means for Rudy Giuliani and possibly, possibly looking forward for Donald Trump.</p><p>Our breaking news coverage will continue right after this quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:15:00]</p><p>BLITZER: We're following the breaking news, a bombshell verdict against Rudy Giuliani. A jury ordering the former Trump lawyer to pay a whopping amount, nearly $150 million, to two Georgia election workers he clearly defamed.</p><p>And, Joey, let me get back to you. Let's remember the human impact of this case. Shaye Moss testified, she was actually scared her son would find her hanging from a tree with a noose. People showed up to Ruby Freeman's house. Listen to some of the threatening voicemails these women received. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Eat (BLEEP) and die, you (BLEEP) racist, you are (BLEEP) done you (BLEEP).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to burn your store down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have a nice life, what's left of it you have.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're all going to (BLEEP) jail, you piece of (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: So, Joey, how much do you think those voicemails actually played into the jury's verdict?</p><p>JACKSON: Yes, Wolf, it was quite significant, there's no question about. You know, when people have platforms, and those platforms can really get into people's living rooms, they get into their heads and they get into their modus operandi and what potentially they can do, what they believe and the perspective that they really have and they harbor. And so you could see, based upon the anger laced those voicemail messages, what was done.</p><p>This is the consequence of indicating things to people that are lies. This is the consequence of what can happen when you spread falsehoods that injure people's reputations, that damage people emotionally and that have factors and facts that can actually harm people.</p><p>And so I think by the verdict, the jury was saying that this is unacceptable in this climate, in any climate. We all, Wolf, may have opinions, we have made thoughts, we may have beliefs, but to do what he did, Mr. Giuliani and this platform, knowing it was not true, just remarkably unacceptable. And I think that's what the jury said today.</p><p>BLITZER: And a bigger picture, Maggie, how does today's case fit into the broader problem of disinformation and election lies coming from so many within the Republican Party?</p><p>HABERMAN: Well, look, Wolf, I think we're going to see what kind of a long-term impact it has. But if you look at this as somewhat analogous to something we have seen over the course of the past year, as former President Trump has been indicted four times on two of those occasions, he's very explicitly asked for people to come protest, specifically, really in Manhattan when he was indicted the first time. And there was a lot of concern that there would be a replay of what we saw on January 6, 2021, in terms of violence.</p><p>That didn't happen because there have been so many arrests of people who invaded the Capitol, who attacked the Capitol, who rioted at the Capitol, and who were disruptive to an official proceeding. And a lot of people saw that as a deterrent from future behavior. So, this does raise the question of will this be something of a deterrent from people spreading disinformation, spreading lies about people?</p><p>These were not public figures. These were two women who got targeted and had their lives completely turned upside down. So, that is where the monetary figure really does matter.</p><p>BLITZER: It certainly does. Karen, I want you to listen to Giuliani's reaction today outside the courtroom. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: I have no doubt that my comments were made and they were supportable and are supportable today. I just did not have an opportunity to present the evidence that we offered.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: We should note, Karen, that Giuliani, as you remember, and I remember, he was once the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. He clearly knows the contours of the law. Can you fact check his arguments outside the courtroom today?</p><p>AGNIFILO: Yes. Look, as you said, he was a very well-respected lawyer. Arguably, not only was he the U.S. attorney, he was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, which many would say the most prestigious law job in the country, okay?</p><p>[18:20:02]</p><p>So, he knows the law.</p><p>But even if you don't know the law, the judge gave him an opportunity to testify. He even promised that he was going to testify and present evidence. He chose not to. That was his choice.</p><p>BLITZER: And, Andrew, Giuliani is also facing, as we all know, a separate criminal case in Georgia right now. How do you expect Giuliani will grapple with his increasing legal and indeed financial peril?</p><p>KIRTZMAN: Well, I mean, Giuliani always believes he's right. I don't think he's going to kind of throw himself on the mercy of the court any more than he did in this trial. I mean, this is all kind of very much a piece of the Giuliani playbook. He causes these like huge calamities around him, and he's standing in the middle claiming he was right about everything. And I think that's going to happen going forward.</p><p>I mean, this is a man who has this sense of moral certitude that he's right, everyone else is wrong, and he's kind of the same morality cop that he was when he was a prosecutor, as you said, back in the 1980s. The problem is that now he's nearing 80 years old, he's going to be penniless very soon, he could end up in jail.</p><p>And the story of Rudy Giuliani, in hindsight, is going to include the fact that he caused two impeachments, got handed a verdict of $150 million for defaming people and could end up in prison. It's quite a trajectory.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, quite a fall for the man once known as America's mayor.</p><p>All right, guys, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Coming up, I'll speak with a lawyer for the two George election workers who now stand to gain millions, millions of dollars for the lies Rudy Giuliani told about them.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:25:00]</p><p>BLITZER: We're back with the breaking news. Rudy Giuliani is vowing to appeal a staggering verdict against him. A jury ordering the former Trump lawyer to pay nearly $150 million for defaming two Georgia election workers he falsely accused of committing fraud.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: I certainly will appeal. The absurdity of the number merely underscores the absurdity of the entire proceeding.</p><p>REPORTER: Do you have any regrets about some of the comments that the women received?</p><p>GIULIANI: Well, of course, the comments they received, I had nothing to do with. Those comments are abominable, they're deplorable, no defense to it, but I receive comments like that every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: And now former election workers Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman also spoke out after the verdict was announced here in Washington just a little while ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOSS: The flame that Giuliani lit with those lies and passed to so many others to keep that flame blazing changed every aspect of our lives, our homes, our family, our work, our sense of safety, our mental health.</p><p>FREEMAN: I want people to understand this money will never solve all of my problems. I can never move back into the house that I called home. I will always have to be careful about where I go and who I choose to share my name with.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: And joining me now here in THE SITUATION ROOM is Rachel Goodman. She's one of the attorneys who represented Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in their defamation case against Rudy Giuliani. Rachel, thanks very much for coming in.</p><p>I know you're happy about this verdict. How are your clients feeling right now about this truly staggering $148 million verdict against Giuliani for defaming them?</p><p>RACHEL GOODMAN, COUNSEL, PROTECT DEMOCRACY: As Lady Ruby would put it, it's a good day. Wolf, it's one step on a long journey for them toward accountability and toward trying to rebuild their lives, but today was a good day for them.</p><p>BLITZER: What do you make of Giuliani sticking by his awful lies and his comments about your two clients?</p><p>GOODMAN: For me, it really highlights the importance of this kind of accountability. We're quite hopeful that this verdict will make a difference there, and we're going to continue to pursue that verdict.</p><p>BLITZER: You know what surprised me, the verdict actually was, what, about $100 million more than your clients had originally asked for, right?</p><p>GOODMAN: The total was $148 million and across the three categories of damages, some of which we had put numbers on for the jury and some of which we sort of leave the jury to come up with numbers on their own, and I think they were moved by the client's testimony. BLITZER: Did it surprise you that, at the last minute, after repeated insistence that he would testify, he decided not to show up and testify?</p><p>GOODMAN: Yes and no. I think Mr. Giuliani and his colleagues are fond of saying they're about to produce the evidence, Wolf. And when push comes to shove, of course, they don't have any evidence. And so his declining to testify, I felt, in a pattern with that.</p><p>BLITZER: We all know he's got some significant financial problems of his own right now. He doesn't have $140 million, by all accounts. Do you expect your clients to actually get significant sums of money from him?</p><p>GOODMAN: Well, we are going to pursue the verdict and do everything we can to make sure they get as much of it as possible. So, we'll see. Although, of course, nothing can make them whole, and they would trade all of it to get back to their lives before all of this started.</p><p>BLITZER: Because they were receiving, your two clients, their lives were basically overturned as a result of the lies that he was delivering.</p><p>[18:30:07]</p><p>But others were making similar lies against these two women as well. And they said they want to go forward and perhaps launch cases against them, maybe including Trump himself. Is that what you're thinking of doing?</p><p>GOODMAN: Well, Trump was a co-conspirator in this case, as the court held. So, this verdict is also a forum of vulnerability there. And I want to make clear they are continuing. Their lives haven't sort of gone back to normal and the threats haven't ended. They're still dealing with that today. And so we're going to do everything we can to make them whole, however we can.</p><p>BLITZER: But Trump is not financially liable right now, is he?</p><p>GOODMAN: This verdict is against Giuliani.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, just Giuliani, okay.</p><p>Rachel Goodman, congratulate your two clients for us. Thank you very much.</p><p>GOODMAN: Pass it on. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BLITZER: Thank you very much.</p><p>Still ahead, another breaking story we're following right now, Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by IDF forces in Gaza. I'll get reaction from key White House Official John Kirby.</p><p>And a CNN exclusive, highly classified U.S. intelligence on Russian interference in the 2016 election mysteriously vanished during the final days of Donald Trump's presidency.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:35:00]</p><p>BLITZER: In Israel tonight, protests in Tel Aviv after the Israeli military revealed its forces mistakenly shot and killed three hostages held in Gaza.</p><p>CNN's Alex Marquardt is joining us live from Tel Aviv right now. Alex, tell us more about the death of these hostages and how Israelis are reacting.</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, this is a deeply painful moment for this country. And as soon as this news came of these three deaths, a call was put out for a protest here in Tel Aviv that has just ended in the past few moments. For the past three hours, hundreds and hundreds of people have been snaking their way through the streets of Tel Aviv, starting at the defense ministry, essentially Tel Aviv's Pentagon.</p><p>And what we learned from the IDF earlier today was that three hostages, three young men who have been kidnapped on October 7th were killed in Northeastern Gaza, in the area called Shejaiya, where the IDF has been fighting against Hamas militants. Their names are Yotam Haim, Alon Shimriz and Samir Talalka. All of them, I believe, in their 20s. The IDF called this a sad and painful incident.</p><p>What happened is these men were near a group of IDF soldiers who saw them, who thought that they were militants, who thought they might have been terrorists. They were fired upon. The soldiers then went over. They saw the bodies. They grew suspicious. They then confirmed in Israel that these were the bodies of hostages.</p><p>Wolf, there's an investigation underway. There are all kinds of questions. Did the men have their hands up? Were they speaking in Hebrew? The IDF did speculate that perhaps they had been released or escaped from captivity, that maybe the militants had left them behind because they had been pushed out.</p><p>But in either case, it is obviously a profound tragedy that they were on the cusp of getting rescued after more than two months in captivity, and instead they were shot and killed. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: How much more pressure, Alex, does this put on Prime Minister Netanyahu right now?</p><p>MARQUARDT: I think a significant amount. There already was a lot of pressure from these families, from everyone in Israel who wants to see these people come home. And this tragedy will ratchet that up even more.</p><p>The people I've been speaking to tonight have essentially been saying we don't want a ceasefire. We don't necessarily want the war in Gaza to end. The IDF can keep going after Hamas, but what is needed now is a new deal. A deal needs to be struck. Maybe there needs to be a pause, some kind of exchange with Hamas.</p><p>I spoke with a former general, Noam Tibon, who told me, whatever it takes to bring them home. I said, even if it's the worst Hamas prisoners in Israeli prisons, he said, whatever it takes, this country needs to bring these people home.</p><p>But for the time being, Wolf, our understanding is that these talks over the hostages are at a standstill. I reported a couple of days ago that Israel actually canceled a trip by its main negotiator to go back to Qatar to keep negotiating. Prime Minister Netanyahu has called this a priority. The people I met tonight want it to be the priority. Wolf?</p><p>BLITZER: Let's hope they come home soon, as we keep saying. Alex Marquardt in Tel Aviv, thank you very, very much.</p><p>I'm joined now by John Kirby. He's the National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications over at the White House. John, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>I want to get to the IDF mistakenly killing three Israeli hostages. Can Israel be relied on to protect hostages during its full scale assault on Gaza, based on what has just been reported?</p><p>JOHN KIRBY, COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: We should be careful of drawing too many firm conclusions here about what tragically happened today, which the Israelis, of course, acknowledged right away that they were responsible for this. It's tragic, heartbreaking news for now, three families that are just going to be getting the worst, worst possible news that any family can get. And we grieve with them, we mourn with them, we'll pray for them.</p><p>And I'm sure that the Israelis will do the forensics on this. They'll work through how this happened and how to learn lessons from it so it doesn't happen again. They, too, just like us, they share a strong desire to get every single one of those hostages back home with their families safe and sound, where they belong, and we're going to continue to do what we can to help them achieve that. We still believe that it's possible to get a pause in place to get another exchange of hostages, and we're working on that by the hour.</p><p>BLITZER: I'm glad to hear that. What is your message, John, to the families of the American hostages still being held in Gaza, who may be understandably even more fearful right now?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, it's the same message that President Biden relayed to them when he met him right here in the White House earlier this week. We are not going to forget your loved ones. They are Americans and we want to get them home to you as quickly as possible and that we are working, as I said to you before, by the hour.</p><p>[18:40:02]</p><p>The other thing he promised them was that he would keep them informed, and we have, and we'll continue to do so, as we learn more.</p><p>They have been a terrific source, not just of inspiration for us, but also information, helping us glean a little bit more about their loved ones, because it's hard to get perfect data on exactly where they are, what their condition is, where they're being kept and with whom they're being kept and who has them, quite frankly. And we're working really hard to get our arms around that. We want to get them all home just as soon as possible. BLITZER: The three hostages who were killed were in an active combat zone in Northern Gaza. How does this fit into the U.S. understanding of where the hostages are being held?</p><p>KIRBY: Again, difficult to make any firm, broad conclusions based on this one event, but it is certainly not contrary to our concerns that Hamas is probably holding them in various groups, not all together, certainly putting them in harm's way, willingly putting them in harm's way, and potentially in crossfire. Again, without speaking to the specifics of this event, Hamas absolutely wants to hide behind innocent humans, including hostages.</p><p>So, it's just a reminder. It underscores the very difficult challenge that the Israeli Defense Forces have before them as they go after these leaders of Hamas. It's not like they can separate the battlefield innocence to terrorists. It's all commingled because Hamas wants it to be commingled, because they want to make it more difficult for the Israelis to go after that leadership network.</p><p>So, again, it's a terrible, terrible day, but it is a reminder of just how much more difficult this fight is for Israeli Defense Forces.</p><p>BLITZER: And as you know, John, this comes as a strike in southern Gaza, killed children sheltering at a school and an Al Jazeera cameraman. When you see strikes like these, can you really say Israel is listening to the U.S. urging everyone to protect civilians?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, without speaking to the specifics of this particular strike, and, again, our deepest condolences go out to Al Jazeera Network and to everyone associated with that journalist doing his job, just out there doing his job, reporting on a conflict as well as any other innocence that could have been killed or wounded in this attack.</p><p>We have communicated to the Israelis, and Jake Sullivan is just wrapping up a trip to Israel and the West bank today, matter of fact, and conveyed this message, as the president has. We want them to be as careful and deliberate as possible and to take additional steps to reduce harm to civilians.</p><p>They have been receptive to that message. They have made some changes in the way they have approached tactical operations. That doesn't mean that more can't be done. Certainly more can be done to protect innocent life. And we're going to continue to urge and work with our Israeli counterparts to that end.</p><p>BLITZER: John Kirby, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KIRBY: Yes, sir.</p><p>BLITZER: And now we have exclusive new CNN reporting on the mysterious disappearance of highly classified U. S. intelligence on Russia. The information was brought in a binder to the White House in the final days of the Trump administration, and then it vanished.</p><p>CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is here. He's got details for us. Evan, how sensitive was the intelligence in this binder and how did it go missing?</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRSEPONDENT: Well, this is a very sensitive piece of intelligence. This is some of the raw intelligence that really underpinned the finding by the intelligence community that Vladimir Putin wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 election. And it is something that Donald Trump and some of his allies were absolutely obsessed with. They wanted to try to get some of this information out because he believed, Donald Trump believed that the Russia investigation was a hoax, and he believed putting that information out would help prove his case.</p><p>One of the problems was, Wolf, that some of this intelligence was so sensitive that it threatened to expose the sources and methods, the ways that the U.S. intelligence community and some of the NATO allies collected some of its most sensitive information on Russia. And so that's one reason why there was so much pushback on trying to get some of this information out.</p><p>Now, we know that the last time some of this information, this binder of documents was found -- was seen, rather, was in the closing days of the White House, where Donald Trump had asked for this information to be brought in so that he could declassify it. And we know that, in the end, the former president did actually sign a declassification order. It was never actually released publicly. And so that's one reason why there's a mystery as to what happened to this binder.</p><p>We know there is one theory that Cassidy Hutchinson, who worked with Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff, she had a theory on where some of this might have gone. Listen.</p><p>CASSIDY HUTCHINSON, FORMER AIDE TO FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF MARK MEADOWS: I watched him climb into the limo, noticing the original Crossfire Hurricane binder tucked under his arm.</p><p>[18:45:03]</p><p>I did not have time to ask what he planned to do with it as he drove away. What the hell is Mark doing with the unredacted Crossfire Hurricane binder?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>PEREZ: Wolf, that's a reference to Crossfire Hurricane, the name of the federal investigation that was looking into the efforts by Russia to try to meddle in the 2016 election.</p><p>BLITZER: Evan, how is Meadows responding?</p><p>PEREZ: Well, Mark Meadows' attorney George Terwilliger pushed back strongly against any implication from Cassidy Hutchinson, from her book there that Meadows mishandled intelligence. I will read you a part of what he said in a statement to CNN.</p><p>He said: Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material. Any such material that he handled or was in possession of had been treated accordingly. He said that any implication that Mark Meadows had anything to do with the missing binder, of course, is wrong, Wolf.</p><p>But we know that the mystery remains. We know that the -- certainly, the FBI, the intelligence community was so concerned about this that they briefed members of the intelligence committee, the senior leadership of the intelligence committee in the Senate about this very thing -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Evan Perez, thank you very much for that report.</p><p>Coming up, inside Rudy Giuliani's financial mess as he's now on the hook to pay nearly $150 million in damages for his 2020 election lies.</p><p>And the results of the autopsy on \"Friends\" star Matthew Perry have just been revealed.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:50:44]</p><p>BLITZER: More now on today's massive verdict against Rudy Giuliani. The nearly $150 million judgment is just the latest blow to the former Trump attorney's finances.</p><p>CNN's Brian Todd is taking a closer look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I know crimes. I can smell them.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The man once known as America's mayor lauded for his integrity and leadership during and after 9/11 is tonight on the losing end of a nearly $150 million judgment in the Georgia civil defamation case.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani is already out of cash and under a mountain of legal bills and sanctions.</p><p>KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: I don't think we're grasping how significant the bills are for Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>TODD: CNN's Katelyn Polantz has done extensive reporting on Giuliani's financial problems. In addition to this latest judgment, he owes more than $1 million to defense attorneys prompting them to sue them. He was behind on nearly $60,000 for unpaid phone bills.</p><p>And this summer, he traveled to Mar-a-Lago to make a personal appeal to Donald Trump to help him pay his legal bills.</p><p>POLANTZ: The amount of money it costs to fight a lawsuit let alone almost a dozen lawsuits over the last two years, couple years, is -- it is really mind-boggling, those numbers. TODD: In court, Giuliani's attorneys said he's facing 11 lawsuits and investigations. He's also been criminally indicted in Georgia related to the efforts by him, Donald Trump and others to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. He could face criminal charges in the special counsel's federal election interference case. And he's facing disbarment in New York and Washington.</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: He's attacked both in his professional arena, he's attacked in the civil court and now in the criminal court as well. And that is a -- that's a heavy load to carry.</p><p>TODD: And Giuliani has admitted he's not been carrying it, at least not financially. During this definition trial, Giuliani's lawyer called the proceedings the civil equivalent of the death penalty. They're trying to end Mr. Giuliani.</p><p>To deal with the money crunch, Giuliani is trying to sell his three- bedroom Manhattan apartment for $6.1 million and he was at one point offering to record video greetings for strangers on the website Cameo.</p><p>GIULIANI: I could do a happy birthday greeting.</p><p>JON AVLON, FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER FOR MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI: You know, he's always loved opera, but this is a tragic opera, make no mistake, and it's self-inflicted at this stage. It's heartbreaking to see.</p><p>TODD: The man who took down the New York mafia, who turned around New York City's fortunes as mayor and who did at one time hold considerable personal wealth seems to have squandered it all for one man.</p><p>AVLON: He's destroyed his reputation and his independent financial foundation, all to help Donald Trump lie about an election. He threw it all away.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (on camera): A spokesman for Giuliani declined to comment today on his current financial state. It's not clear at the moment if he'll be able to shield himself from some of the damages in this latest judgment against him by declaring bankruptcy -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Brian Todd reporting -- Brian, thank you.</p><p>And coming up, the \"Friends\" star Matthew Perry's cause of death.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[18:58:04]</p><p>BLITZER: There's more breaking news. The Los Angeles County Medical examiner concluding \"Friends\" Matthew Perry died as a result of the acute effects of ketamine and subsequent drowning.</p><p>CNN'S chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is joining us right now.</p><p>Sanjay, what do you make of this finding?</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It's a sad story, Wolf. I read through the 30-page report. Basically the headline is exactly what you said. It sounds like Matthew Perry had taken ketamine. They found trace elements of it in his stomach. So, it sounds like this was something that he swallowed, and he was in a pool.</p><p>Ketamine is a dissociative drug. It can cause people to have difficulties with breathing and stuff. But what seemed to have happened here, is that he became dissociative being in a poll, he subsequently drowned, Wolf. So, really sad.</p><p>One medical examiner that we spoke to about this specifically, just put a fine point on it. They said it's probably not the ketamine specifically that led to his death, but made it possible for him to drown, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: And we're told that --</p><p>GUPTA: So, just a sad story.</p><p>BLITZER: Yeah, very sad. We're told that Perry was taking ketamine for depression, right?</p><p>GUPTA: Yeah. Yes, he was. But I think that reading the report, this was a little bit unrelated to that. He was getting infusions of ketamine, but the last time he had received that was a week and a half earlier. To give you context, Wolf, the half life is a few hours.</p><p>So, this -- it can be a legitimate therapy for depression and anxiety, but this was not related to that. It sounds like he was taking it as well on his own, recreationally. It sounds like he swallowed pills because it was trace elements found in his stomach and that seems to have led to his becoming disassociated while he was in the pool and then sadly leading to his drowning.</p><p>BLITZER: What other -- some of the other contributing factors, what stands out to you?</p><p>GUPTA: I think those are the main things, wolf. One thing -- you know, when I first heard this and heard that the ketamine was involved, I was curious, were there other medications involved? Because typically, ketamine alone does not lead to someone dying. It's rare. It can happen and he was -- he did take fairly high doses. But even at those doses, it's unusual for that to lead to death.</p><p>So, what really stood out was the fact that he took the ketamine but that he was in a pool. Had he not been in a pool, Wolf, it's not likely he would have died.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. Sanjay, thank you very much for that report.</p><p>And to our viewers, thanks for watching. I'm Wolf Blitzer in THE SITUATION ROOM.</p><p>\"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2023121501CNV16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69WC-S161-F072-X2FY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 15, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000CUUD</classCode><className>HAMAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The \"ProtoMethee-1\" satellite is intended to be launched towards the end of 2023 in low Earth orbit (LEO). The company's service demonstrator will be based on a high revisit rate constellation (20 times more passes per day) and offering hyper-reactivity through inter-constellation connectivity.</p><p>The aim of France's Promethee, located in Paris and Toulouse, is to bring less expensive space applications to emerging countries, in particular in Latin America and Africa. The company recently raised 4.7 million euros after a first fundraising in September 2020 of 2.2 million euros achieved through business angels, financials and three companies specialised in the space industry, Hemeria, Comat and ADF.</p><p>The possible applications resulting from Promethee's satellite data and digital platform range from forest fire detection to water management, food security, urban planning, desertification control, crisis management, critical infrastructure protection and defence.</p><p>Olivier Piepsz, president of Promethee, said: \"NanoAvionics is one of the most innovative European space companies with an excellent flight heritage. Leaving the manufacturing of our first satellite as well as launch services and operations in their capable hands, Promethee will soon become France's leading NewSpace operator for Earth Observation. It is our intention to keep innovating through new space explorations and new uses, while at the same time strengthening France's resilience through space and digital sovereignty among the space fairing nations.\"</p><p>Vytenis J. Buzas, CEO NanoAvionics, said: \"The French NewSpace market, based on the country's space heritage and bold space technology development policies is one of the most active in the world. We are proud to be supplying small satellite technologies to household names, such as Thales Alenia Space, as well as partnering with promising and rising stars such as Promethee, Gama Space, and ExoTrail among others.</p><p>The recent mission contract with Promethee shows our continued fast-paced business growth and further advancement into the French market. In line with our existing engagement with French NewSpace companies, growing the business and to further improve our customer service, we will be exploring different opportunities to establish a NanoAvionics base in the country.\"</p><p>\"2022 has already been another exciting year for NanoAvionics and the remaining months are looking very promising.

Yesterday was the twenty-fifth day without rain in this county. The farmers are literally praying for rain. From all sections come the reports that pasture lands are scorching brown under the burning sun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A deputy warden at the lookout tower near Foxville is watching day and night to protect anything like a forest fire at this time. From the top of towers strategically located near timberland communities of the state, men are straining their eyes to discover the least vestige of fire. All the fire towers are in telephonic communication, so that it is possible to summon additional forces to danger points in a minimum of time.</p><p>How the outbreak of anthrax, which was found on the farm of A.A. Boyer, near Jefferson, had its origin here is not known. Those who have charge of the fight against the disease say they haven't an idea from what source it originated in this county. Anthrax is one of the oldest diseases known. For years, there was no way of controlling it, but later a vaccine was discovered that did not cure but prevented a spread of the disease. Sheep, cattle, hogs, horses and man are most susceptible to the disease, it is said. In order to keep the disease from spreading in this county, Dr. R.V. Smith, veterinarian, and Dr. R.C. Reed, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the State Board of Agriculture, are inoculating herds adjoining the Boyer farm.</p><p>40 Years Ago</p><p>Oct. 7, 1982</p><p>Frederick City officials will again ask the county commissioners to sell the old county courthouse to use as a city hall after the upcoming county election, Mayor Ronald N. Young said at his weekly press conference Wednesday. The city has investigated expansion of the present city hall, which officials say is too small for their needs. If, after the election, the next board of county commissioners is not interested in selling the building, the city will continue to develop prospects for city hall expansion, Young said.</p><p>William Rice is not one to gloat over attaining personal goals, but lately he has been smiling about a major improvement in Thurmont's wastewater treatment plant. Rice, Thurmont's town superintendent, has been the guiding force behind the project, which will cost $3.7 million. \"It has been in the planning stages for six years,\" Rice said. \"It's now in the building stage ... at last. It has been a long time. Dealing with the EPA, the state Department of Natural Resources, federal and county agencies has been hectic.\"</p><p>(Editor's Note: The News-Post does not have access to archives from 50 years ago for August 1972 through March 1973.

The ceremony marked the end of an era for a class of ships that dominated the United States' World War II efforts. Tank-landing ships (LSTs) such as the Frederick were first used to transport tanks and troops in World War II and were the most abundant vessel in the war. Although Frederick will no longer serve the Navy, the ship is slated to continue service in the Mexican navy.</p><p>A Frederick boy was mugged and robbed of cash early Friday evening on West Patrick Street, according to Frederick police. The boy reported at 6:30 p.m. Friday that he had been assaulted and robbed by other youths in the area, police said. Officers rounded up several suspects, and the boy positively identified those who had assaulted him, according to police. Three Frederick juveniles were arrested and charged with robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, second-degree assault, conspiracy to commit second-degree assault, malicious destruction of property and theft under $500, according to police. Charges are pending against three other suspects who were identified as a result of the investigation.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)

You could be gifting a forest fire, bird flu outbreak or childhood trauma. Every animal gift contributes to the methane emergency which is accelerating global temperature rises.

Now          HE'S BACK          with          REBEL MOON-PART ONE: A CHILD OF FIRE          on Netflix. This time          SUCCESS OR FAILURE          will be          ON HIS OWN TERMS         -the way he likes it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BY MICKEY RAPKIN          PHOTOGRAPHS BY ERIC RAY DAVIDSON       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">         FANBOYS, REDDIT TROLLS, GRETA GERWIG-         They all seem to have an opinion of Zack Snyder and his work, which most people have decided are the same thing. \"Love him or hate him,\" Snyder says of his outsized reputation. \"A lot of intellectuals-I don't know what you would call it, the cinephile-elite-genre-press people-are kind of anti-me for whatever reason.\" He proceeds to quote an article that said: \"Zack Snyder probably masturbates every time he says cut.\"       </p><p>         Here the person responsible for more than $4 billion in box-office receipts screws his face up. \"I was just like, Really? You think that's a cool thing to say?          Because you have this perception of me as some sort of supermacho-I don't think I'm a macho dude. I'm interested in masculine tropes. But as          tropes.\"       </p><p>         Man, those tropes will trip you up. Perhaps it was the hypermasculine tone of his breakout film,          300,                     a sword-and-sandal epic from 2007 that introduced audiences to both Snyder's graphic, slo-mo violence and Gerard Butler's cobblestone abs. But the worst you can say about that movie (which spawned a popular Spartan workout) is that it was a perfectly mindless thrill-like            Gladiator            for people who can't read good. Which is precisely the kind of snarky commentary Snyder would hate.                </p><p>         Nothing crystallized his divisive public image more than the relentless social-media campaign run by fans demanding: \"#ReleaseTheSnyderCut.\" For about a                     decade, Snyder had been the architect of the DC cinematic universe. He directed two stand-alone Superman films, hand-picked Gal Gadot to play Wonder Woman, and was generally charged with maintaining a singular vision for this beloved IP. But his 2017 cut of            Justice League            left Warner Bros. executives wanting, and after weathering a devastating personal tragedy, Snyder left the project entirely.                </p><p>         Justice League          went through extensive reshoots by another filmmaker. And when that Frankensteined film disappointed critics and accountants, Snyder's          Justice League          took on mythic proportions. Fanboys          rented a billboard in Times Square at an estimated cost of $50,000 a day that said #ReleaseTheSnyderCut. More troubling were the tweets; as the Snyder Cut became the white whale for an army of trolls, the worst among them started threatening the lives of studio executives at Warner Bros. The security division had to get involved.       </p><p>         The conversation around Snyder hit a fever pitch this past summer with a punchline in (of all places)          Barbie.          The moment arrives relatively late in the story, though it hits precisely at the film's emotional climax. Ryan Gosling's Ken has brought the patriarchy to Barbieland, brainwashing women into submission. But as the Barbies wake up-thanks to a powerful feminist battle cry delivered by America Ferrera-one of the dolls mutters: \"It's like I've been in a dream where I was really invested in the Zack Snyder Cut of          Justice League.\"       </p><p>         Say what you will about the joke (and people have said a lot), but can you imagine making billions of dollars in profit for          a studio only to have it turn around and make you the butt of a joke in its biggest summer blockbuster of all time?       </p><p>         Holy whiplash, Batman!       </p><p>         \"THEY GAVE                                US            a heads-up,\" Snyder reveals here for the first time. Warner Bros.' new CEO, Michael DeLuca, was talking to Snyder's wife and producing partner, Deborah Snyder, earlier this year. \"And he said, 'Hey, there's a reference to            Justice            League            in the movie. It's cool and whatever, I hope you guys understand, we think it's awesome.' \"                </p><p>         This was hardly the first joke at Snyder's expense. (He'd already been pilloried on          The Simpsons-         \"Un-release          the Snyder Cut\"-and on Amazon's          The Boys.)          But it was certainly the most visible. The Barbie movie has already made more than $1 billion in global box office. To his credit, Snyder didn't run from the moment. He had a barbecue, inviting a bunch of friends over to watch          Barbie          in his private screening room, where plush alpaca blankets from Restoration Hardware warm every one of the 16 recliners, and they all shared a good laugh at their host's expense.       </p><p>                    \"I thought [           Barbie           ] was great,\" Snyder says with boyish enthusiasm, \"and I think the joke is pretty good,\" saying it's more a crack about the fandom than it is about him. \"A hundred percent,\" he says. But on the eve of arguably his most ambitious project yet, a two-part space opera for Netflix called                   Rebel Moon,          he admits the joke also left him slack-jawed.       </p><p>         \"The thing that I said to Debbie is-the thing that you need to take a second and think about is that your name is so seamlessly sewed together with a pop-culture phenomenon so big it can exist as a joke in a movie about Barbie. That's pretty insane. You just need to step back for a second and go like, 'Whoa, what did we do? What happened? How is that a thing?' \"       </p><p>         That Snyder would become the town's poster child for red-pill bros wasn't his plan. And he's quick to say he can't control his fans and wouldn't dare try. \"I don't feel like I'm the moral police of the Internet. It's a pretty righteous move to assume that my morality is somehow above the morality of these people that I don't know.\" (His wife argues the toxic fans are a tiny subset of what is an otherwise supportive community.) Does Snyder feel misunderstood? \"Sometimes I do,\" he says. Or, put another way, he offers: \"So you're like, 'Oh, Snyder's a fucking male, toxic masculine fuck.' I have fucking nail polish on my fucking thumbs, for God's sake.\"       </p><p>         Snyder was born in Wisconsin, and the family later moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts. His father was an academic, but his mother was perhaps the real influence. An eccentric artist, she made ice sculptures on the front lawn and pulled her son out of school to see          Star Wars.          On New Year's Eve, she once decided to celebrate by painting a mural on a wall of the family home. \"She was always creating,\" Debbie says.       </p><p>         He studied fine-art painting in London before enrolling at Pasadena's ArtCenter College of Design. He has an artist's eye for detail-an aesthetic-takes-all philoso         hy of design down to his own body. (The 57-year-old's perfectly worn-in T-shirt betrays a ripped, sinewy physique.) We're seated in his office-a glass box jutting out from a Pasadena hillside, which he knowingly likens to the \"lair of a supervillain.\" But the joint is warmer than that-lived-in, filled with mementos and inspiration from his formative years. First-edition comic books (including          Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)          line the bookshelves; a Helmut Newton print hangs on the wall.       </p><p>         Snyder has seven kids (from different marriages and relationships), and his family lives just up the street from the office. His personal gym, mostly outfitted by Arsenal Strength, is on the property. (\"I just always find the gym is a great place to kind of let everything go,\" he says.) He's also installed a pottery studio here inside a shipping container, where he's been working on crafting the perfect coffee mug. Elsewhere, a 1966 Land Rover is parked in the driveway-minus the hard-shell top he recently had torn off. Of the truck, he says, \"It's like everything. It's just a project. I like projects, obviously.\"       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"dbbf806bcf824a4cb8f167affcddad66\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>Zack Snyder at home in Pasadena, at the wheel of his 1966 Land Rover. </p><p>         Nothing in Snyder's life is ever really finished, least of all his films. \"My editor, she always says the movie's never finished. They just end. Because they have to be released.\" He's not exaggerating. Snyder's done extended versions-the mythic director's cuts-of nearly every one of his films, dating back to the first, 2004's          Dawn of the Dead.          His latest,          Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire,                     a Kurosawa-meets-           Jedi            PG-13 flick on Netflix in December, is the rare unreleased film that will be followed with an alternate R-rated director's cut.                </p><p>         Rebel Moon          concerns Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former member of the dark Imperium who seeks redemption by recruiting a ragtag group of warriors to take on the fascist regime. If it sounds like the setup to a          Star Wars          movie, well, the project began as a Lucasfilm pitch. The Jedi overlords passed on it, which didn't shock Snyder: \"They had their own ideas about what they wanted their          Star Wars          universe to be. That's fair.\" He later took          Rebel Moon          out as a potential TV series (\"I've had bad luck in pitching TV shows for whatever reason\") and then a video game before Netflix bit.       </p><p>Snyder calls the idea \"relentless,\" likening moviemaking to excavating a mineshaft. \"You crack open the earth and you start digging,\" he says. \"And I think that this movie, I was mining the stuff that I really love. It's a love letter to the movies that made me love movies.\"          Star Wars,          Terrence Malick's          Days of Heaven          (whose sweeping Texas landscapes are reimagined here), Kurosawa's          Seven Samurai-it's          all on display, along with a healthy dose of fantasy courtesy of          Heavy Metal,          a vintage magazine his mother mistakenly gifted to him when he was 12, not realizing \"it was very European-it's like sex and violence.\"       </p><p>         That's certainly enough to launch a space epic. (A sequel,          Rebel Moon-Part Two: The Scargiver,          is due out next year.) But these are more than childhood obsessions. In a way, they're breadcrumbs to Snyder's psyche. Or perhaps they're scars. When Snyder was 13, he tells me, his older brother Sam was killed in a car accident. Here he stands up and moves to the bookcase to retrieve a small framed photograph of his brother, like a school portrait in a series cut impossibly short. His brother is 19 and he has long hair. He looks like Jesus.       </p><p>         Sam's death, he says, \"sent me deeper into my love for movies-as an escape, as a way to deal with it. I needed some metaphors to help me. In the mythology of our family, he was the spiritual leader. When you're 19 and you pass from the world, you leave a mark on it. You are immortal in that state-that youthful, magical person is locked in.\" A picture comes into focus of a kid whose hero was taken away from him. Around that time, Zack read Arnold Schwarzenegger's first book on bodybuilding and started to work out himself-maybe as a way to exert          some control          on an out-of-control          world.                   His lionizing of the male          physique-on          display                   in          all of his films, including            Rebel                            Moon-         comes           into focus. His          Superman          was never going to be a slight Christopher Reeve. It had to be a yoked He-Man.       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4ed9ae718e184a198555d61d712715e5\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>SNYDER HAS EXPERIENCED          more than his fair share of loss, as if loss is ever fair. I'd argue          Barbie         's Snyder Cut joke works better if you're not familiar with what         was happening in Snyder's personal life around the time the          Justice League          mess began. While he was deep at work on          Justice League,          Snyder's 20-year-old daughter, Autumn, took her own life. Autumn (from his first marriage, to Denise Snyder) was a student at Sarah Lawrence College at the time, and she'd recently written a sci-fi fantasy novel about an outsider struggling to fit in.       </p><p>         Snyder had never intended to make her death public. He and Debbie tried to power through the production, but he quickly realized the thing to do was to go home. \"I was at a place after Autumn and after          Justice League          where I just kind of felt like there needed to be a reassessment of the why of everything,\" he tells me.          Justice League          would be reshot by          The Avengers'          Joss Whedon, who amped up the comedy and cut back on Ray Fisher's turn as Cyborg-a move Fisher alleged was racially motivated.       </p><p>         The dark tone on display in Snyder's DC films was MIA. And the fans went full tilt demanding the studio \"#ReleaseTheSnyderCut.\" Snyder declined to intervene, insisting today that it wasn't his place to ask his fans to stand down. \"I felt like my relationship with the fans is really one-way,\" he says. \"I give, I deliver, and I share with them ideas that I have. I am 100 percent against anyone threatening and doing anything to bully. That's not cool, but that's also obvious.\"       </p><p>         Again, what else could he say? It's hard to kneecap your fans when they're responsible for giving you maybe the most unlikely second chance in Hollywood history. They're responsible for the world seeing the film that Snyder always wanted to make. In the run-up to the launch of HBO Max, the studio finally engaged with the fans, imagining the Snyder Cut as the kind of must-subscribe event that would get people to pay ten dollars a month (or whatever) for yet another streaming service. The studio eventually gave Snyder about $70 million to finish the movie his way, which required shooting additional scenes during a pandemic lockdown, reportedly violating safety protocols (which Snyder denied).       </p><p>         When the long-awaited Snyder Cut came to HBO Max in 2021, it was more than four hours long. Among the scenes the director added was an epilogue between Ben Affleck's Batman and Jared Leto's Joker in which Batman threatens to kill his archnemesis, prompting the Joker to crack: \"Who's gonna give you a reach-around?\" It was an ad-lib on Leto's part (and true to that actor's camp take on the role). But Snyder went with it: If this was his last chance to direct a DC film, as a fan he needed Batman and the Joker to meet. The Snyder Cut also restored Cyborg's journey (reminding audiences how good Ray Fisher could be). And perhaps most important, a billboard for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention was inserted into the film with the message \"You are not alone.\"       </p><p>         Says Snyder: \"Regardless of how you feel about the movie, whether it's good or bad or whatever, just existing as it does at that level-at that price point with those characters-it literally should not exist. And I am incredibly grateful for the fans and for the circumstances that led to it, because it really is a personal, cathartic piece, working out a lot of demons in a giant 1.43:1,\" referring to the IMAX-friendly proportions.       </p><p>         \"I hate the circumstances,\" Snyder adds. \"But this is true of all things in your life. A lot of times you find a turning point that is not the way you'd want it.\" He goes on to tell me about a book he read called          The Dancing Wu Li Masters,           about quantum physics and a \"dramatic turn you didn't expect helps you see past the physical to something more.\" He adds: \"Hopefully from the          pain generates some kind of growth.

He is extremely famous-the kind of Hollywood personality who is suddenly recognized on a family trip to a theme park. But he's also in some ways starting fresh. After a decade trying to please fanboys (and the multinational conglomerates that own their favorite iconic characters), Snyder is finally playing in his own sandbox-creating characters and worlds out of whole cloth (or greenscreen, at least). Was that part of            Rebel Moon's            appeal? \"One hundred percent,\" he says. \"That's the            why            of everything. Canon is cool but it's also very limiting. I'm a fan of deconstruction. Sometimes it can be difficult to participate in deconstruction as far as beloved characters are concerned. People feel an affront.\"                </p><p>         It's worth noting that Snyder recently renamed his company Stone Quarry, a reference to another of his favorite books, Ayn Rand's          The Fountainhead.          When no one will pay that book's hero, the architect Howard Roark, to design and build to his exacting standards, he ends up working at a granite quarry.       </p><p>         The screen may be smaller. And Snyder acknowledges fans might watch          Rebel Moon          on a cell phone. But his approach to making art hasn't changed. Snyder, a camera nerd, designed his own custom lenses to better mimic the magic of shooting on film. \"Because the digital cameras are pretty cold in the way they record,\" Snyder          explains. \"Where when you use a film camera, there is a chemical process that imbues the photography with some other alchemy that you can't plan for. And that alchemy is that intangible thing that makes the movie have a soul. That's what this lens's job is. Between you and the chip, I put God.\"       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4467ffd536494b0289ae8dbf27f2ca35\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>         With Dave Bautista on the set of 2021's            Army of the Dead                </p><p>         Says Debbie of          Rebel Moon:          \"At his core, Zack is most fascinated with a hero's journey and a redemptive story. What makes people do what they do? I think for him the most fascinating heroes are the ones that aren't necessarily just good-that they might live in a gray area. That you can still be a hero without being perfect.\"       </p><p>         I wonder if Snyder is at all relieved that DC's beleaguered          Aquaman          sequel (beset by \"3 reshoots, two Batmans and nonstop test screenings,\" says          The Hollywood Reporter)          is someone else's midnight phone call now. \"Am I relieved?\" he says. \"Well, I get anxiety just because I know what it feels like. It's too personal for me to feel anything like that,\" adding: \"The movie's probably fine. I mean, I don't know. Who knows?\"       </p><p>                    On the way out, Snyder takes me to his pottery studio, the one in the handsome shipping container. In a way, it's a return to his fine-art roots-and a Zen place to put the energy that wakes him up every morning at 4:30            A.M.            He shows me a shelf lined with his yet-to-be-fired coffee mugs, each stamped on the underside with the letter                   Z          (in a font not dissimilar to the          S          that adorns Superman's chest). Imperfections in pottery are part of the medium's charm, but he's still tinkering with the shape and size of his mugs, wanting to get the proportions and coloring just right.       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"6162a2ed67c84cc288510f8af69197f3\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>                    And on the set of            Rebel Moon            with Michiel Huisman and Sofia Boutella.                </p><p>         Getting into ceramics was his wife's idea. \"I was playing a lot of Fortnite,\" Snyder says. \"I was really deep in Fortnite. Debbie was like, 'This is          no bueno.'          \" That he feels the need to add he was \"winning a lot\" makes me laugh, but one does not succeed in Hollywood without a competitive spirit. He concedes he was basically \"addicted.\" When Debbie got him some clay for his birthday, he says, \"I quit cold turkey.\"       </p><p>         Snyder fires his work here in the kiln, but he makes most of the pieces up in the house-at the dining-room table, surrounded by his family. \"That way I'm not a recluse potter,\" he says.       </p><p>         Here, he unwraps some of his latest work for me. \"I made my daughter this rabbit,\" he says, smiling. \"I made her this hedgehog. And this bear. She was like, Can you make something for me?\" As he says this, a few broken pieces tumble out of a napkin-a bespoke animal lost in transit.       </p><p>\"That's liable to happen,\" Snyder says. \"The dangers of this work is that it falls apart.

Devastating fires and floods. Rising temperatures. Deadly heatwaves and cold spells. The extinction of an increasing number of plant and animal species. Climate change is threatening the world's biodiversity and even human existence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lessons for surviving these dramatic changes can be found in the experiences of the world's Indigenous people, according to California State University, Northridge history professor Natale Zappia, director of CSUN's Institute for Sustainability.</p><p>Zappia is part of an international team of historical researchers who have received a $1.43 million grant from the Swedish Government Research Council to compare the experiences in Native North America and Nordic Sapmi. It is an effort understand how Indigenous societies survived when faced with devastating challenges caused by the twin forces of colonialism and environmental change.</p><p>\"When one thinks of climate change and Indigenous experiences historically, what is discussed are disasters, folklore or situations that are victim-focused,\" said Zappia, who teaches in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \"It's time we started thinking about those experiences as solution-based, and as inspiration. Not only have these communities survived, but, in many instances, they have found opportunities to thrive. That's why a lot of scientists are beginning to collaborate with these communities. They actually have answers that could be applied when thinking about how we, as a global community, deal with the impact of climate change, whether forest fire mitigation or thinking about aquaculture as a way of addressing global food insecurity.</p><p>\"It's the role of historians,\" he said. \"to remind us that we have to learn from the past and build on that knowledge in order to move forward as we look to the future.\"</p><p>The project is hosted by Linnaeus University Centre for Concurrences in Colonial and Postcolonial Studies in Sweden. In addition to Zappia, the project's researchers include Gunlog Fur, deputy vice chancellor for sustainability at Linnaeus University; Sami artist Pirak Sikku; Sami Lakomaki, an associate professor of ethnohistory at Oulu University in Finland; history research fellow Janne Lahti with Helsinki University in Finland; and researcher Lindsay Doran with University of Eastern Finland.</p><p>The researchers will work closely with Indigenous communities in Scandinavia -- in particular the Sami community, the people native to the Nordic region of the globe, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and part of Russia -- and Southern California, including members of the Chumash, Tataviam, and Kizh-Gabrieleno communities.</p><p>\"Members of these communities will be true partners as we move forward with our research,\" Zappia said. \"They will be in the center of the dialogue. We hope to provide several opportunities for these communities to talk, both in person and online, so they, and we, can learn about their experiences and the lessons from those experiences that have helped their communities move forward.\"</p><p>Zappia said the researchers hope these conversations will shed light on Indigenous survivance -- a term coined by Anishinaabe novelist Gerald Vizenor to describe the active agency involved in survival -- and inspire dialogue among policy makers on how to face the unthinkable consequences of global climate change and biodiversity loss.</p><p>The researchers will be examining the importance of cultural practices, arts and traditional knowledge as key reasons for Indigenous survivance.</p><p>Zappia said the information they learn will be important for \"understanding and identifying human responses to climate change and loss so biodiversity.\"</p><p>The project focuses on three themes -- bordered spaces and remembered land, colonial education and traditional knowledge, and mapping native spaces and lifeways -- which identify historical processes in North America and the Nordic region when subsistence and livelihood irrevocably changed for Indigenous communities.</p><p>The researchers will examine the impact borders imposed on the Indigenous peoples in the American West and in Sapmi from the 1850s to the early 1900s that severely affected land use and ecological conditions. They will also explore the efforts of colonial residential schools to fundamentally alter how Indigenous people understood, used and valued land.</p><p>One of the most pervasive ways of erasing Indigenous spaces occurred through mapping practices.</p><p>\"Colonial maps replaced Indigenous placenames and hid complex histories of land use under blank spaces indicating uninhabited territory,\" said Zappia, whose work will be focusing on mapping. This theme will compare three sites during different time periods to understand how competing cartographic cultures recorded, facilitated, resisted and engaged the environmental changes wrought by colonialism.</p><p>As part of this effort, Zappia will also be working with members of the Chumash, Tataviam, and Kizh-Gabrieleno communities to remap Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge in Los Angeles, one of the most densely urbanized regions of the United States.</p><p>\"So much of this project will be exploratory, which is probably why historians don't usually get grants of this size,\" Zappia said, with a laugh. \"We aren't exactly sure what the outcome is going to be. But then, these communities, that have so much to teach us, really have never had an opportunity to talk about shared and unique experiences.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/media-releases/csun-prof-part-international-effort-studying-indigenous-history-for-keys-to-surviving-climate-change/\">https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/media-releases/csun-prof-part-international-effort-studying-indigenous-history-for-keys-to-surviving-climate-change/</url></p><p>Contact: Carmen Ramos Chandler, 818/677-2130, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:carmen.chandler@csun.edu\">carmen.chandler@csun.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>C22-SUharpal-8009065 C22-SUharpal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8009065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6706-BF71-DYG2-R4BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 30, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Such analysis of the energy and financial losses due to the direct and indirect effects of forest fires on the production of solar plants can help grid operators to plan and schedule power generation, as also the distribution, supply, security, and overall stability of power production.</p><p>Recently, solar energy generation has been widely used in developing countries such as India which has sufficient solar resources. However, several factors like clouds, aerosols, and pollution generated from various sources limit the solar irradiance causing performance issues in the photovoltaic and concentrated solar power plant installations. Large-scale development of a solar energy system requires proper planning, and there is a need to estimate the solar potential</p><p>Keeping this in mind, a group of researchers at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital an autonomous research institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) Govt. of India, and the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), Greece tried to trace the factors that reduce solar energy production. They found that apart from clouds and aerosols, forest fires play a very crucial role in reducing solar energy production.</p><p>The study published in the international peer-reviewed journal Remote Sensing shows that the aerosol optical depth values were up to 1.8 during the study period (January to April 2021), during which massive forest fire events led to attenuation of total solar radiation incident on a horizontal surface (global horizontal irradiance- GHI ) and solar radiation received from the sun without having been scattered (beam horizontal irradiance --BHI) by 0 to 45%. During this period the air masses were renewed quickly mitigating the smoke contribution to the total aerosol loads and were dominated by continental pollution.</p><p>The scientists used remote sensing data for the research and studied the impact of aerosols and clouds on the solar energy potential over the Indian region with extensive analysis and model simulations. They also provided an analytical financial analysis in terms of revenue and losses due to clouds and aerosols.</p><p>The research was led by Dr. Umesh Chandra Dumka, Scientist, ARIES, with contributions by Prof. Panagiotis G Kosmopoulos, Scientist, NOA, and Dr. Piyushkumar N. Patel, Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, USA, and provided a comprehensive investigation of the impact of aerosols and clouds on solar energy production over the region.</p><p>The findings of the present study will drastically increase the awareness among decision-makers about the effect of forest fires on energy management and planning at a country level. In addition, this research can support the mitigation processes and policies for climate change and its direct and indirect impacts on sustainable development.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125174377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:659R-BRM1-DYTH-G3B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 26, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Bulldogs answered in methodical fashion stringing wins of 25-17, 25-16, 25-16 led by the net finishes of Delaney Staples and the serving of Nevaya Adams.</p><p>\"When we got that first win I was really excited but they do what they always do.

Sixty-three organized evacuations have taken place in the past few days, Mitsotakis said in a televised address on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He also apologized \"for any weaknesses\" on the part of the government in containing the wildfires, which have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced people to evacuate dozens of villages over the past week.</p><p>\"These last days have been some of the most difficult for our country in decades,\" Mitsotakis said, citing the extreme heat and months of drought as issues that have complicated firefighting efforts.</p><p>Greece's second-largest island, Evia, has been at the center of the storm of fires that have ravaged the country. Over half of the island has burned, according to local officials.</p><p>The fires have been devastating for Greeks who rely on the forests for their livelihood. In Evia, local residents told CNN that national assistance came too late. And their produce -- including resin, honey, olives and figs -- has been destroyed in the flames.</p><p>Climate warning </p><p>Environmental authorities have warned that southern Europe, where droughts are becoming more frequent and severe, is at the greatest risk from the impacts of climate change on the continent.</p><p>\"It is obvious that the climate crisis is affecting the whole planet,\" Mitsotakis said. \"That is the explanation, but not an excuse, or an alibi. We may have done everything that was humanly possible, but in many cases this did not seem to be enough in the unequal battle with nature,\" he added.</p><p>On Monday, a state-of-the-science report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html\">it is \"unequivocal\" that humans have caused the climate crisis </url>and confirmed that \"widespread and rapid changes\" have already occurred, some of them irreversibly.</p><p>Scientists are more confident than ever in connecting the dots between the climate crisis and extreme weather: globally, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently, according to the report. And amid unrelenting drought and record heat, wildfire seasons are now longer and result in more destructive fires.</p><p>While Europe has battled wildfires for weeks, across the Mediterranean, North Africa is also facing the threat. At least 25 Algerian People's National Army members have been killed while fighting wildfires east of the Algerian capital Algiers since Monday, the country's president Abdelmadjid Tebboune said in a post to Twitter on Tuesday.</p><p>The country has recorded 103 fires in 17 provinces since Monday, according to the Algeria Press Service (APS) report on Tuesday.</p><p>The military personnel died after rescuing more than 100 people \"from the blazing fires\" in the mountains of Bejaia and Tizi -Ouzou in the east of the capital.</p><p>Anger at government response </p><p>Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the Greek Parliament in Athens on Monday over the government's handling of the wildfires.</p><p>\"We are protesting against the government that has let all the country burn, because of profits before people,\" demonstrator Nikos Loutos told Reuters. \"We are protesting because they give millions for buying warplanes and police and not for the fire brigade.\"</p><p>Another protester, Anna Mitilineou, said: \"There is a lot of rage in the public because they have not staffed the special forest fire brigade. The forest fire brigade puts out fires in the forests, not the regular firefighters, and they dismantled them, that is why we are burning.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Mitsotakis said any failures in Greece's firefighting response will be identified, those responsible will be held to account and people whose property was destroyed will be compensated.</p><p>The prime minister will chair a cabinet meeting on Tuesday which will announce specific measures to tackle the effects of the wildfires.         </p><p>             Chris Liakos and Elinda Labropoulou reported from Evia, Greece.

According to news reporting out of Islamabad, Pakistan, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach for the evaluation of Multiple Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (MUAV) wildfire monitoring systems for remote and hard-to-reach areas. Emerging environmental factors are causing a higher number of wildfires and keeping these fires in check is becoming a global challenge.\"</p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National University of Science and Technology (NUST): \"MUAV deployment for the monitoring and surveillance of potential fires has already been established. However, most of the scholarly work is still focused on MUAV operations details. In wildfire surveillance and monitoring, evaluations of the system-level performance in terms of the analysis of the effects of individual behavior on system surveillance has yet to be established. Especially in an MUAV system, the individual and cooperative behaviors of the team affect the overall performance of the system. Such systems are dynamic and stochastic because of an ever-changing environment. Quantifying the emergent system behavior and general performance measures of such a system by analytical methods is challenging. In our work, we present an agent-based model for MUAV surveillance missions. This paper focuses on the overall system performance of cooperative UAVs performing forest fire surveillance. The principal theme is to present the effects of three behaviors on overall performance: (1) the area allocation and (2) dynamic coverage, and (3) the effects of forest density on team allocation. For area allocation, three behaviors are simulated: (1) randomized, (2) two-layer barrier sweep coverage, and (3) full sweep coverage. For dynamic coverage, the effects of communication and resource unavailability during the mission are studied by analyzing the agent's downtime spent on refueling.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Last, an extensive simulation is carried out on wildfire models with varying forest density. It is found that cooperative complete sweep coverage strategies perform better than the rest and the performance of the team is greatly affected by the forest density.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: System-Level Performance Analysis of Cooperative Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Wildfire Surveillance Using Agent-Based Modeling. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sustainability</emphasis>, 2022,14(5927):5927.

What measures need to be taken? What lessons can be learned from past disasters? The HEIMDproject provides answers via a digital platform that collects all of this information.</p><p>At the virtual final presentation of the project, the benefits that it can offer were demonstrated, for example in the event of a forest fire. The German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) Institute of Communications and Navigation has coordinated the international project, while the Earth Observation Center (EOC) at DLR processed the satellite data.</p><p>Smoke rises from an area of forest near the Spanish city of Girona. It is not a real fire, but a simulation that illustrates the capabilities of the HEIMDplatform. Firefighters can mark out the extent of the suspected fire on a screen. A swam of drones is deployed, its flight path determined by an algorithm. This not only enables a view of the fire from above, but also provides detailed information about the build-up of heat.</p><p>This can be used to pinpoint the hotspots of the fire, which can start new fires and pose a threat to firefighters. The system is able to detect hotspots that measure just 15 centimetres across. Weather data are also fed into the analysis, along with empirical values from past catastrophic fires. This allows those involved to quickly devise a strategy for fighting the fire.</p><p>\"Improving responsiveness will ultimately save lives\"</p><p>\"The HEIMDplatform helps first responders and authorities to deal with various situations,\" says Tomaso de Cola, Project Manager at the DLR Institute of Communications and Navigation in Oberpfaffenhofen. \"Improving responsiveness and optimising reaction times will ultimately save lives.\"</p><p>Satellite data play a major role in disaster management. They provide location-based information and allow responders to assess emergency situations more effectively. With that in mind, DLR compiles situational information and risk assessments, which may show, for example, how trapped persons might be reached. The satellite data are recorded, analysed and processed within a short space of time. Alongside this, the archive provides information about the course of previous disasters.</p><p>The HEIMDplatform can be used not only in the event of fires, but also in cases of flooding, flash floods and landslides; this was explained at the final presentation in Spain. The platform facilitates cooperation between different authorities and institutions. Those involved can exchange information, look at disaster scenarios from the past and obtain information to aid decision-making.</p><p>Cross-border cooperation is also possible. Information and images from firefighters and other rescue personnel on site can be integrated into the situational overview immediately using a dedicated app. Warning the local population is another aspect of the platform. \"The HEIMDplatform can contribute to a better joint emergency response,\" says Tomaso de Cola.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPCDLY-202102032307265016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPCDLY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61XH-V461-JC3D-Y35K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288597</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Space Daily, Distributed by United Press International</copyright><publicationName>Space Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 3, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>digital-platform-helps-rescue-services-during-natural-disasters</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Economic growth is slowing and, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/economy/june-jobs-report-preview/index.html\">so is the job market</url>. Cracks are forming in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/business/nightcap-housing-market-europe-gas/index.html\">home-building and home-buying markets</url> as mortgage rates have surged. Consumer sentiment has plunged. No wonder stocks are in bear territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alongside the slow, steady drip of sour economic data, investors have fallen into a foul mood. CNN Business' <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed\">Fear &amp; Greed index</url> has been stuck in \"Fear\" territory for months. But the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/economy/recession-economy-federal-reserve-gdp/index.html\">anticipation</url> of pain is often worse than reality, and the stock market is hoping someone will just rip the Band-Aid off, and declare a recession already.</p><p>The longer we talk about a recession,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html\"> the more likely it is that the economy will continue to ache</url>, said Ritholtz Wealth CEO Josh Brown. Recession fears themselves lead to more pullback. Consumer and investor psychology impacts the economy and we can \"talk ourselves into a recession,\" he wrote in a note.</p><p>\"If enough people believe it's time to rein in their spending -- and then act on that belief -- it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" said Brown.</p><p>Recessions are inevitable, they're a part of every business cycle. Recessions will happen, and no amount of predicting and prognosticating can prevent them.</p><p>That's why some Wall Street analysts are hoping, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/economy/recession-economists-nber/index.html\">the National Bureau of Economic Research</url> will officially determine we're in a recession and allow markets to break the dread cycle.</p><p>\"The sooner we get the recession, the better,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment research manager at Charles Schwab.</p><p>Although that may seem counter-intuitive, pulling forward the recession's start date would ultimately be a positive for investors, Gordon said. That's because a recession would mean the turning point for stocks is closer rather than further away, and that the bottom is closer than we think.</p><p>Then, investors could move onto the next cycle: searching for hope. Economists liken it to finding green shoots after a forest fire.</p><p>\"While it may seem economically bullish to assume the recession starts sometime in 2023, it's actually market bearish, especially if you are of the belief that the market still has to price in more downside for earnings,\" said Gordon.</p><p>A recession in 2023 could give us another half year of bearish markets, further harming the economy. But an earlier recession determination means an earlier recovery. It means a quicker return of risk appetite and increase in corporate profits. Wall Street's corporate profits have never grown overall when the economy was moving toward recession.</p><p>Most importantly, it would mean inflation pressures would decrease more quickly and the Fed would be able to end its tightening policy sooner, minimizing economic damage and increasing investment opportunities.</p><p>The problem is the NBER is notoriously slow at announcing when we're in a recession.  It didn't announce until June 2020 that the pandemic-induced recession had begun in February - and that was faster than usual.</p><p>So, sadly for Wall Street investors looking for some relief, the recession debate will almost certainly carry on for months.</p><p>Bank of America analysts, meanwhile, predict a \"mild recession\" will begin this year in the United States and will abate by 2023.</p><p>Recession is never a good thing, but a short and shallow recession now is better than a large and looming threat in the distance.         </p><p>             By Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Ranger Nelson is one of two people to earn this national recognition in 2021.</p><p>\"Maine is the most heavily forested state in the country, which means that wildfire prevention is something that we must take very seriously,\" said Governor Mills . \"It is why Maine Forest Service Rangers, like Ranger Specialist Kent Nelson, are so important. Their efforts, along with those of fire departments across Maine, are critical to keeping our state safe. I am honored to congratulate Specialist Nelson on this well-deserved recognition and thank him for his efforts to safeguard our forests and protect Maine people.\"</p><p>\"Creating awareness of ways to reduce human-caused wildfires ignition is a critical role for Maine Forest Service, and Ranger Specialist Kent Nelson is a gifted and talented ambassador to this cause who has repeatedly demonstrated creativity and innovation in crafting and disseminating engaging and effective messaging to educate the public,\" added DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal .</p><p>Smokey Bear awards have been bestowed on well-deserving groups and individuals annually since 1957. The Silver Smokey Bear Award specifically recognizes organizations or individuals for outstanding wildfire prevention service that is regional (multistate) in scope over at least a two-year period. The National Association of State Foresters, the USDA Forest Service, and The Ad Council sponsor the Awards, and nominations are considered and voted upon by members of the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Committee.</p><p>Maine Forest Service Director and State Forester Patty Cormier and Chief Forest Ranger Bill Hamilton joined Governor Mills and DACF Commissioner Beal to present Ranger Nelson with the award today.</p><p>Ranger Nelson has worked in the Maine Forest Service for two decades, serving as Maine's wildfire prevention specialist a role in which he administers Maines wildfire prevention and FireWise programs and raises public awareness on how to prevent wildfires. In 2019, with Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact colleagues, Ranger Nelson implemented a year-long campaign dedicated to preventing wildfires by celebrating Smokey Bear's 75th birthday.</p><p>At today's Silver Smokey Bear Award event, the Governor proclaimed April 18-24 as Wildfire Awareness Week in Maine.</p><p>Maine has already seen over 100 wildfires in 2021, and 2020 was a record-breaking year. During Wildfire Awareness Week, the MFS Forest Protection Division and municipal fire departments need everyone's support to prevent wildfires. Maine averages over 550 wildfires annually, over ninety percent of which are caused by people, destroy valuable natural resources, property, and threaten human life.</p><p>Wildfire safety starts with knowing and obeying local laws and regulations. Everyone is asked to check with their town hall, local fire service, or the Maine Forest Service before burning. Other critical steps to preventing wildfires include mindfulness of weather conditions, particularly wind, and using only easily controlled locations for burning. Most importantly, never use flammable gas-propellants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124389603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FB-BJ61-DYTH-G04C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 13, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Only 1,100 people live in Red Sucker Lake.<br/>In recent years, suicide epidemics on remote reserves have compelled band councils to declare states of emergency. Chief Knott told the CBC that his community \"hit its tipping point on Tuesday, when a 16-year-old killed himself on the school playground.\" The highly visible way in which the poor boy took his life suggests he wanted to send a final message. Details about the boy's suicide were not disclosed.<br/>\"We had this young person that was very quiet,\" an A-student who \"never missed a school date,\" lamented Knott. As is typical with youth suicide cases on reserves, there was no mention of any suicide note being left behind to offer some explanation of why the boy chose this fatal path. Knott explained this tragedy as a consequence of \"the fact that there are very few activities to keep young people in the First Nation occupied and help them realize their potential.\"<br/>In a stunning understatement, \"Knott says there are other long-standing issues that need to be addressed.\"<br/>While Knott didn't recite the usual root causes of residential schools, intergenerational trauma and colonization, he did mention the desperate condition common to all remote reserves (accessibly only by air or winter road): chronic unemployment ranging above 80 percent with no relief in sight. Knott acknowledged some of the social pathologies that comes with such hopelessness: alcoholism and drug abuse. He didn't speak about the sexual abuse and violence that often follows substance abuse in isolated, close quarters.<br/>\"We're struggling big time in all areas of the community. We're in need of a huge support,\" pleaded Knott. He called for a crisis team and mental health counselors to be immediately deployed to help prevent any further suicides. Changing people's reaction to a wilderness ghetto doesn't change the realization that they are living in a wilderness ghetto.<br/>Those of us living anywhere else would get nervous when unemployment rates near 8 percent. Imagine living some place where unemployment never dips below 80 percent and hasn't for as long as anyone can remember? Think of your parents and how different they might have been if they never had a job. Think of the thousands of people trying to escape poverty in Central America; they can at least resort to the desperate measure of walking away from a hopeless place. People on remote reserves don't have that option. The common escape is drugs and booze and now, increasingly, suicide.<br/>In all the years that I have been paying attention to Aboriginal issues, the wilderness ghettos are the most irresolute. There is no amount of human tragedy, no number of youth suicides that will ever convince anyone in government or anyone in any of the myriad of Aboriginal lobby groups or anyone teaching Native Studies anywhere that the remote reserves need to be closed. At best there will be calls for more funding and the increasingly frequent call for emergency mental health professionals to be parachuted in. But it's like throwing teacups of water at a forest fire from a helicopter.<br/>To the extent that Aboriginal advocates acknowledge the sheer despair of the remote reserves, their public response is to directly promote all reserves as remaining strongholds of traditional culture. Their indirect strategy is to preserve the reserve system in its entirety regardless of how hopeless the most remote reserves are because the Aboriginal leadership's objective is Aboriginal sovereignty. Without a land base, sovereignty is meaningless. If the leaders allow the Canadian government to close a single reserve even for humane reasons, it will not only set a precedent for shutting down reserves, it will demonstrate the vanity of Aboriginal sovereignty. The Devil would sooner relent.<br/>To achieve the dream of Aboriginal sovereignty, lately energized by the 'Land Back' movement, suffering the nightmare of the wilderness ghettos is a necessary price and Canada's shame. Theirs is not the sacrifice. If we\u00a0truly wanted\u00a0to help Aboriginal\u00a0youths on hopeless remote reserves,\u00a0we would begin talking about dismantling the quasi-segregationist reserve system.\u00a0A child's hope can't blossom in a hopeless wilderness ghetto.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Michael Melanson is a writer living in Winnipeg.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-171947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66S6-BT61-JCG7-83FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frontier Center, Canada All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Frontier Centre For Public Policy</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 1, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Uncategorized</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001647</classCode><className>SUICIDE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

It's the worst month for fire in the Amazon in over a decade. Satellite sensors detected over 42,000 fires in 30 days according to Brazil's national space institute. It is the first time since 2010 that fires in the Amazon surpassed 40,000 in a single month. </p><p>This September was 2 \u00c2\u00bd times worse than last. Coming at the peak of the dry season, it's usually the worst month not only for fire but also for deforestation. The official data for forest loss only goes through Sept. 23 so far, yet is already 14 percent more devastating than September 2021. In just those three weeks, the Amazon lost 434 square miles of rainforest, an area larger than New York City. The surge in forest fire occurs amid a polarizing presidential campaign. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking a second four-year term against leftist Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva, who ruled Brazil between 2003 and 2010. The two presidential candidates will face each other in a runoff vote Oct. 30 after neither got enough support to win outright Sunday in the election. Despite the smoke clogging the air of entire Amazon cities, state elections have largely ignored environmental issues. Besides the president, Brazilians will also elect governors and state and national parliaments. In Par\u00c3\u00a1 state, worst for both deforestation and fire, the subject of deforestation was barely touched on during a TV debate among gubernatorial candidates held Tuesday by the Globo network. Over an hour and a half, only one candidate mentioned the steep increase in deforestation. Globo, Brazil's leading television network, did not even select it as one of eight debate topics. Protecting the forest is not a high-priority for the population, after years of pandemic and a deteriorating economy, Paulo Barreto, a researcher with the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, told the Associated Press. \"But the fact that journalists don't ask is an even bigger problem.\" Deforestation can lead to more poverty, he said. \"On the other hand, there are growing economic opportunities related to conservation.\" Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, to improve cattle pasture or burn recently felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and reach pristine forest areas. Studies have shown that deforestation rates peak in election years, and 2022 has been particularly intense because of Bolsonaro's anti-environmental rhetoric, according to analysts. \"With a chance of changing the government to one that promises more rigor, it seems that the deforesters are taking advantage of the possibility that the party's over,\" Barreto said. Since Bolsonaro took office in 2019, deforestation has been on the rise, as his administration has defanged environmental authorities and backed measures to loosen land protections, emboldening environmental offenders. The far-right leader has repeatedly denied that fire is even increasing, despite official data from his government agency. On Thursday night, during the final presidential debate before the vote, he said that forest fires occur periodically in the Amazon, dismissed the criticism as a \"war of narratives\" and said Brazil \"is an example to the world\" on conservation. It was an answer to Simone Tebet, a senator who is close to agribusiness leaders and considered a moderate in the race. In one the of the few moments free of personal insults, she criticized Bolsonaro's environmental record in a segment related to climate change. \"Your administration is the one that has set biomes, forests and my Pantanal wetlands on fire. Your administration favored miners and loggers, and protected them,\" she said. \"You, in this regard, were the worst president in Brazil's history.\" During his campaign, da Silva promised to restore law enforcement and gained support from Indigenous and environmental leaders, such as former Environment Minister Marina Silva. She had broken publicly with the former president over his push to build hydroelectric dams and other development initiatives in the Amazon. In announcing her support during a meeting with da Silva a few weeks ago, she called Bolsonaro a threat to Brazil's democracy. She said the country is facing a critical moment on issues ranging from the environment to the economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-000001839defd9e4a99bfdef00310000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66RV-HKC1-JBSK-R2J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 3, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Legislators hit the ground running with back-to-back committee meetings in both chambers, hearing dozens of bills. Since the House passed their state budget bill two weeks ago, the Senate will now go through their budget process, before sending the budget to a conference committee with the House. And with the crossover deadline approaching on May 4th, lawmakers are expected to continue their busy schedule throughout the coming weeks. As the deadline approaches, lawmakers will be moving steadily to get their bills passed through at least one chamber.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Transgender Athletes </p><p> The North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation this week that would prevent transgender female athletes from participating in girls' sports teams in middle school, high school, and college. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H574v2.pdf\">House Bill 574: The Fairness in Women's Sports Act</url>  was filed by Representative Jennifer Balkom (R-Henderson) several weeks ago, and passed this week by a 73-39 vote in the House. Three Democrats joined all Republicans to support the bill. A Senate companion of the bill, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/Senate/PDF/S631v2.pdf\">Senate Bill 631</url> , also passed this week, along party lines. These bills are among several introduced this month that would impact transgender people, including restrictions on gender-affirming medical procedures for trans youth and criminal penalties for public performances by some 'male or female impersonators.'</p><p> The legislation would prohibit male students from playing on middle or high school teams designated for females and require athletic participation to be recognized solely based on reproductive biology and genetics at birth. Female students would be allowed to play on male sports teams only if there is no comparable female team in the same sport at the school.</p><p> Supporters of the bill argue that it ensures fairness in sports and protects women's sports from being dominated by transgender athletes. Republican lawmakers invited twelve-time All-American swimmer, Riley Gaines, who was defeated in a match by a transgender swimmer, to speak in favor of the bill at three committee meetings.</p><p> Opponents of the legislation, including Democrats and LGBTQ lawmakers, argue that it discriminates against transgender athletes and encourages discrimination and stereotypes against them. Representative Vernetta Alston, who is gay and one of the few LGBTQ lawmakers in the General Assembly, called the bill 'part of what I think is a larger effort to ban transgender people from living their lives openly.'</p><p> Similar legislation has been introduced in 20 other states, with proponents arguing that allowing transgender female athletes to compete against cisgender females is unfair due to physiological differences in strength and athletic ability. However, critics argue that such legislation is discriminatory and violates the rights of transgender individuals. Earlier this month, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22a800_e1p3.pdf\">Supreme Court refused</url>  to reinstate a West Virginia law that would have banned transgender athletes from participating in athletics.</p><p> Annual Farm Act </p><p> This week the North Carolina Senate Agriculture, Energy and Environment Committee advanced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/Senate/PDF/S582v2.pdf\">Senate Bill 582: North Carolina Farm Act of 2023</url> , with bipartisan support. This bill is an omnibus package of various policies that affect a wide range of agricultural industries, including hog farms, forest fires, muscadine grape juice, and more.</p><p> Most of the bill's 20 sections are noncontroversial. However, two sections drew concerns from environmentalists. The Southern Environmental Law Center distributed a fact sheet to Senators in the committee expressing worry about a section that loosens restrictions on how hog farms use digestors to release gases captured from waste lagoons. This section allows hog farms to vent more methane gas from waste pits. The group said in the fact sheet, \"With this change, venting and flaring - and harming the climate - is explicitly allowed.\" Some state lawmakers changed regulations in recent years to make it easier for farmers to capture that gas and feed it to utility companies that burn it to produce electricity.</p><p> The NC Pork Council says the changes are needed to allow temporary flaring at times and to let farmers plan for the future, installing equipment it takes to collect and sell methane before the pipes that are needed to transport the gas reach their farm.</p><p> Additionally, some Democrats raised concerns during the committee about a section that would tie North Carolina's wetland protections with federal rules. According to Senator Brent Jackson (R-Sampson), a farmer and the bill's sponsor, the section would align North Carolina's wetland rules with whatever emerges from a series of federal lawsuits where the \"federal waters of the United States\" rules are being challenged.</p><p> Senator Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said she was \"cautious to support rules we don't know the consequences of.\" A representative from the Southern Environmental Law Center told committee members that state regulations \"fill in a gap\" while federal jurisdiction over wetlands is in flux.</p><p> Other parts of the Farm Act are less controversial, including prohibiting unmanned aircraft, like drones, from being used near a forest fire, and boosting penalties for operators who spill animal waste along state roadways and leave the scene.</p><p> The bill now goes to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further discussion and a vote.</p><p>Community College Governance </p><p>North Carolina's community college system could see a significant shift in governance if <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/Senate/PDF/S692v2.pdf\">Senate Bill 692: Community College Governance</url>  is enacted into law. The bill would give the Republican-controlled General Assembly powers that currently belong to Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. These powers include appointing the community college leader, appointing members to each campus board, and making appointments to the State Board of Community Colleges. Currently, the responsibility of naming the Community College System President lies with the State Board. This bill proposes that the General Assembly take on that responsibility.</p><p> Not only would the General Assembly gain more power, but the community college system president would also have increased budget authority and be able to give reports to the General Assembly without the Board's approval. Additionally, the president would be authorized to give their formal recommendation to approve or deny the Local Board's choice to the State Board of Community Colleges.</p><p> The bill's sponsor Senator Tom McInnis (R-Moore) said it 'is imperative that local officials play a role in determining the future of their community college. By having the county commissioners and the General Assembly members appoint the boards, we will be able to have boards that best represent the needs of our residents, students, and employers.'</p><p> The bill passed the Senate Higher Education Committee this week with objections from some Democrats. It now goes to the Senate Rules Committee.</p><p> School Discipline </p><p> A bill that requires governing bodies of public school units to use best practices when developing and enforcing discipline policies and to avoid discriminating against students on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or disability passed the North Carolina House this week. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H188v1.pdf\">House Bill 188: Standards of Student Conduct</url>  would encourage school officials to use in-school suspension instead of other punishments that would remove the student from the school building. The language in the statute that provides examples of conduct that would not be deemed serious violations of the Code of Student Conduct would also be removed.</p><p> Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) expressed concerns that the bill could lead to increased suspension rates among Black students, who are already suspended at higher rates than white students. 'Even though the language says use best practices and do not discriminate, it does affect our African American and children of color two to three times the rate of our white kids,' she said.</p><p> However, Rep. Ken Fontenot, a Wilson County Republican who is Black, argued that Democrats are underestimating Black students' ability to meet the same standards as white students. \"My parents, who grew up in a time when they could be found hanging from a tree, taught me that nothing can stop me from succeeding,\" he said.</p><p> The bill's passage comes as school crimes are on the rise in North Carolina. <url normalizedValue=\"https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/Meetings/Attachment.aspx?S=10399&amp;AID=350663&amp;MID=13622\">A report</url>  published last month by the State Department of Public Instruction shows short-term suspensions up 7% and long-term suspensions up 18% from the 2018-19 school year.</p><p> The bill passed 71-42, with three Democrats joining Republicans. It now goes to the Senate, who did not hear a similar bill in 2021, but may this year due to Republicans possessing a supermajority in both chambers.</p><p> Upcoming Legislative Meetings </p><p> Monday, April 24 </p><p> 3:00PM: House Session</p><p> 4:00PM: Senate Session</p><p> Tuesday, April 25 </p><p> 9:00AM: House Finance</p><p> 10:00AM: House Local Government</p><p> 10:00AM: House Health</p><p> 11:00AM: House Pensions and Retirement</p><p> 1:00PM: Senate Commerce and Insurance</p><p> 1:00PM House Environment</p><p> 1:00PM: House Education K-12</p><p> 2:00PM: Senate Finance</p><p> 3:00PM: House Judiciary 3</p><p> Wednesday, April 26 </p><p> 10:00AM: House Judiciary 2</p><p> 10:00AM: House Marine Resources and Aquaculture</p><p> Thursday, April 27 </p><p> 10:00AM: House State Personnel</p><p> 11:00AM: House Education - Community Colleges</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=05b7dbdf-cf22-45ea-9c0e-e3661e597709\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXJD-JSUP105411168235986093025876100223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6835-2F81-JCMN-Y0CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1569\"/><timeReceived>6:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

And after a few years of study, it's still not clear whether it's any better than what the state's resource managers have long done to manage forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A somewhat new company called 106 Reforestation first presented the concept of \"roller felling\" to an appropriations committee in 2019. The approach strings a chain between two bulldozers, dragging it across the landscape and uprooting vast swaths of vegetation. The method can down 40 acres of trees in a day. The idea is to create an environmental upheaval so disturbance-loving aspen will dominate instead of conifers, resulting in a less fire-prone forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The method has only been used on a few, largely flat private properties on eastern Utah's Tavaputs Plateau. But that hasn't stopped lawmakers from appropriating $4 million or more toward 106 Reforestation's method with little public discussion or debate.</p><p>\"It amazes me how anybody ... could come up with that much money and that much support from the Legislature for something that's completely unknown, that's never been done before,\" said Darren McAvoy, an extension assistant professor of forestry at Utah State University.</p><p>The company's founder and CEO, Mike Siaperas, has a professional background that mostly involves medical billing software, not forest management, according to his LinkedIn profile. But he began tinkering with mechanical tree management on his Tavaputs ranch in the early 2010s. He founded 106 Reforestation in 2017.</p><p>Lawmakers required USU researchers to evaluate Siaperas's roller felling as part of a two-year pilot program on one of his neighbor's properties. However, that study came with a big caveat - the scope didn't allow for an evaluation of how 106 Reforestation's process stacks up against traditional forest management strategies, like commercial logging, prescribed burns and selectively removing certain trees by hand or machine.</p><p>106 Reforestation - ONE from 106 Reforestation on Vimeo.</p><p>\"We need a direct comparison across these methods,\" said Larissa Yocom, an associate professor of fire ecology and one of the USU researchers who spearheaded the USU pilot study, acknowledging the limitations. \"And we need to test it on different landscapes.\"</p><p>Do aspen forests really prevent wildfire?</p><p>The scientists found roller felling does stimulate aspen regrowth, at least in environments suitable for growing them.</p><p>\"Aspen thrives on disturbance,\" whether through fire or getting knocked down, Yocom said. \"As long as roots are not completely ripped out of the ground, it resprouts.\"</p><p>Siaperas and 106 Reforestation rely on a significant presumption, however - that aspen forests are less susceptible to wildfire.</p><p>\"Aspen stands have been proven to be more fire resistant,\" Siaperas wrote in response to an emailed list of questions, \"and do not burn near as catastrophically as pine.\"</p><p>As of now, there's no scientific consensus supporting that idea, according to Yocom.</p><p>\"That's something firefighters know, that forest managers have seen happen, but the evidence hasn't been brought together in one place before,\" Yocom said. \"We took one step back to look at that assumption and see what evidence there is for that, and in which cases it's true, because it's not always true.\"Chris Detrick | The Salt Lake Tribune A USDA Forest Service fire crew work to put out the wildfire burning north of the southern Utah ski town of Brian Head Tuesday, June 20, 2017. (Chris Detrick/)</p><p>After reviewing several dozen studies available on aspen and interviewing firefighters and forest managers, Yocom and her team found large stands of pure - emphasis on pure - aspen in good weather conditions likely do reduce fire risk. But once conifers grow back and mix with the aspen, or shrubs and other vegetation grow in the understory, or dry conditions kick in, those stands can burn quickly and intensely.</p><p>Aspen stands are especially prone to burn and spread wildfire when they're surrounded by a lot of dead, downed wood - and 106 Reforestation's roller felling results in massive slash piles of dead, downed wood.</p><p>\"That's one of the gaping issues,\" Yocom said. \"... The slash piles, if they catch [fire], would be impossible to put out and potentially put the surrounding forest at risk.\"</p><p>Even in a well-managed, careful burn, the piles 106 Reforestation produced would probably get so hot they'd sterilize the soil, researchers said. And the heavy machinery they use could lead to soil compaction.</p><p>\"It's not as good for plants to grow, basically,\" Yocom said. \"You don't get water infiltration and it's hard for living things to get their roots in there.\"</p><p>Loads of unknowns</p><p>The USU study only spanned two years, so it's difficult to know what kind of maintenance roller felling treatments need to keep conifers from growing back or prevent other fuels from building up.</p><p>Roller felling probably will only realistically work on relatively flat ground, like the Tavaputs Plateau, because of dozer access and issues with soil erosion, researchers said. And it costs about the same as some other forestry management methods, according to information researchers presented to lawmakers.</p><p>\"There are pros and cons to any method, and this method is not going to solve all the issues,\" Yocom said. \"It won't work in many places in Utah.\"(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Aspens on the Discovery Trail in Summit County on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. (Trent Nelson/)</p><p>About 200 of the large, fire-prone slash piles remain on private land as a result of the 106 Reforestation pilot, according to Jamie Barnes, director of the Utah Division of Forestry Fire and State Lands, the state agency overseeing the project and managing most of its funds.</p><p>\"My biggest concern with the slash piles,\" Barnes said, \"is who takes responsibility for the burning of those piles?\"</p><p>The 2019 contract, signed before Barnes became director, left it up to the landowner to figure out what to do with the aftermath.</p><p>(Barnes's predecessor, Brian Cottam, worked as a consultant for 106 Reforestation after he left the division, Siaperas confirmed.)</p><p>Because her division is ultimately responsible for any fire that spreads out of control on private, state or unincorporated land, Barnes said the lingering slash piles cause her some \"angst.\"(Utah State University) Photos from a pilot study of 106 Reforestation's unconventional roller felling tree removal show the large slash piles left behind, with researchers circled to show scale of the debris.</p><p>Beyond burning, Siaperas suggested burying or harvesting timber from the slash piles as possible solutions. Or land managers could use the fallout as fences to block grazing wildlife from disturbing new aspen sprouts.</p><p>\"It is our hope that 106 Reforestation can continue to participate with future studies,\" Siaperas wrote, \"so we can understand the outcomes of our treatment methodologies and continue improving upon our conservation efforts.\"</p><p>As Barnes and USU scientists presented their pilot program findings to an interim committee last month, at least one lawmaker expressed concern over the study's limitations and lukewarm findings, along with the Legislature's willingness to back 106 Reforestation without much scrutiny.</p><p>\"I understand the political pressures that were probably applied in moving forward with this,\" said Rep. Casey Snider, R-Paradise, at the hearing.</p><p>But, Snider said, the scientists' inability to compare roller felling with other forestry methods made it difficult to determine how to responsibly delegate taxpayer dollars on wildfire treatments in the future.</p><p>\"This particular method has been one we've appropriated significant money toward, and I suspect going forward we'll be asked for additional appropriations,\" he said. \"... The assumption's going to be made that this is the best way. You didn't say that in your study.\"</p><p>Private trees and public money</p><p>Utah lawmakers budgeted $3.4 million over the last four years for \"strategic and targeted forest fire treatment and mitigation.\" The windfall is meant to fund treatments \"using the mechanical treatment process of 106 Reforestation,\" according to a Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands spokesperson.</p><p>Barnes confirmed $2 million of that money went to 106 Reforestation's Tavaputs Plateau work on private land starting in 2019, although $287,000 has yet to get invoiced and paid.</p><p>Another $900,000 will pay 106 Reforestation for treatment of the Currant Creek Wildlife Management Area, Barnes said, after the Department of Natural Resources put the project out for bid. It'll be the first time the method is tested on public land. The remaining $500,000 hasn't been pegged to a specific project yet, but it could go to 106 Reforestation as well since it's the only company using the treatment process lawmakers singled out.</p><p>This year, lawmakers also gave $1 million to the Atlantis USA Foundation. The nonprofit's website describes it as \"a community of warriors, intellects, leaders and loyalists who are committed to using their strengths to make a difference in the world\" and lists 106 Reforestation as a partner.</p><p>Siaperas confirmed he founded Atlantis. It appears the foundation will aid veterans by recruiting them to work on 106 Reforestation's treatment projects, potentially starting subsidiaries of their own.</p><p>\"In our experience, these military veterans are naturally attracted to conservation work,\" Siaperas wrote, \"and we have found the skills these veterans have are uniquely suited to what's required at 106 Reforestation.\"</p><p>It's unclear whether anyone has invested in Siaperas's roller felling method besides Utah lawmakers. Testimonials on 106 Reforestation's website are mostly current or former state employees (including Cottam) and the manager of the private property used in the state-funded pilot.</p><p>\"We have separate work contracts besides the state,\" Siaperas said when asked if he had other clients.</p><p>McAvoy, with the USU extension, spends much of his time working with private landowners who have large, forested properties. He became familiar with Siaperas's forestry work around a decade ago. He wrote about Siapera's experiments with aspen regeneration in a 2013 newsletter, led a tour of Siapera's Tavaputs ranch in 2015 and gave a virtual presentation about 106 Reforestation in 2020.</p><p>McAvoy said he has a \"positive\" relationship with Siaperas. But he's neutral about property owners' land management ideas and he does not necessarily advocate roller felling.</p><p>\"Forestry professionals, and the [U.S.] Forest Service in particular, have [often said] ... 'We need to increase the pace and scale of treatment to get ahead of wildland fire,'\" McAvoy said. \"Mike has listened to us say this at forestry meetings, and here he's come up with a potential answer.\"</p><p>Still, McAvoy said, the long-term effects of roller felling remain unknown. With all its big equipment, it can't be quickly deployed for an active fire situation. And, after all of his writings and presentations about Siapera's work, McAvoy said he hasn't heard much interest in the method from other landowners. He said he wasn't aware of anyone paying for 106 Reforestation's treatments other than the state.</p><p>\"He's obviously got some strong influence with local legislators,\" McAvoy said. \"It's surprising that the Utah Legislature will support something that's unproven.\"</p><p>Don Peay - an influential big game advocate who has garnered a sizeable amount of state funds himself to lobby against wolves in Utah - has been a vocal supporter of Siaperas, 106 Reforestation and the Atlantis USA Foundation on Capitol Hill.</p><p>This year, Peay even floated 106 Reforestation's roller felling as a way to free up \"liquid gold\" water in arid Utah during an appropriations subcommittee hearing. Salt Lake County Council member Dea Theodore also championed the idea, claiming chopping down conifers (she even suggested using 106 Reforestation specifically) could save the Great Salt Lake. Scientists told The Tribune earlier this year the method is unlikely to create more water and could make things worse.</p><p>\"The 106R process clearly has the most potential in pace and scale,\" Siaperas wrote in his emailed responses, \"to yield more water to Utah in the most expeditious manner with the least amount of disruption.\"</p><p>But Barnes, with the division of forestry, pushed back on that notion.</p><p>\"Removing trees is not going to be the solution to drought,\" she said, \"and is not going to completely mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfire. It's just another tool in the toolbox.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnewsenvironment20230714lawmakersgavemillionssupport</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PD-JGN1-JCB3-X007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 14, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095AD</classCode><className>FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

OSU is at the forefront of forest management research and aims to educate about wildfires.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oregon State University's Forestry Department has been ranked as one of the top forestry programs in the world and the department has several professors that study forest management and fire science.\u00a0</p><p>John Bailey, professor of forest engineering, resources and management, studies wildland fire ecology, prescribed fire and fuel management for fire risk. Bailey specifically has been studying stand structure and dynamics on fire hazards.\u00a0</p><p>\"Stand dynamics is predictable growth of the forest following disturbance-small disturbances or really big ones-in terms of composition and structure,\" Bailey said via email. \"The disturbance can be something like fire, or it can be harvesting or site preparation before planting.\"</p><p>Most fire spread is linked to fine surface fuels, which include grass shrubs and litter close to the forest floor. Practices that focus on these surface fuels can contribute to limiting flame height and rate of spread, Bailey said via email.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Doing this can reduce the probability of fires turning into \"crown fires,\" fires that burn really hot and have embers flying downward that can result in more fires.\u00a0</p><p>According to Bailey, another way to reduce fire spread and reduce the chance of fires turning into crown fires is to remove \"ladder fuel\" through mechanical pruning and mowing or prescribed fires. Ladder fuels are low branches and understory vegetation that allow the fires to reach higher heights.</p><p>\"Trying these kinds of fuel treatments together over the hillside is the shape of the future - we know pretty much what to do, just not so much how much needs to be done and how to connect them,\" Bailey said via email.</p><p>Meg Krawchuk, an associate professor in the department of forest ecosystems and society, focuses on studying fire ecology, landscape ecology and conservation science.\u00a0</p><p>\"I look at the drivers and outcomes of wildland fire,\"\u00a0 Krawchuk said via email. \"At heart, I'm a geographer: I call myself a pyrogeographer.\"</p><p>The biggest challenge she sees facing conservation when talking about forest management and fire risk is weighing the costs and benefits. Fire is an important ecological process in ecosystems; some plants need fire in order to produce seeds like the lodgepole pine and knobcone pine. However, fire does burn outside of its historical range of variability and can result in the loss of homes and lives.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's a balancing act of cost and benefit,\"\u00a0 Krawchuk said via email. \"Sometimes we see a win-win, such as the idea that with more low severity fire in dry forests we can reduce the likelihood of high severity fire. But more often it's trade-offs.\"</p><p>Not only does OSU have several faculty that study forest management and fire risk, but the College of Forestry has a state-funded program called the Forestry and Natural Resources Extension Fire Program, managed by Daniel Leavell, a fire specialist and associate professor of practice, and Carrie Berger, program manager.</p><p>The mission of the program is to \"identify landscapes in highest need of a strategic focus of resources to reduce wildfire and landscape health risks at a statewide scale, assist with the implementation of projects on the ground in priority landscapes and provide fire science-based education and outreach throughout the process for all of Oregon,\" according to the program's website.</p><p>\"It's important to engage the public regularly to address both a better understanding of fire and the management opportunities that are available to landowners and homeowners,\" Leavell said via email.\u00a0</p><p>Leavell wrote that the program has worked to provide education on better management opportunities to reduce fire risk, and has had several workshops, webinars, podcasts and classes throughout the state over the past year.</p><p>\"We need to address fire as a hazard that can be beneficial and detrimental within structures, surrounding structures and across the landscape,\" Leavell said in an email.\u00a0</p><p>With education, the program has assisted in cross-boundary landscape scale forest restoration, wildlife habitat, watershed health, fuel reduction and risk management projects.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"The program is gearing up to place four regional fire specialists within communities across the state, and hopefully two more this spring depending on budgets,\" Berger said via email. \"As such, our ability to provide more fire education and outreach events will grow.\"</p><p>In the future, Berger hopes that the program will be able to increase fire knowledge and lessons, so that the next time a firestorm hits, Oregonians will be equipped to prevent catastrophic loss. She is also hopeful that the program will make a difference in helping to provide a healthy ecosystem that is able to bounce back from major disturbances.\u00a0</p><p>\"Forests are amazing!\" Bailey said via email. \"They provide wood and other non-timber products, clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities and just have value in and of themselves-but they are also fuel, and will burn sooner or later.\"\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4752942</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W9-WDD1-JBSN-30Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Barometer: Oregon State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Corvallis</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OR</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Zoey's mother, Victoria, lost her joy when Zoey's father was killed. When Victoria's grandfather suffers a stroke, she and Zoey relocate to Texas to assist the family. Neither of the characters could have known the part that location would play in helping Zoey's wish come true.</p><p>\"My characters have the same types of problems that we do,\" Egbert said. \"Things happen, and you find your strength in those obstacles on the road.\" Facing a monumental loss at the Christmas season became a major theme in \"Zoey's Christmas Wish.\"</p><p>Although Egbert was a communications major at Wright State University (Lake Campus), she credits her job at the Wapakoneta Daily News with launching her writing career. In the 1980s while working at the newspaper, she began writing special interest stories. From that beginning, she found a love for writing.</p><p>The author credits her dad with being her inspiration. \"If you want something, go for it,\" she recalls him telling her.</p><p>She also noted that he rode horses in Colorado and passed on his love for horses to her. Egbert's dad also loved their pond, so she wrote her first book as a tribute to him. That book, a children's book called, \"Galon the Northern Pintail Duck,\" was written under the Pam Egbert name. Her three subsequent books have been written under her pen name, Samantha Sheridan.</p><p>Unique to Egbert's projects is her method of book promotion. She uses music videos to promote her books, selecting a specific song for each book promotion. For \"Zoey's Christmas Wish,\" Egbert obtained permission from Mark Preston to use his rendition of the song, \"White Christmas,\" to promote her book. Preston has ties to the region. He performed on the Bob Braun Show, was the opening act for Phyllis Diller and later became one of The Lettermen.</p><p>The prelude to \"Zoey's Christmas Wish,\" is a book titled, \"The Silver Heart.\" Egbert admits it is her favorite of the four books she has written. The book was released in 2021, although it was first written in the 1990s \"on an old dot matrix computer with a green screen and floppy disks.\"</p><p>She said the book \"has a little bit of me in it, with the main character's name being Sue, which is my middle name. It starts out with a small-town Ohio girl wanting to be more involved with horses. In the book, real (local) people are featured, including Pete Oen, a horse trainer from Wapakoneta. Pete is now one of the Million Dollar Horse Trainers at his barrel horse ranch in Oklahoma. My daughter, Jaime Quellhorst, is on the front cover of the book with one of our horses, Trooper.\"</p><p>Cece Nagel, daughter of Mike and Shelly Nagel from Wapakoneta, asked Egbert's daughter, Jaime, if she could be written into one of Egbert's books. Jaime shared the young girl's request with the author, and Egbert added Cece to the story as the girl who became Zoey's best friend after Zoey and her mother moved to Texas. Cece Nagel is also featured on the back cover of \"Zoey's Christmas Wish\" with her horse, Tuff.</p><p>When \"The Silver Heart\" launched, Egbert chose to do a fundraiser in Nashville called \"All We Can Do From Our Heart.\" Funds raised from the event, held at The Troubadour Nashville, were donated to \"The Store.\" Brad and Kimberly Paisley opened \"The Store\" to help those needing food and basic necessities. Money from the fundraiser helped feed more than 300 families. During the same fundraiser, LaDonna Brewer-Capps simultaneously released her song, \"All I Can Do.\"</p><p>Another of Egbert's books, \"Smoky Mountain Romance,\" was written after the author attended a banquet for first responders at Lima Memorial Health System. The guest speaker for the event, Randolph Mantooth, discussed the television show, \"Emergency,\" starring Kevin Tighe.</p><p>After watching a few episodes of the program, Egbert wrote the story about what her character Johnny Gage would do if he found the girl of his dreams. The setting for the book is Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and the story line involves a forest fire. The song used to promote the book was, \"Don't Take the Girl,\" by Craig J. Martin, a songwriter who gave her permission for Egbert to use the song and later died from an aneurysm.</p><p>To write the love scenes in her books, Egbert admits that she read some Harlequin romance stories but soon realized, \"I can't write like that. If my grandmother can't read it without me blushing, I don't want it in one of my books.\"</p><p>Egbert identified a few of her own favorite authors. \"Palomino by Danielle Steel had a big impression on me,\" she said. She also enjoys reading books by Nora Roberts and Debbie Macomber as well as books written by celebrities such as Kathy Lee Gifford.</p><p>Some of the challenges of being a writer, according to Egbert, are, \"promoting my book, getting the word out to people and finding a way to reach the readers.\" She responds personally to those who communicate with her through her website, SamanthaSheridanauthor.com. She also plans a book signing at the Riverside Art Center in Wapakoneta in the spring.</p><p>While copies of Egbert's books are not yet available in local libraries, they can be obtained online through Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Goodreads. \"Zoey's Christmas Wish\" is also available through Archway Publishing with free shipping offered.</p><p>Reviews from readers indicate that many enjoy a good love story and appreciate the characters in Egbert's books. One reader, identified as \"Paula,\" wrote, \"It [The Silver Heart] was a book about people loving people, people loving horses, and it pulls at my heart from many angles.\"</p><p>___ (c)2023 The Lima News (Lima, Ohio) Visit The Lima News (Lima, Ohio) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.limaohio.com\">www.limaohio.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCLNOH-20230129LMWishesdocometrueWapakonetaauthor0129LM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">The Lima News (O KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67F7-HX01-DY8S-B177-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474156</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Lima News (Lima, Ohio)</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>The Lima News (Ohio)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 29, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005VQA</classCode><className>SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS513130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC2731 BOOKS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp; PRINTING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009U8Y</classCode><className>CHILDREN'S LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000C49Z</classCode><className>STROKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001328</classCode><className>EQUESTRIAN SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX001</classCode><className>KABUL, AFGHANISTAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS151</classCode><className>OHIO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC508</classCode><className>AFGHANISTAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's the worst month for fire in the Amazon in over a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Satellite sensors detected over 42,000 fires in 30 days according to Brazil's national space institute. It is the first time since 2010 that fires in the Amazon surpassed 40,000 in a single month.</p><p>This September was two and a half times worse than last. Coming at the peak of the dry season, it's usually the worst month not only for fire but also for deforestation.</p><p>The official data for forest loss only goes through September 23 so far, yet is already 14% more devastating than September 2021. In just those three weeks, the Amazon lost 434 square miles, an area larger than New York City.</p><p>The surge in forest fire occurs amid a polarizing presidential campaign. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro is seeking a second four-year term against leftist Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva, who ruled Brazil between 2003 and 2010 and leads in the polls. The first round of the election will be held today.</p><p>Despite the smoke clogging the air of entire Amazon cities, state elections have largely ignored environmental issues. Besides the president, Brazilians will also elect governors and state and national parliaments.</p><p>In Para state, worst for both deforestation and fire, the subject of deforestation was barely touched on during a TV debate among gubernatorial candidates held Tuesday by the Globo network.</p><p>Over an hour and a half, only one candidate mentioned the steep increase in deforestation. Globo, Brazil's leading television network, did not even select it as one of eight debate topics.</p><p>Protecting the forest is not a high-priority for the population, after years of pandemic and a deteriorating economy, Paulo Barreto, a researcher with the nonprofit Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, told the Associated Press. \"But the fact that journalists don't ask is an even bigger problem.\" Deforestation can lead to more poverty, he said. \"On the other hand, there are growing economic opportunities related to conservation.\"</p><p>Fire in the Amazon is almost always deliberately set, to improve cattle pasture or burn recently-felled trees once they are dry. Often the fires burn out of control and reach pristine forest areas.</p><p>Studies have shown that deforestation rates peak in election years, and 2022 has been particularly intense because of Bolsonaro's anti-environmental rhetoric, according to analysts.</p><p>\"With a chance of changing the government to one that promises more rigor, it seems that the deforesters are taking advantage of the possibility that the party's over,\" Barreto said.</p><p>Since Bolsonaro took office, in 2019, deforestation has been on the rise, as his administration has defanged environmental authorities and backed measures to loosen land protections, emboldening environmental offenders.</p><p>The far-right leader has repeatedly denied that fire is even increasing, despite official data from his government agency. On Thursday night, during the final presidential debate before the vote, he said that forest fires occur periodically in the Amazon, dismissed the criticism as a \"war of narratives,\" and said Brazil \"is an example to the world\" on conservation.</p><p>It was an answer to Simone Tebet, a senator who is close to agribusiness leaders and considered a moderate in the race. In one the of the few moments free of personal insults, she criticized Bolsonaro's environmental record in a segment related to climate change.</p><p>\"Your administration is the one that has set biomes, forests and my Pantanal wetlands on fire. Your administration favored miners and loggers, and protected them,\" she said. \"You, in this regard, were the worst president in Brazil's history.\"</p><p>During his campaign, da Silva promised to restore law enforcement and gained support from Indigenous and environmental leaders, such as former Environment Minister Marina Silva. She had broken publicly with the former president over his push to build hydroelectric dams and other development initiatives in the Amazon.</p><p>In announcing her support during a meeting with da Silva a few weeks ago, she called Bolsonaro a threat to Brazil's democracy. She said the country is facing a critical moment on issues ranging from the environment to the economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4991584</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66J0-5JP1-DYWP-806X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Woodward Communications, Inc.
