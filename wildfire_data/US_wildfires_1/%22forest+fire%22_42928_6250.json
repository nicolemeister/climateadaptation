We are One Earth, One Family, and we share One Future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. We, the Leaders of the G20, met in New Delhi on 910 September 2023, under the theme 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'. We meet at a defining moment in history where the decisions we make now will determine the future of our people and our planet. It is with the philosophy of living in harmony with our surrounding ecosystem that we commit to concrete actions to address global challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. G20 cooperation is essential in determining the course the world takes. Headwinds to global economic growth and stability persist. Years of cascading challenges and crises have reversed gains in the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to increase, with climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, drought, land degradation and desertification threatening lives and livelihoods. Rising commodity prices, including food and energy prices are contributing to cost of living pressures. Global challenges like poverty and inequality, climate change, pandemics and conflicts disproportionately affect women and children, and the most vulnerable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">See also</p><p>G20 New Delhi Leaders' Declaration</p><p>1.5 MB</p><p>pdf</p><p>4. Together we have an opportunity to build a better future. Just energy transitions can improve jobs and livelihoods, and strengthen economic resilience. We affirm that no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting for our planet. We will pursue development models that implement sustainable, inclusive and just transitions globally, while leaving no one behind.</p><p>5. As Leaders of G20, the premier global forum for international economic cooperation, we resolve to act in concrete ways through partnerships. We commit to:</p><p>a. Accelerate strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth.</p><p>b. Accelerate the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>c. Pursue low-GHG/low-carbon emissions, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable development pathways by championing an integrated and inclusive approach. We will urgently accelerate our actions to address development and climate challenges, promote Lifestyles for Sustainable Development (LiFE), and conserve biodiversity, forests and oceans.</p><p>d. Improve access to medical countermeasures and facilitate more supplies and production capacities in developing countries to prepare better for future health emergencies.</p><p>e. Promote resilient growth by urgently and effectively addressing debt vulnerabilities in developing countries.</p><p>f. Scale up financing from all sources for accelerating progress on SDGs.</p><p>g. Accelerate efforts and enhance resources towards achieving the Paris Agreement, including its temperature goal.</p><p>h. Pursue reforms for better, bigger and more effective Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to address global challenges to maximise developmental impact.</p><p>i. Improve access to digital services and digital public infrastructure, and leverage digital transformation opportunities to boost sustainable and inclusive growth.</p><p>j. Promote sustainable, quality, healthy, safe and gainful employment.</p><p>k. Close gender gaps and promote the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation of women in the economy as decision-makers.</p><p>l. Better integrate the perspectives of developing countries, including LDCs, LLDCs, and SIDS, into future G20 agenda and strengthen the voice of developing countries in global decision making.</p><p>6. Through these actions today, we are building towards a system that better empowers countries to address global challenges, is human-centric, and brings prosperity and well-being to humanity.</p><p>For the Planet, People, Peace and Prosperity</p><p>7. We note with deep concern the immense human suffering and the adverse impact of wars and conflicts around the world.</p><p>8. Concerning the war in Ukraine, while recalling the discussion in Bali, we reiterated our national positions and resolutions adopted at the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly (A/RES/ES-11/1 and A/RES/ES-11/6) and underscored that all states must act in a manner consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter in its entirety. In line with the UN Charter, all states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.</p><p>9. Reaffirming that the G20 is the premier forum for international economic cooperation, and recognizing that while the G20 is not the platform to resolve geopolitical and security issues, we acknowledge that these issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.</p><p>10. We highlighted the human suffering and negative added impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security, supply chains, macro-financial stability, inflation and growth, which has complicated the policy environment for countries, especially developing and least developed countries which are still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic disruption which has derailed progress towards the SDGs. There were different views and assessments of the situation.</p><p>11. We appreciate the efforts of Turkiye and UN-brokered Istanbul Agreements consisting of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on Promoting Russian Food Products and Fertilizers to the World Markets and the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Initiative), and call for their full, timely and effective implementation to ensure the immediate and unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This is necessary to meet the demand in developing and least developed countries, particularly those in Africa.</p><p>12. In this context, emphasizing the importance of sustaining food and energy security, we called for the cessation of military destruction or other attacks on relevant infrastructure. We also expressed deep concern about the adverse impact that conflicts have on the security of civilians thereby exacerbating existing socio-economic fragilities and vulnerabilities and hindering an effective humanitarian response.</p><p>13. We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty, international humanitarian law, and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, and efforts to address crises as well as diplomacy and dialogue are critical. We will unite in our endeavour to address the adverse impact of the war on the global economy and welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine that will uphold all the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter for the promotion of peaceful, friendly, and good neighbourly relations among nations in the spirit of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future'.</p><p>14. Today's era must not be of war.</p><p>A. Strong, Sustainable, Balanced, and Inclusive Growth</p><p>Global Economic Situation</p><p>15. Cascading crises have posed challenges to long-term growth. Facing an uneven recovery, and cognizant of the need to boost long-term growth, we will implement well- calibrated macroeconomic and structural policies. We will protect the vulnerable, through promoting equitable growth and enhancing macroeconomic and financial stability. Such an approach will help resolve the cost-of-living crisis and unlock strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.</p><p>16. Global economic growth is below its long-run average and remains uneven. The uncertainty around the outlook remains high. With notable tightening in global financial conditions, which could worsen debt vulnerabilities, persistent inflation and geoeconomic tensions, the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside. We, therefore, reiterate the need for well-calibrated monetary, fiscal, financial, and structural policies to promote growth, reduce inequalities and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation and support the progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We reaffirm that achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth (SSBIG) will require policymakers to stay agile and flexible in their policy response, as evidenced during the recent banking turbulence in a few advanced economies where expeditious action by relevant authorities helped to maintain financial stability and manage spillovers. We welcome the initial steps taken by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Standard Setting Bodies (SSBs) and certain jurisdictions to examine what lessons can be learned from this recent banking turbulence and encourage them to advance their ongoing work. We will use macroprudential policies, where required, to safeguard against downside risks. Central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability in line with their respective mandates. They will ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and will clearly communicate policy stances to help limit negative cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to maintaining policy credibility. We will prioritise temporary and targeted fiscal measures to protect the poor and the most vulnerable, while maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. Ensuring the overall coherence of the monetary and fiscal stances remains important. We recognise the importance of supply-side policies, especially policies that increase labour supply and enhance productivity to boost growth and alleviate price pressures. We reaffirm the April 2021 exchange rate commitment made by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.</p><p>17. We recognise the critical role of private enterprise in accelerating growth and driving sustainable economic transformations. To this end, we resolve to work with private sector to:</p><p>i. Create inclusive, sustainable, and resilient global value chains, and support developing countries to move up the value chain.</p><p>ii. Facilitate investments including Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) towards sustainable business models.</p><p>iii. Devise pipelines of investible projects in developing countries, by leveraging expertise of MDBs to mobilise investments.</p><p>iv. Promote the ease and reduce the cost of doing business.</p><p>18. We recognise that start-ups and MSMEs are natural engines of growth. They are key to socio-economic transformation by driving innovation and creating employment. We welcome the establishment of the Start-up 20 Engagement Group during India's G20 Presidency and its continuation.</p><p>Unlocking Trade for Growth</p><p>19. We reaffirm that a rules-based, non-discriminatory, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system, with WTO at its core, is indispensable. We will support policies that enable trade and investment to serve as an engine of growth and prosperity for all. Today, we:</p><p>i. Renew our commitment to ensure a level-playing field and fair competition by discouraging protectionism and market distorting practices, to foster a favourable trade and investment environment for all. We reiterate the need to pursue WTO reform to improve all its functions through an inclusive member-driven process, and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and wellfunctioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. We commit to work constructively to ensure positive outcomes at the WTO's Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13).</p><p>ii. Recognise challenges MSMEs, particularly in developing countries, face with respect to access to information and thus, welcome Jaipur Call for Action for enhancing MSMEs' access to information to promote the integration of MSMEs into international trade.</p><p>iii. Welcome the adoption of G20 Generic Framework for Mapping Global Value Chains (GVC) to help members identify risks and build resilience.</p><p>iv. Welcome the High-Level Principles on Digitalization of Trade Documents and will make efforts to encourage implementation, and encourage other countries to consider these principles.</p><p>v. Ensure that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive, consistent with WTO and multilateral environmental agreements.</p><p>vi. Recognize the importance of WTO's 'Aid for Trade' initiative to enable developing countries, notably LDCs to effectively participate in global trade, including through enhanced local value creation. We welcome all efforts to mobilize necessary resources in this regard.</p><p>Preparing for the Future of Work</p><p>20. We commit to addressing skill gaps, promoting decent work and ensuring inclusive social protection policies for all. Towards this aim, we:</p><p>i. Recognise that well-integrated and adequately skilled workers benefit origin and destination countries alike and commit to working towards ensuring well-managed, regular and skills-based migration pathways.</p><p>ii. Welcome efforts to map global skill gaps and the development of the G20 policy priorities to address skill gaps globally, including through further strengthening our national statistical data, extending the coverage of the ILO and OECD Skills for Jobs Databases to G20 countries, as appropriate. We commit to effectively addressing global skills for sustainable and inclusive economic development.</p><p>iii. Commit to consider the development of an international reference classification of occupations by skill and qualification requirements to facilitate cross-country comparability and mutual recognition of skills and qualifications.</p><p>iv. Welcome the comprehensive toolkit with adaptable frameworks for designing and introducing digital upskilling and reskilling programmes.</p><p>v. Aim to achieve sustainably financed universal social protection coverage and consider portability of social security benefits through bilateral and multilateral agreements.</p><p>vi. Support progress on the implementation of the UN Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions.</p><p>vii. Acknowledge the economic significance and societal value of the cultural and creative sector to support inclusive growth, sustainable development and decent work.</p><p>viii. Ensure adequate social protection and decent working conditions for gig and platform workers.</p><p>ix. Will increase our efforts for the elimination of child labour and forced labour along global value chains.</p><p>Advancing Financial Inclusion</p><p>21. We welcome the 2023 Update to Leaders on Progress towards the G20 Remittance Target and endorse the Regulatory Toolkit for Enhanced Digital Financial Inclusion of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). We endorse the voluntary and nonbinding G20 Policy Recommendations for Advancing Financial Inclusion and Productivity Gains through Digital Public Infrastructure. We take note of the significant role of digital public infrastructure in helping to advance financial inclusion in support of inclusive growth and sustainable development. We also encourage the continuous development and responsible use of technological innovations including innovative payment systems, to achieve financial inclusion of the last mile and progress towards reducing the cost of remittances. We also support continuous efforts to strengthen digital financial literacy and consumer protection. We endorse the G20 2023 Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP), which provides an action oriented and forward-looking roadmap for rapidly accelerating the financial inclusion of individuals and MSMEs, particularly vulnerable and underserved groups in the G20 countries and beyond.</p><p>Fighting Corruption</p><p>22. We reaffirm our commitment to zero tolerance for corruption.</p><p>i. We endorse the three G20 High-Level Principles on:</p><p>1) Strengthening Law Enforcement related International Cooperation and Information Sharing for Combating Corruption</p><p>2) Strengthening Asset Recovery Mechanisms for Combating Corruption</p><p>3) Promoting Integrity and Effectiveness of Public Bodies and Authorities responsible for Preventing and Combating Corruption</p><p>ii. Reaffirm our support to enhance global efforts to seize, confiscate and return criminal proceeds to victims and states, in line with international obligations and domestic legal frameworks, including through support to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and operationalization of the GlobE Network.</p><p>iii. Reaffirm our commitment to demonstrate and continue concrete efforts and share information on our actions towards criminalizing foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation, in line with Article 16 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and welcome Anti-Corruption Working Group's efforts in striving towards this goal. We look forward to enlarging participation to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as appropriate.</p><p>B. Accelerating Progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</p><p>23. At the midway point to 2030, the global progress on SDGs is off-track with only 12 percent of the targets on track. During this Decade of Action, we will leverage the G20's convening power and its collective resolve to fully and effectively implement the 2030 Agenda and accelerate progress toward the SDGs, in a timely manner, to shape the world we want to see for our future generations.</p><p>Recommitting to Achieving SDGs</p><p>24. To accelerate progress on SDGs, we commit to taking collective action for effective and timely implementation of the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the SDGs, including its High-Level Principles. We will ensure that no one is left behind. We commend the efforts of the Indian Presidency to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Recognise the role of digital transformation, AI, data advances, and the need to address digital divides. We endorse the G20 Principles on Harnessing Data for Development (D4D) and welcome the decision to launch Data for Development Capacity Building Initiative, and other existing initiatives.</p><p>ii. We reaffirm our commitment towards the mobilisation of affordable, adequate and accessible financing from all sources to support developing countries in their domestic efforts to address bottlenecks for implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We call upon developed countries to fully deliver on their respective ODA commitments that complements and encourages development financing from all other sources, including public and private, domestic and international, in a timely manner, and contribute to addressing the financing needs of developing countries.</p><p>iii. Highlight the crucial role of tourism and culture as a means for sustainable socioeconomic development and economic prosperity, and take note of the Goa Roadmap for Tourism as one of the vehicles for achieving the SDGs.</p><p>iv. Commit to enhancing G20 cooperation and partnerships to address challenges being faced in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We welcome ongoing efforts at the UN, including the Secretary General's efforts to address the SDG financing gap through an SDG stimulus, and will provide full support to the United Nations 2023 SDG Summit, the United Nations Summit of the Future, and other relevant processes.</p><p>25. We reiterate our commitment to take action to scale up sustainable finance. In line with the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, we welcome the analytical framework for SDG-aligned finance and voluntary recommendations for scaling up adoption of social impact investment instruments and improving nature-related data and reporting, informed by the stocktaking analyses, considering country circumstances.</p><p>Eliminating Hunger and Malnutrition</p><p>26. We commit to enhance global food security and nutrition for all in line with the G20 Deccan High-Level Principles on Food Security and Nutrition 2023. To achieve this, we:</p><p>i. We encourage efforts to strengthen research cooperation on climate-resilient and nutritious grains such as millets, quinoa, sorghum, and other traditional crops including rice, wheat and maize. We welcome the outcomes from the G20 members engagement in the 12th G20 Meeting of Agriculture Chief Scientists (MACS).</p><p>ii. Emphasize the importance of increasing access to, availability, and efficient use of fertilizer and agricultural inputs, including through strengthening local fertilizer production, and to improve soil health.</p><p>iii. Commit to accelerating innovations and investment focused on increasing agricultural productivity, reducing food loss and waste across the value chain, and improving marketing and storage, to build more sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture and food systems.</p><p>iv. Commit to support developing countries' efforts and capacities to address their food security challenges, and work together to enable access to affordable, safe, nutritious and healthy diets, and to foster the progressive realization of the right to adequate food.</p><p>v. Commit to facilitate open, fair, predictable, and rules-based agriculture, food and fertilizer trade, not impose export prohibitions or restrictions and reduce market distortions, in accordance with relevant WTO rules.</p><p>vi. Commit to strengthening the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) and the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM), for greater transparency to avoid food price volatility, supporting AMIS's work on fertilizers, its expansion to include vegetable oils, and for enhancing collaboration with early warning systems.</p><p>Macroeconomic impacts of food and energy insecurity</p><p>27. While global food and energy prices have fallen from their peak levels, the potential for high levels of volatility in food and energy markets remains, given the uncertainties in the global economy. In this context, we take note of the G20 Report on Macroeconomic Impacts of Food and Energy Insecurity and their Implications for the Global Economy. We look forward to an ambitious replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) resources at the end of the year by IFAD members to support IFAD's fight against food insecurity.</p><p>Strengthening Global Health and Implementing One Health Approach</p><p>28. We remain committed to strengthening the global health architecture, with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, and building more resilient, equitable, sustainable, and inclusive health systems to achieve Universal Health Coverage, implement One Health approach, enhance pandemic preparedness and strengthen existing infectious diseases surveillance systems. To achieve this, we will:</p><p>i. Focus on strengthening primary health care and health workforce and improving essential health services and health systems to better than pre-pandemic levels, ideally within the next 23 years, as well as continue progress towards polio eradication and ending ongoing epidemics including AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis and water-borne and other communicable diseases, also recognising the importance of research on long COVID.</p><p>ii. Promote the One Health-based approach driven by the Quadripartite's One Health Joint Plan of Action (20222026).</p><p>iii. Enhance the resilience of health systems and support development of climate- resilient and low-carbon health systems in collaboration with MDBs, and support the work of the WHO-led Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH).</p><p>iv. Implement and prioritise tackling Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) following the One Health approach, including through research and development, infection prevention and control, as well as antimicrobial stewardship efforts within respective national action plans through AMR and antimicrobial consumption surveillance.</p><p>v. Facilitate equitable access to safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other medical countermeasures, especially in Low-and Middle-income Countries (LMICs), LDCs and SIDS.</p><p>vi. Look forward to a successful outcome of the ongoing negotiations at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) for an ambitious, legally binding WHO convention, agreement or other international instruments on pandemic PPR (WHO CA+) by May 2024, as well as amendments to better implement the International Health Regulations (2005).</p><p>vii. Recognize the potential role of evidence-based Traditional and Complementary Medicine in health, and take note of international efforts in this direction, including WHO's global and collaborating centres, and clinical trial registries.</p><p>viii. Support the WHO-led inclusive consultative process for the development of an interim medical countermeasures coordination mechanism, with effective participation of LMICs and other developing countries, considering a network of networks approach, leveraging local and regional RandD and manufacturing capacities, and strengthening last mile delivery. This may be adapted in alignment with the WHO CA+.</p><p>ix. Promote and improve access to mental health services and psychosocial support in an inclusive manner.</p><p>x. While highlighting the public health dimension of the world drug problem, call for strong international counter-narcotics cooperation, free of unnecessary restrictions, including information sharing and capacity building to disrupt production and proliferation of illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, and precursor chemicals at their origin, in transit and at destination points.</p><p>Finance-Health Collaboration</p><p>29. We remain committed to strengthening the global health architecture for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) through enhanced collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries under the Joint Finance and Health Task Force (JFHTF). Under the JFHTF, we welcome the participation of invited key regional organisations in the Task Force meetings as they enhance the voice of low-income countries. We welcome the discussion on the Framework on Economic Vulnerabilities and Risks (FEVR) and the initial Report for Economic Vulnerabilities and Risks arising from pandemics, created through collaboration between World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank, IMF, and European Investment Bank (EIB). We call on the Task Force to continue refining this Framework over its multi-year work plan in order to regularly assess economic vulnerabilities and risks due to evolving pandemic threats, taking into account country-specific circumstances. We welcome the Report on Best Practices from Finance Health Institutional Arrangements during Covid-19 that will contribute towards joint finance-health sector readiness to support our response to future pandemics. We welcome the Report on Mapping Pandemic Response Financing Options and Gaps developed by the WHO and World Bank and look forward to further deliberations on how financing mechanisms could be optimized, better coordinated and, when necessary, suitably enhanced to deploy the necessary financing quickly and efficiently, duly considering discussions in other global forums. We welcome the conclusion of the first call for proposals by the Pandemic Fund and look forward to the second Call for Proposals by the end of 2023, based on lessons learned from the first Call for Proposals. We highlight the importance of securing new donors and coinvestment. We ask the Task Force to report back to Finance and Health Ministers in 2024 on its progress.</p><p>Delivering Quality Education</p><p>30. We are committed to inclusive, equitable, high-quality education and skills training for all, including for those in vulnerable situations. We recognize the importance of investment in supporting human capital development. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Recognize the importance of foundational learning (literacy, numeracy, and socio- emotional skills) as the primary building block for education and employment.</p><p>ii. Reiterate our commitment to harness digital technologies to overcome the digital divides for all learners.</p><p>iii. Extend support to educational institutions and teachers to enable them to keep pace with emerging trends and technological advances including AI.</p><p>iv. Emphasize expanding access to high-quality Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET).</p><p>v. Reaffirm our commitment to promote open, equitable and secure scientific collaboration and encourage mobility of students, scholars, researchers, and scientists across research and higher education institutions.</p><p>vi. Emphasize the importance of enabling life-long learning focused on skilling, reskilling, and upskilling especially for vulnerable groups.</p><p>Culture as a Transformative Driver of SDGs</p><p>31. We call for the full recognition and protection of culture with its intrinsic value as a transformative driver and an enabler for the achievement of the SDGs and advance the inclusion of culture as a standalone goal in future discussions on a possible post-2030 development agenda. We reiterate our commitment to strengthen our fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property at national, regional or international levels to enable its return and restitution to their countries and communities of origin as relevant, and call for sustained dialogue and action in that endeavour, with a view to strengthen cultural diplomacy and intercultural exchanges, consistent with national law and relevant UNESCO Conventions. We encourage the international community to protect the living cultural heritage, including the intellectual property, notably with regard to the impact of the over commercialization and misappropriation of such living heritage on the sustainability and on the livelihoods of practitioners and community bearers as well as Indigenous Peoples.</p><p>C. Green Development Pact for a Sustainable Future</p><p>32. Recognising that the prosperity and well-being of present and future generations depends on our current development and other policy choices and actions, we resolve to pursue environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development in an integrated, holistic and balanced manner.</p><p>33. We commit to urgently accelerate our actions to address environmental crises and challenges including climate change. We recognize that the impacts of climate change are being experienced worldwide, particularly by the poorest and the most vulnerable, including in LDCs and SIDS. Mindful of our leadership role, we reaffirm our steadfast commitments, in pursuit of the objective of UNFCCC, to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goal, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. We note with concern that global ambition and implementation to address climate change remain insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above preindustrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. We highlight the importance of ambitious action on all pillars of the Paris Agreement, taking into account the best available science. Noting the IPCC assessments, that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5C compared with 2C, we reiterate our resolve to pursue further efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long term ambition with short and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology and sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development. We recognize that limiting global warming to 1.5C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global GHG emissions of 43% by 2030 relative to the 2019 levels. We also take note of the finding of the IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report, based on global modelled pathways and assumptions, stating that \"Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2C and assume immediate action.\" This does not imply peaking in all countries within this timeframe; timeframes for peaking may be shaped by sustainable development, poverty eradication needs, equity, and in line with different national circumstances. We further recognize that technology development and transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, capacity building and financing can support countries in this regard.</p><p>34. We urge all countries that have not yet aligned their NDCs with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their NDCs, as necessary, by the end of 2023, taking into account different national circumstances, and we welcome those who have already done so. We recall the nationally determined nature of NDCs and Article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement, which provides that \"Developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.\" In this context, we commend those countries whose NDCs include economy-wide targets covering all GHGs, and others are encouraged to include such economy-wide targets in their upcoming NDC cycle(s), in the light of different national circumstances. We will contribute to a successful conclusion of the first global stocktake at COP28 in Dubai, that drives enhanced climate action across mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation and support. We reiterate our commitment to achieve global net zero GHG emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century, while taking into account the latest scientific developments and in line with different national circumstances, taking into account different approaches including the Circular Carbon Economy, socioeconomic, technological, and market development, and promoting the most efficient solutions.</p><p>Macroeconomic risks stemming from climate change and transition pathways</p><p>35. The macroeconomic costs of the physical impacts of climate change are significant both at aggregate and country levels, and the cost of inaction substantially outweighs that of orderly and just transitions. We recognise the importance of international dialogue and cooperation, including in the areas of finance and technology, and timely policy action consistent with country-specific circumstances. It is also critical to assess and account for the short, medium and long-term macroeconomic impact of both the physical impact of climate change and transition policies, including on growth, inflation, and unemployment. We endorse the G20 Report on Macroeconomic Risks Stemming from Climate Change and Transition Pathways. Building on analysis in this Report, we will consider further work on the macroeconomic implications, as appropriate, particularly as relevant for fiscal and monetary policies, drawing on the inputs from a diverse set of stakeholders.</p><p>Mainstreaming Lifestyles for Sustainable Development (LiFE)</p><p>36. Based on the G20 High-Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development, we commit to robust collective actions that will enable the world to embrace sustainable production and consumption patterns and mainstream Lifestyles for Sustainable Development. Relevant studies on it show that it could contribute to significant emission reduction by 2030 for a global net-zero future. We support the creation of an enabling policy environment to promote sustainable lifestyles for climate action. Towards this end, we:</p><p>i. Commit to implement the G20 High-Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development.</p><p>ii. Support the implementation of the High-Level Principles (HLPs) through international cooperation, financial support, and development, deployment and dissemination of technology. We encourage International Organizations to incorporate the HLPs into their programs, as appropriate.</p><p>iii. Note the launch of \"Travel for LiFE\" and support the development of smart destinations that are responsible and sustainable.</p><p>Designing a Circular Economy World</p><p>37. In order to endeavour to decouple our economic growth from environmental degradation and enhance sustainable consumption and production, including primary resource consumption while supporting economic growth, we acknowledge the critical role played by circular economy, extended producer responsibility and resource efficiency in achieving sustainable development. We thank the Indian presidency in launching Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition (RECEIC). We commit to enhance environmentally sound waste management, substantially reduce waste generation by 2030, and highlight the importance of zero waste initiatives.</p><p>Implementing Clean, Sustainable, Just, Affordable and Inclusive Energy Transitions</p><p>38. We commit to accelerating clean, sustainable, just, affordable and inclusive energy transitions following various pathways, as a means of enabling strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth and achieve our climate objectives. We recognise the needs, vulnerabilities, priorities and different national circumstances of developing countries. We support strong international and national enabling environments to foster innovation, voluntary and mutually agreed technology transfer, and access to low-cost financing. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Emphasise the importance of maintaining uninterrupted flows of energy from various sources, suppliers and routes, exploring paths of enhanced energy security and market stability, including through inclusive investments to meet the growing energy demand, in line with our sustainable development and climate goals, while promoting open, competitive, non-discriminatory and free international energy markets.</p><p>ii. Recognizing that developing countries need to be supported in their transitions to low carbon/emissions, we will work towards facilitating low-cost financing for them.</p><p>iii. Support the acceleration of production, utilization, as well as the development of transparent and resilient global markets for hydrogen produced from zero and low-emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia, by developing voluntary and mutually agreed harmonising standards as well as mutually recognised and inter-operable certification schemes. To realise this, we affirm the 'G20 High Level Voluntary Principles on Hydrogen', to build a sustainable and equitable global hydrogen ecosystem that benefits all nations. We take note of the Presidency's initiative to establish the Green Hydrogen Innovation Centre steered by the International Solar Alliance (ISA).</p><p>iv. Will work towards facilitating access to low-cost financing for developing countries, for existing as well as new and emerging clean and sustainable energy technologies and for supporting the energy transitions. We note the report on \"Low-cost Financing for the Energy Transitions\" prepared under the Indian Presidency and its estimation that the world needs an annual investment of over USD 4 trillion, with a high share of renewable energy in the primary energy mix.</p><p>v. Will pursue and encourage efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally through existing targets and policies, as well as demonstrate similar ambition with respect to other zero and low-emission technologies, including abatement and removal technologies, in line with national circumstances by 2030. We also note the 'Voluntary Action Plan for Promoting Renewable Energy to Accelerate Universal Energy Access'.</p><p>vi. Pledge to advance cooperation initiatives to develop, demonstrate and deploy clean and sustainable energy technologies and solutions and other efforts for innovation.</p><p>vii. Take note of the 'Voluntary Action Plan on Doubling the Rate of Energy Efficiency Improvement by 2030'.</p><p>viii. Recognize the importance of sustainable biofuels in our zero and low- emission development strategies, and note the setting up of a Global Biofuels Alliance.</p><p>ix. Support reliable, diversified, sustainable and responsible supply chains for energy transitions, including for critical minerals and materials beneficiated at source, semiconductors and technologies. We take note of the Presidency's \"Voluntary High- Level Principles for Collaboration on Critical Minerals for Energy Transitions\".</p><p>x. For countries that opt to use civil nuclear energy, will collaborate on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, in research, innovation, development and deployment of civil nuclear technologies including advanced and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), in accordance with national legislations. These countries will promote responsible nuclear decommissioning, radioactive waste and spent fuel management and mobilizing investments, and share knowledge and best practices, through strengthening international cooperation to promote nuclear safety globally.</p><p>xi. Recognize the role of grid interconnections, resilient energy infrastructure and regional/cross-border power systems integration, where applicable in enhancing energy security, fostering economic growth and facilitating universal energy access for all.</p><p>xii. Will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalise, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.</p><p>xiii. Recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards just transitions.</p><p>Delivering on Climate and Sustainable Finance</p><p>39. We welcome the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) recommendations on the mechanisms to support the timely and adequate mobilisation of resources for climate finance while ensuring support for transition activities in line with country circumstances. We also recognise the significant role of public finance as an important enabler of climate actions, such as leveraging much-needed private finance through blended financial instruments, mechanisms and risk-sharing facilities to address both adaptation and mitigation efforts in a balanced manner for reaching ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), carbon neutrality and net-zero considering different national circumstances. We welcome the SFWG recommendations for scaling up blended finance and risk-sharing facilities, including the enhanced role of MDBs in mobilizing climate finance. We underscore the importance of maximizing the effect of concessional resources, such as those of the multilateral climate funds, to support developing countries' implementation of the Paris Agreement and call for an ambitious second replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund for its upcoming 20242027 programming period We will undertake work to facilitate access to multilateral climate funds and enhance their leverage and ability to mobilize private capital. Recognizing the importance of supporting the commercialization of early-stage technologies that avoid, abate and remove greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate adaptation, we note the recommendations on financial solutions, policies, and incentives to encourage greater private flows for the rapid development, demonstration, and deployment of green and low-emission technologies. We reiterate the importance of a policy mix consisting of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms, including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives toward carbon neutrality and net zero.</p><p>40. We endorse the multi-year G20 Technical Assistance Action Plan (TAAP) and the voluntary recommendations made to overcome data-related barriers to climate investments. We encourage the implementation of TAAP by relevant jurisdictions and stakeholders in line with the national circumstances. We look forward to reporting on the progress made in the implementation of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which is voluntary and flexible in nature, and call for further efforts to advance the Roadmap's recommended actions that will scale up sustainable finance, including, among others, the implementation of the Transition Finance Framework. We look forward to the 2023 G20 Sustainable Finance Report. We welcome the finalization of International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in June 2023, which provide the mechanisms that address proportionality and promote interoperability. It is important that flexibility, to take into account country-specific circumstances, is preserved in the implementation of those standards. When put into practice as above, those standards will help support globally comparable and reliable disclosures.</p><p>41. We recognise the need for increased global investments to meet our climate goals of the Paris Agreement, and to rapidly and substantially scale up investment and climate finance from billions to trillions of dollars globally from all sources. In this regard, it is essential to align all relevant financial flows with these objectives while scaling up finance, capacity building and technology transfer on voluntary and mutually agreed terms, taking into account the priorities and needs of developing countries. To achieve this, we:</p><p>i. Note the need of USD 5.85.9 trillion in the pre-2030 period required for developing countries, in particular for their needs to implement their NDCs, as well as the need of USD 4 trillion per year for clean energy technologies by 2030 to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>ii. We recall and reaffirm the commitment made in 2010 by the developed countries to the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion climate finance per year by 2020, and annually through 2025, to address the needs of the developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency in implementation. Developed country contributors expect this goal to be met for the first time in 2023.</p><p>iii. We will work to successfully implement the decision at COP27 on funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including establishing a fund. We will support the Transitional Committee established in this regard, and look forward to its recommendations on operationalization of the new funding arrangements including a fund at COP28.</p><p>iv. Call on Parties to set an ambitious, transparent and trackable New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of climate finance in 2024, from a floor of USD 100 billion a year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries in fulfilling the objective of the UNFCCC and implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>v. Recalling para 18 of the Glasgow Climate Pact, we urge the developed countries to fulfil their commitment to at least double their collective provision of adaptation finance from 2019 levels by 2025, in the context of achieving scaled up financial resources.</p><p>vi. Call on all relevant financial institutions, such as MDBs and multilateral funds to further strengthen their efforts including by setting ambitious adaptation finance targets and announcing, where appropriate, revised and enhanced 2025 projections.</p><p>vii. Acknowledge the vital role of private climate finance in supplementing public climate finance and encourage the development of financing mechanisms such as blended finance, de-risking instruments and green bonds for projects in developing countries.</p><p>Conserving, Protecting, Sustainably Using and Restoring Ecosystems</p><p>42. We emphasize the importance of healthy ecosystems in addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, drought, land degradation, pollution, food insecurity and water scarcity. We commit to restoring by 2030 at least 30% of all degraded ecosystems and scaling up efforts to achieve land degradation neutrality. To achieve this, we:</p><p>i. Commit to the swift, full and effective implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), and encourage others to do the same, and encourage actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. We also call for enhanced financial resources from all sources. To this end, we welcome the recent establishment of the Global Biodiversity Framework Fund within the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p><p>ii. Support the G20 ambition to reduce land degradation by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis, as committed under the G20 Global Land Initiative (GLI) and note the discussions on the Gandhinagar Implementation Roadmap and the Gandhinagar Information Platform.</p><p>iii. Recognize that forests provide crucial ecosystem services, as well as for climate purposes acting as sinks, at the global and local levels for the environment, climate and people. We will scale up efforts to protect, conserve and sustainably manage forests and combat deforestation, in line with internationally agreed timelines, highlighting the contributions of these actions for sustainable development and taking into account the social and economic challenges of local communities and indigenous peoples. In the context of forests, we will avoid discriminatory green economic policies, consistent with WTO rules and multilateral environmental agreements. We are committed to mobilizing new and additional finance for forests from all sources, including concessional and innovative financing, in particular for developing countries. We commit to prevention and mitigation of wildfires and remediation of mining-degraded lands.</p><p>iv. Call for enhancing global cooperation and sharing of best practices on water, and welcome the deliberations at the UN 2023 Water Conference and G20 Dialogue on Water.</p><p>Harnessing and Preserving the Ocean-based Economy</p><p>43. We commit to conserving, protecting, restoring and sustainably using the world's ocean, marine ecosystems, and look forward to make progress and in this regard, contribute to the 2025 UN Ocean Conference. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Welcome the Chennai High-Level Principles for a Sustainable and Resilient Blue/Ocean-based Economy.</p><p>ii. Note the adoption of the new international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine Biological diversity of areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) and call on all countries for its early entry into force and implementation.</p><p>iii. Support the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), within the Antarctic Treaty system, to establish a representative system of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the CCAMLR Convention area based on the best available scientific evidence.</p><p>iv. Reiterate our commitment to ending illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, as well as destructive fishing methods in accordance with international law.</p><p>v. Support the role of Ocean 20 Dialogue in making progress to achieve this agenda.</p><p>Ending Plastic Pollution</p><p>44. We are determined to end plastic pollution. In this context, we welcome the resolution UNEP/EA.5/Res.14 which established an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including the marine environment, with the ambition of completing its work by the end of 2024. We will also build on the G20 Marine Litter Action Plan as elucidated in the Osaka Blue Ocean Vision.</p><p>Financing Cities of Tomorrow</p><p>45. We emphasise the need for enhanced mobilisation of finances and efficient use of existing resources in our efforts to make the cities of tomorrow inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. To this effect, we endorse the G20 Principles for Financing Cities of Tomorrow, which are voluntary and non-binding in nature and the G20/OECD Report on Financing Cities of Tomorrow, which provides a financing strategy as well as presents a compendium of innovative urban planning and financing models. We encourage stakeholders, including the Development Financial Institutions and the MDBs, to explore the potential of drawing upon these principles in their planning and financing of urban infrastructure wherever applicable and share experiences from early pilot cases. We note the progress in outlining the enablers of inclusive cities. We also note the customisable G20/ADB Framework on Capacity Building of Urban Administration to guide local governments in assessing and enhancing their overall institutional capacity for the effective delivery of public services. We note the ongoing pilot application of the voluntary and non-binding Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Indicators and look forward to further discussion on their application considering country circumstances.</p><p>Reducing Disaster Risk and Building Resilient Infrastructure</p><p>46. This year, the G20 Presidency has catalysed efforts on disaster risk reduction in the G20 through institutionalization of the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Working Group as noted by UNGA res. 77/289. We reaffirm the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) and recognize the need for accelerating its full implementation. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Urge for accelerating progress on Early Warning and Early Action through strengthening national and local capacities, innovative financing tools, private sector investment, and knowledge sharing.</p><p>ii. Continue to support augmentation of capabilities of all countries, including emerging economies, in particular developing countries, LDCs and SIDS, for promoting disaster and climate resilience of infrastructure systems. We welcome the Global Platform for DRR and take note of initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) in furtherance of such collaboration and sharing.</p><p>iii. Promote mutual learning of recovery experiences applying all the principles of Sendai Framework.</p><p>D. Multilateral Institutions for the 21st Century</p><p>Reinvigorating Multilateralism</p><p>47. The global order has undergone dramatic changes since the Second World War due to economic growth and prosperity, decolonization, demographic dividends, technological achievements, emergence of new economic powers and deeper international cooperation. The United Nations must be responsive to the entire membership, faithful to its founding purposes and principles of its Charter and adapted to carrying out its mandate. In this context, we recall the Declaration on the Commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations (UNGA 75/1) which reaffirmed that our challenges are inter-connected and can only be addressed through reinvigorated multilateralism, reforms and international cooperation. The need for revitalized multilateralism to adequately address contemporary global challenges of the 21st Century, and to make global governance more representative, effective, transparent and accountable, has been voiced at multiple fora. In this context, a more inclusive and reinvigorated multilateralism and reform aimed at implementing the 2030 agenda is essential.</p><p>Reforming International Financial Institutions</p><p>48. The 21st century also requires an international development finance system that is fit for purpose, including for the scale of need and depth of the shocks facing developing countries, in particular the poorest and most vulnerable. We are working to deliver better, bigger and more effective MDBs by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility, and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximise development impact. Stronger MDBs will be important to our efforts to mobilize financing from all sources for a quantum jump from billions to trillions of dollars for development. We underscore the need for enhancing representation and voice of developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions. The international finance system must deliver significantly more financing to help developing countries and EMEs to fight poverty, tackle global challenges and maximise development impact.</p><p>49. We remain committed to pursuing ambitious efforts to evolve and strengthen MDBs to address the global challenges of the 21st century with a continued focus on addressing the development needs of low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>50. We endorse the G20 Roadmap for Implementing the Recommendations of the G20 Independent Review of MDBs Capital Adequacy Frameworks (CAFs) and call for its ambitious implementation, within MDBs' own governance frameworks while safeguarding their long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. We also call for a regular review of the progress of implementation on a rolling basis including through engaging with MDBs, subject experts and shareholders. We commend the MDBs for their progress in implementing the CAF recommendations, especially with respect to adapting definitions of risk appetite and financial innovation. We appreciate the ongoing collaboration among MDBs on the timely release of Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) data and the launch of GEMs 2.0 as a stand-alone entity by early 2024. Going forward, we also encourage MDBs to collaborate in areas such as hybrid capital, callable capital, and guarantees. We appreciate the enhanced dialogue between the MDBs, Credit Rating Agencies and shareholders and encourage continued transparency in the exchange of information and rating methodologies. We take note that initial CAF measures, including those under implementation and consideration, could potentially yield additional lending headroom of approximately USD 200 billion over the next decade, as estimated in the G20 CAF Roadmap. While these are encouraging first steps, we will need to give an additional push for continued and further impetus on CAF implementation.</p><p>51. Furthermore, we call on the MDBs to undertake comprehensive efforts to evolve their vision, incentive structures, operational approaches and financial capacities so that they are better equipped to maximize their impact in addressing a wide range of global challenges while being consistent with their mandate and commitment to accelerate progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We welcome the World Bank's progress on their Evolution Roadmap and look forward to further steps by the IMF/WBG Annual Meetings in Marrakesh and beyond. Recognising the urgent need to strengthen and evolve the MDB ecosystem for the 21st century, we appreciate the efforts of the G20 Independent Expert Group on Strengthening MDBs in preparing Volume 1 of the Report and look forward to its examination in conjunction with Volume 2 expected in October 2023. We take note of Volume 1's recommendations and the MDBs may choose to discuss these recommendations as relevant and appropriate, within their governance frameworks, in due course, with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of MDBs. We support the upcoming G20 High-Level Seminar, on the sidelines of the Fourth G20 FMCBG in October 2023 on strengthening the financial capacity of MDBs. Scaling up investment to meet development needs and global challenges requires a big push on investments and, in this context, we ask the IMF and the World Bank, in coordination with other relevant international institutions, to support efforts at enhancing domestic resource mobilisation in EMDEs. We call on the MDBs to also leverage private capital through innovative financing models and new partnerships to maximise their development impact. Recognizing other multilateral efforts, we take note of the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact.</p><p>52. Recognizing the imperative of achieving the SDGs, we will collectively mobilize more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low and middle-income countries that need help in addressing global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. Therefore, we are exploring options that will deliver a powerful boost to IBRD headroom, reduce the cost of investments addressing global challenges, and increase the capacity of the IDA crisis response window. We also look forward to an ambitious IDA21 replenishment to increase IDA financing capacity. We acknowledge the concluding report on the 2020 Shareholding Review of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and look forward to the 2025 Shareholding Review.</p><p>53. We reiterate our commitment to a strong, quota-based, and adequately resourced IMF at the centre of the global financial safety net. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ), including a new quota formula as a guide, and ensure the primary role of quotas in iMf resources, to be concluded by December 15, 2023. In this context, we support at least maintaining the IMF's current resource envelope. We welcome the landmark achievement of the global ambition of USD 100 billion of voluntary contributions (in SDRs or equivalent) and USD 2.6 billion of grants in pledges for countries most in need and call for the swift delivery of pending pledges. We welcome the progress achieved under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) and Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We call for further voluntary subsidy and loan pledges to the PRGT and will continue to monitor the effectiveness of RST supported programs. We look forward to the preliminary analysis by the IMF of the range of options to put the PRGT on a sustainable footing with a view to meeting the growing needs of low-income countries in the coming years. The G20 reiterates its continued support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa. We look forward to further progress on the exploration of viable options for voluntary channelling of SDRs through MDBs, while respecting relevant legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve asset character and status of SDR. We look forward to review of precautionary arrangements and take note of the discussions held on the IMF surcharge policy.</p><p>Managing Global Debt Vulnerabilities</p><p>54. We re-emphasise the importance of addressing debt vulnerabilities in low and middleincome countries in an effective, comprehensive and systematic manner. We continue to stand by all the commitments made in the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, including those in the second and final paragraphs, as agreed on November 13, 2020, and step up the implementation of the Common Framework in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. To this end, we call for continued discussion on policy-related issues linked to the implementation of the Common Framework for making appropriate recommendations. We welcome the recent agreement between the Government of Zambia and the official creditor committee on debt treatment and look forward to a swift resolution. We welcome the formation of the official creditor committee for Ghana and look forward to an agreement on a debt treatment as soon as possible. We also call for a swift conclusion of the debt treatment for Ethiopia. Beyond the Common Framework, we welcome all efforts for timely resolution of the debt situation of Sri Lanka, including the formation of the official creditor committee, and we call for the resolution as soon as possible. We encourage the efforts of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) participants to strengthen communication and foster a common understanding among key stakeholders, both within and outside the Common Framework, for facilitating effective debt treatments. We welcome joint efforts by all stakeholders, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We note the results of the voluntary stocktaking exercise of data sharing with International Financial Institutions. We welcome the efforts of private sector lenders who have already contributed data to the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal and continue to encourage others to also contribute on a voluntary basis.</p><p>E. Technological Transformation and Digital Public Infrastructure</p><p>55. Technology can enable rapid transformations for bridging the existing digital divides and accelerate progress for inclusive and sustainable development. Digital public infrastructure (DPI), as an evolving concept and as a set of shared digital systems, built and leveraged by both the public and private sectors, based on secure and resilient infrastructure, and can be built on open standards and specifications, as well as opensource software can enable delivery of services at societal-scale. In our voluntary efforts to make digital public infrastructure interoperable, we recognize the importance of data free flow with trust and cross-border data flows while respecting applicable legal frameworks. We also reaffirm the role of Data for Development.</p><p>Building Digital Public Infrastructure</p><p>56. We recognize that safe, secure, trusted, accountable and inclusive digital public infrastructure, respectful of human rights, personal data, privacy and intellectual property rights can foster resilience, and enable service delivery and innovation. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Welcome the G20 Framework for Systems of Digital Public Infrastructure, a voluntary and suggested framework for the development, deployment and governance of DPI.</p><p>ii. Welcome India's plan to build and maintain a Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository (GDPIR), a virtual repository of DPI, voluntarily shared by G20 members and beyond.</p><p>iii. Take note of the Indian Presidency's proposal of the One Future Alliance (OFA), a voluntary initiative aimed to build capacity, and provide technical assistance and adequate funding support for implementing DPI in LMICs.</p><p>Building Safety, Security, Resilience and Trust in the Digital Economy</p><p>57. An enabling, inclusive, open, fair, non-discriminatory and secure digital economy is increasingly important for all countries and stakeholders while respecting applicable legal frameworks. We will share our approaches and good practices to build a safe, secure and resilient digital economy. To this extent, we:</p><p>i. Welcome the non-binding G20 High-level Principles to Support Businesses in Building Safety, Security, Resilience, and Trust in the Digital Economy.</p><p>ii. Welcome the G20 Toolkit on Cyber Education and Cyber Awareness of Children and Youth.</p><p>Crypto-assets: Policy and Regulation</p><p>58. We continue to closely monitor the risks of the fast-paced developments in the cryptoasset ecosystem. We endorse the Financial Stability Board's (FSB's) high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of crypto-assets activities and markets and of global stablecoin arrangements. We ask the FSB and SSBs to promote the effective and timely implementation of these recommendations in a consistent manner globally to avoid regulatory arbitrage. We welcome the shared FSB and SSBs workplan for crypto assets. We welcome the IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper, including a Roadmap, that will support a coordinated and comprehensive policy and regulatory framework taking into account the full range of risks and risks specific to the emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) and ongoing global implementation of FATF standards to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks. Our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will discuss taking forward the Roadmap at their meeting in October 2023. We also welcome the BIS Report on The Crypto Ecosystem: Key Elements and Risks.</p><p>Central Bank Digital Currency</p><p>59. We welcome discussions on the potential macro-financial implications arising from the introduction and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), notably on cross-border payments as well as on the international monetary and financial system. We welcome the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) Report on Lessons Learnt on CBDCs and look forward to the IMF Report on Potential macro-financial implications of widespread adoption of CBDCs to advance the discussion on this issue.</p><p>Fostering Digital Ecosystems</p><p>60. We resolve to deploy all available digital tools and technologies and spare no effort in fostering safe and resilient digital ecosystems, and ensuring that every citizen on our planet is financially included. To support this, we:</p><p>i. Commit to promote responsible, sustainable and inclusive use of digital technology by farmers and an ecosystem of Agri-Tech start-ups and MSMEs.</p><p>ii. Welcome the establishment of the Global Initiative on Digital Health (GIDH) within a WHO-managed framework to build a comprehensive digital health ecosystem in compliance with respective data protection regulations.</p><p>iii. Will leverage digital technologies for the protection and promotion of culture and cultural heritage and adopt digital frameworks for the development of cultural and creative sectors and industries.</p><p>Harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Responsibly for Good and for All</p><p>61. The rapid progress of AI promises prosperity and expansion of the global digital economy. It is our endeavour to leverage AI for the public good by solving challenges in a responsible, inclusive and human-centric manner, while protecting people's rights and safety. To ensure responsible AI development, deployment and use, the protection of human rights, transparency and explainability, fairness, accountability, regulation, safety, appropriate human oversight, ethics, biases, privacy, and data protection must be addressed. To unlock the full potential of AI, equitably share its benefits and mitigate risks, we will work together to promote international cooperation and further discussions on international governance for AI. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Reaffirm our commitment to G20 AI Principles (2019) and endeavour to share information on approaches to using AI to support solutions in the digital economy.</p><p>ii. Will pursue a pro-innovation regulatory/governance approach that maximizes the benefits and takes into account the risks associated with the use of AI.</p><p>iii. Will promote responsible AI for achieving SDGs.</p><p>F. International Taxation</p><p>62. We reaffirm our commitment to continue cooperation towards a globally fair, sustainable and modern international tax system appropriate to the needs of the 21st century. We remain committed to the swift implementation of the two-pillar international tax package. Significant progress has been made on Pillar One including the delivery of a text of a Multilateral Convention (MLC), and work on Amount B (framework for simplified and streamlined application of the arm's length principle to in-country baseline marketing and distribution activities) as well as the completion of the work on the development of the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two. We call on the Inclusive Framework to resolve swiftly the few pending issues relating to the MLC with a view to preparing the MLC for signature in the second half of 2023 and completing the work on Amount B by the end of 2023. We welcome the steps taken by various countries to implement the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules as a common approach. We recognise the need for coordinated efforts towards capacity building to implement the two-pillar international tax package effectively and, in particular, welcome a plan for additional support and technical assistance for developing countries. We note the 2023 update of the G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Taxation. We call for the swift implementation of the CryptoAsset Reporting Framework (\"CARF\") and amendments to the CRS. We ask the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (\"Global Forum\") to identify an appropriate and coordinated timeline to commence exchanges by relevant jurisdictions, noting the aspiration of a significant number of these jurisdictions to start CARF exchanges by 2027 and to report to our future meetings on the progress of its work. We note the OECD Report on Enhancing International Tax Transparency on Real Estate and the Global Forum Report on Facilitating the Use of Tax-Treaty-Exchanged Information for Non-Tax Purposes.</p><p>G. Gender Equality and Empowering All Women and Girls</p><p>63. The G20 reaffirms that gender equality is of fundamental importance, and that investing in the empowerment of all women and girls, has a multiplier effect in implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>Enhancing Economic and Social Empowerment</p><p>64. We encourage women-led development and remain committed to enhancing women's full, equal, effective, and meaningful participation as decision makers for addressing global challenges inclusively and in contributing as active participants in all spheres of society, across all sectors and at all levels of the economy, which is not only crucial for achieving gender equality, but also for contributing to global GDP growth. To this end, we:</p><p>i. Reaffirm our commitment to achieving the Brisbane Goal to reduce the gap in labour force participation and implementing the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Goal '25 by 25' and ask the ILO and OECD to report progress annually.</p><p>ii.

Encourage and support initiatives by identifying, funding, and accelerating proven solutions, thereby improving women's livelihoods and income security.</p><p>vi. Welcome initiatives to support women empowerment in the digital economy.</p><p>Driving Gender Inclusive Climate Action</p><p>66. Acknowledging the disproportionate impact of climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification and pollution on all women and girls, accelerating climate action must have gender equality at its core. To this end, we will:</p><p>i. Support and increase women's participation, partnership, decision-making and leadership in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction strategies and policy frameworks on environmental issues.</p><p>ii. Support gender-responsive and environment-resilient solutions, including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) solutions, to build resilience to the impact of climate change and environmental degradation.</p><p>Securing Women's Food Security, Nutrition, and Well-Being</p><p>67. Women's food security and nutrition is the cornerstone of individual and community development as it lays the foundation for women's health, as well as that of her children, family and general well-being of the community. To this end, we will:</p><p>i. Encourage investments in inclusive, sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems. Support accessible, affordable, safe and nutritious food and healthy diets in school meal programmes. Promote innovation for inclusive agri-value chains and systems by and for women farmers.</p><p>ii. Support gender-responsive and age-sensitive nutrition and food system interventions by leveraging innovative financing instruments and social protection systems in ending hunger and malnutrition.</p><p>Creation of a Working Group on the Empowerment of Women</p><p>68. We agree to create a new Working Group on Empowerment of Women to support the G20 Women's Ministerial and look forward to the convening of its first meeting during the Brazilian G20 Presidency.</p><p>H. Financial Sector Issues</p><p>69. We continue to strongly support the work of the FSB and SSBs to address vulnerabilities and enhance the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) from a systemic perspective while monitoring evolving developments in NBFi. We welcome the FSB's consultation report on revisions to the FSB 2017 recommendations on addressing liquidity mismatch in open-ended funds and the FSB report on the financial stability implications of leverage in NBFI, and we support work to promote implementation of the FSB money market fund proposals. We welcome the FSB's recommendations to achieve greater convergence in cyber incident reporting, updates to the Cyber Lexicon and Concept Note for a Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE). We look forward to the FSB's further work on FIRE and ask the FSB to develop an action plan with appropriate timelines. We welcome the FSB's consultation Report on Enhancing Third-party Risk Management and Oversight. We expect the toolkit to support efforts in enhancing the operational resilience of financial institutions, addressing the challenges arising from their growing reliance on critical third-party service providers, including BigTechs and FinTechs, as well as reducing fragmentation in regulatory and supervisory approaches across jurisdictions and in different areas of the financial services sector.</p><p>70. We reaffirm our commitment to the effective implementation of the prioritised actions for the next phase of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments to achieve global targets for faster, cheaper, more transparent and inclusive cross-border payments by 2027 and welcome the initiatives undertaken by SSBs and international organisations in this direction. We welcome the successful conclusion of the G20 TechSprint 2023, a joint initiative with the BIS Innovation Hub, which will promote innovative solutions aimed at improving cross-border payments.</p><p>71. We welcome the annual progress report on the FSB's Roadmap for Addressing Financial Risks from Climate Change. We endorse the revised G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance with the aim to strengthen policy and regulatory frameworks for corporate governance that support sustainability and access to finance from capital markets, which in turn can contribute to the resilience of the broader economy. We reiterate our commitment to promote sustainable capital flows. To this effect, we take note of the OECD's Report, \"Towards Orderly Green Transition Investment Requirements and Managing Risks to Capital Flows\".</p><p>I. Countering Terrorism and Money laundering</p><p>72. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including those on the basis of xenophobia, racism and other forms of intolerance, or in the name of religion or belief, recognizing the commitment of all religions to peace. It constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.</p><p>73. We strongly condemn all terrorist acts against critical infrastructure, including critical energy facilities, and against other vulnerable targets. All acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed. Effective counterterrorism measures, support for the victims of terrorism and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing. A holistic approach on the basis of international law can effectively counter terrorism. Efforts to increase the effectiveness of international cooperation should be strengthened to deny terrorist groups safe haven, freedom of operations, movement and recruitment, as well as financial, material or political support.</p><p>74. We also express concern about illicit trafficking and diversion of small arms and light weapons. International cooperation among States is critical to combat these phenomena, including export, import controls, and tracing.</p><p>75. We commit to supporting the increasing resource needs of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and FATF Style Regional Bodies and encourage others to do the same, including for the next round of mutual evaluations. We remain committed to the timely and global implementation of the revised FATF Standards on the transparency of beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements to make it more difficult for criminals to hide and launder ill-gotten gains. We welcome the ongoing work of the FATF to enhance global efforts to recover criminal proceeds, in particular, the progress made by the FATF towards revising its standards on asset recovery and reinforcing global asset recovery networks. We reiterate the importance of countries developing and implementing effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks to mitigate risks associated with virtual assets in line with FATF Standards, especially for terrorism financing, money laundering, and proliferation financing risks. In this regard, we support the FATF's initiative to accelerate the global implementation of its standards, including the \"travel rule\", and its work on risks of emerging technologies and innovations, including decentralised finance (DeFi) arrangements and peer-to-peer transactions.</p><p>J. Creating a More Inclusive World</p><p>76. We welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and strongly believe that inclusion of the African Union into the G20 will significantly contribute to addressing the global challenges of our time. We commend the efforts of all G20 members which paved the way for accession of the African Union as a permanent member during India's Presidency of the G20. Africa plays an important role in the global economy. We commit to strengthen our ties with and support the African Union realise the aspirations under Agenda 2063. We also reiterate strong support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa and G20 Initiative on supporting industrialization in Africa and LDCs. We are supportive of further discussing the deepening of cooperation between the G20 and other regional partners.</p><p>77. We reaffirm our commitment to support migrants, including migrant workers and refugees in our efforts towards a more inclusive world, in line with national policies, legislations and circumstances, ensuring full respect for the human rights and their fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We also recognize the importance of preventing irregular migration flows and the smuggling of migrants, as part of a comprehensive approach for safe, orderly and regular migration while responding to humanitarian needs and the root causes of displacement. We support strengthening cooperation between countries of origin, transit and destination. We will continue the dialogue on migration and forced displacement during future Presidencies.</p><p>78. We note the UNGA Resolution A/RES/77/318, particularly its commitment to promote respect for religious and cultural diversity, dialogue and tolerance. We also emphasize that freedom of religion or belief, freedom of opinion or expression, the right to peaceful assembly, and the right to freedom of association are interdependent, inter-related and mutually reinforcing and stress the role that these rights can play in the fight against all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. In this regard, we strongly deplore all acts of religious hatred against persons, as well as those of a symbolic nature without prejudice to domestic legal frameworks, including against religious symbols and holy books.</p><p>79. We will continue to integrate the perspectives of the developing countries into the G20 agendas and appreciate the G20 members' initiatives in this regard.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>80. We thank India for successfully hosting the 18th G20 Summit in New Delhi, for its warm welcome to delegates, and for its valuable contributions to the strengthening of the G20. We appreciate the successful conclusion of various G20 Working Groups and Ministerial meetings and welcome their outcomes as annexed. We also congratulate India on the successful landing on the moon on 23 August 2023.</p><p>81. We reiterate our commitment to the G20 as the premier forum for global economic cooperation and its continued operation in the spirit of multilateralism, on the basis of consensus, with all members participating on an equal footing in all its events including Summits. We look forward to meeting again in Brazil in 2024 and in South Africa in 2025, as well as in the United States in 2026 at the beginning of the next cycle. We welcome Saudi Arabia's ambition to advance its turn for hosting the G20 Presidency in the next cycle. We also look forward to the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2024 as a symbol of peace, dialogue amongst nations and inclusivity, with participation of all.</p><p>82.

Sections of Hwy. 2 and Minnesota Hwy. 1 were closed, as were nearby trails, boat launches and campgrounds.</p><p>Law enforcement and emergency personnel went door-to-door notifying residents if they are in an evacuation area and posted notices. About 75 residences have been affected, according to the Forest Service.</p><p>The fire is \"torching and spotting,\" said Jeb Backe, an incident commander for the Superior National Forest, meaning trees are igniting and flaring up and sparks are being carried by the wind and starting new fires.</p><p>Top priorities are public and firefighter safety, along with protecting structures, he said, but \"our biggest concern is new starts, as we're limited on resources.\"</p><p>He asked people to abide by the county's burning ban, which includes private property. Firefighters are attacking the blaze from the air and the ground, dropping water from planes and starting containment lines where they can, a task made more difficult because of the inaccessibility of the forestland. Fire officials expect a northern path and encourage people to stay out of the area.</p><p>The cause of the fire is unknown, Backe said.</p><p>Superior National Forest fire manager Nick Petrack said in a social media video update that the fire's behavior is \"extreme.\"</p><p>\"With the current weather we expect the fire to remain very active in the next three to four days,\" he said. With mixed conifers fueling the blaze, making it challenging for crews to suppress, more fire personnel are expected to join in the next day, he said.</p><p>Gov. Tim Walz authorized Minnesota National Guard support for northern wildfires on Monday. Along with the activation of 16 soldiers and two airmen, the St. Paul-based 2-147 Assault Helicopter Battalion is sending two Black Hawk helicopters and two Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks. The Duluth-based 148th Fighter Wing is sending a fuel truck.</p><p>An air quality alert has been issued for Lake County through Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>The Greenwood fire is one of many burning in the northern half of the state. Several within the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness have been contained, but new fires, like the Whelp and John Elk fires northeast of Isabella, continue to crop up. The Quetico Provincial Park fires closest to the Minnesota border remain active and monitored by the Forest Service.</p><p>Staff writer Alex Chhith contributed to this report.</p><p>Jana Hollingsworth \u00b7 218-508-2450</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN63994177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D3-TRG1-JC8F-K0CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 17, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Canoes</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZFNUYxOUY5M0I1NEE3NUE1RjY2RjhBNjdDNjU3NkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUJGMzIwOUU1NUY0NDU3MzhFRjhFRkMxQzgxOEI3MEY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

It's already so warm... what will happen later in summer?\" said Abbas Ali, who was with his young son. <br/> Volunteers in Karachi prepare Rooh Afza, a sweet beverage widely consumed during Islam's holy month of Ramadan Photo: AFP / Asif HASSAN  <br/>In the teeming Indian megacity of New Delhi, which hit 43 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit) on Friday, authorities said many power stations had \"less than a day's coal left\". <br/>\"The situation in entire India is dire,\" said Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's chief minister, warning of potential power cuts to hospitals and the city's metro. <br/> Girls eat ice lollies while shopping on a hot summer afternoon in New Delhi Photo: AFP / Prakash SINGH  <br/>A fire at a landfill 60 metres (almost 200 feet) high in Delhi was still smouldering on Friday for a fourth day. <br/>Indian states including Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have cut back power supply to industrial areas because of coal shortages at power stations. <br/>India also cancelled some passenger trains to allow for faster movement of coal at power plants in a bid to avoid a full-blown crisis, Bloomberg News reported. <br/>In Kolkata, drooping public transport passengers were being given glucose water after a spate of cases of heatstroke in recent days. <br/>\"With no rain for over 57 days, Kolkata is in the grip of the longest dry spell of this millennium,\" said Sanjit Bandyopadhyay from the Regional Meteorological Centre. <br/>Coming during the month of Ramadan, the heat makes fasting in India and Pakistan even tougher for Muslims who shun even water during daylight hours for the holy month. <br/>When the sun sets, vendors are doing a roaring trade in Rooh Afza, a sugary pink drink that has been quenching thirst for generations across the subcontinent. <br/>In India authorities were closing schools or reducing hours, with Bihar ordering classes to stop by 10:45 am and advising people not to be outside after midday. <br/>In the Bihar state capital Patna, heatstroke cases have jumped in the last 10 days and the number of children with fever, vomiting and diarrhoea has increased. <br/>\"People have been staying inside their house in day time. We are struggling to earn a livelihood,\" said Rameshwar Paswan, a rickshaw puller. <br/>Previously, India saw such temperatures in April only once every 50 years but now they come around every four, said Mariam Zachariah from the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. <br/>\"Until net emissions are halted, it will continue to become even more common,\" she said. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

News: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com\">http://www.ibtimes.com</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> The number of major wildfires worldwide will rise sharply in coming decades due to global warming, and governments are ill-prepared for the death and destruction such mega-blazes trail in their wake, the UN warned Wednesday. </p><p><br/>Even the most ambitious efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions will not prevent a dramatic surge in the frequency of extreme fire conditions, a report commissioned by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) concluded. <br/>\"By the end of the century, the probability of wildfire events similar to Australia's 2019-2020 Black Summer or the huge Arctic fires in 2020 occurring in a given year is likely to increase by 31-57 percent,\" it said. <br/> An aerial view shows burned properties in Clearlake, California in August 2021 Photo: AFP / JOSH EDELSON  <br/>The heating of the planet is turning landscapes into tinderboxes, and more extreme weather means stronger, hotter and drier winds to fan the flames. <br/>Such wildfires are burning where they have always occurred, and are flaring up in unexpected places such as drying peatlands and thawing permafrost. <br/>\"Fires are not good things,\" said co-author Peter, an expert in forest fire management at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). <br/>\"The impacts on people -- socially, health-wise, psychologically -- are phenomenal and long-term,\" he told journalists in a briefing. <br/> The heating of the planet is turning landscapes into tinderboxes, and more extreme weather means stronger, hotter and drier winds to fan the flames Photo: AFP / CESAR MANSO  <br/>Large wildfires, which can rage uncontrolled for days or weeks, cause respiratory and heart problems, especially for the elderly and very young. <br/>A recent study in The Lancet concluded that exposure to wildfire smoke results, on average, in more than 30,000 deaths each year across 43 nations for which data was available. <br/>Economic damages in the United States -- one of the few countries to calculate such costs -- have varied between $71 to $348 billion (63 to 307 billion euros) in recent years, according to an assessment cited in the report. <br/> Satellite image showing color infrared overview of fire lines south of Lame Deer, Montana in August 2021 Photo: Satellite image 2021 Maxar Technologies via AFP / Handout  <br/>Major blazes can also be devastating for wildlife, pushing some endangered species closer to the brink of extinction. <br/>Nearly three billion mammals, reptiles, birds and frogs were killed or harmed, for example, by Australia's devastating 2019-20 bushfires, scientists have calculated. <br/>Wildfires are made worse by climate change. <br/>Heatwaves, drought conditions and reduced soil moisture amplified by global warming have contributed to unprecedented fires in the western United States, Australia and the Mediterranean basin just in the last three years. <br/>Even the Arctic -- previously all but immune to fires -- has seen a dramatic increase in blazes, including so-called \"zombie fires\" that smoulder underground throughout winter before bursting into flames anew. <br/>But wildfires also accelerate climate change, feeding a vicious cycle of more fires and rising temperatures. <br/>Last year, forests going up in flames emitted more than 2.5 billion tonnes of planet-warming CO2 in July and August alone, equivalent to India's annual emissions from all sources, the European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reported. <br/>Compiled by 50 top experts, the report called for a rethink on how to tackle the problem. <br/>\"Current government responses to wildfires are often putting money in the wrong places,\" investing in managing fires once they start rather than prevention and risk reduction, said UN Environment chief Inger Andersen. <br/>\"We have to minimise the risk of extreme wildfires by being prepared.\" <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the

Adam Coates, an expert in forest fire ecology and management at Virginia Tech, says there are many intricacies of climate change that lead to these extreme weather patterns, including how temperature and precipitation are being altered.</p><p>\"The elevated temperatures seen in many locations today are also accompanied by a lack of adequate precipitation during the times when temperatures are elevated. When temperatures are elevated and precipitation is low, vegetation may dry,\" says Coates.</p><p>Coates says ingredients that fuel wildfire ignitions are heat, oxygen, and dry vegetation.</p><p>\"Whether by way of lightning ignitions or the activities of humans - such as the failure to extinguish campfires or arson - fires often ignite under these conditions,\" says Coates. \"As many natural landscapes have gone years without adequate management, fuel loads and structures are often primed for significant wildfire activity.\"</p><p>For communities and neighborhoods at risk from wildfires this season, Coates offers the following advice on how to protect your home.</p><p>\"People can really abide by two rules. First, follow local ordinances and common sense - do not conduct outdoor burns when local conditions suggest wildfire risk is elevated. Go the extra mile to appropriately extinguish campfires and other open fires when burning is allowed.\"</p><p>\"Second, promote and advocate for active wildland management. Fuels and other materials naturally accumulate in the absence of active forest and wildland management that may include forest harvesting, thinning, and invasive species management.\"</p><p>Coates says if you own a home, especially in a fire-prone area, ensure that your community is working to reduce the risk of wildfires by following the guidelines set forth by FireWise.</p><p>About Coates</p><p>Coates is an assistant professor in the department of forest resources and environmental conservation, in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment.Coates maintains an active research program focused primarily on fire ecology. This includes elements of fire behavior, fuels, fire effects, silviculture, and restoration ecology.Read more here.</p><p>Schedule an interview</p><p>To secure a live or recorded interview with Adam Coates, contact Bill Foy by email, or by phone at (540) 998-0288, or Shannon Andrea by email, or by phone at (703) 399-9494.</p><p>Our studio</p><p>Virginia Tech's television and radio studios can broadcast live HD audio and video to networks, news outlets, and affiliates interviewing Virginia Tech faculty and staff.

When the news broke, I was in shock.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The two other members of the group, rapper Ritchie with a T and producer Parker Corey, went quiet for over a year. Then, last month, they suddenly returned to social media and announced they would be releasing an album, \"By The Time I Get To Phoenix.\"</p><p>As the first project without Groggs, the only thing I could imagine was that the album would be a tribute to him.</p><p>The group is known for their experimental and bombastic sound characterized by hard bass, electronic sound effects, energetic rapping, and the occasional emotional track to complement.</p><p>\"By The Time I Get to Phoenix\" is an entirely different experience.</p><p>The first single from the album, \"Knees,\" was not at all what I expected to hear. Instead of brash and confident lyrics, Ritchie repeatedly croons the words \"Knees hurt me when I grow / And that's a tough pill to swallow\" throughout the track. His vocals are dripping with autotune, yet they still feel raw and heartfelt.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The opening track on the album, \"Outside,\" sets the tone for the noisy, abstract and moving experience to come.\u00a0</p><p>It's turbulent, sparse and dystopian, like it was made in a barren wasteland after society's collapse. Ritchie's vocals are delivered in a frantic and aggressive manner, leaving the listener dazed and confused.</p><p>The only listed feature of the album comes from Detroit rapper ZelooperZ on \"SS San Francisco.\" His music has a very abrasive and cocky style, yet here he opts for a completely new sound.</p><p>Ritchie and ZelooperZ both give intense verses. Add in a deep guitar riff and disorienting noises in the background, and the entire track takes on a haunting, intimidating feel.\u00a0</p><p>\"Footwork In A Forest Fire,\" \"Ground Zero\" and \"Smoke Don't Clear\" each follow one another and epitomize the powerful soundscapes that make this album so impressive and unique.</p><p>Enjoy what you're reading?Signup for our newsletter</p><p>Email Address</p><p>Then comes \"Top Picks For You.\"</p><p>This is their direct tribute to Groggs, and wow.\u00a0</p><p>Ritchie raps about the memory of his fallen partner, and the way it feels unreal, as if he should still be here with him. Yet he knows that he's gone and never coming back. It's passionate and touching, angelic yet chaotic - in a way, transcendent.</p><p>It's followed by \"Wild Wild West,\" a glitchy and aggressive banger with quick, choppy vocals that feel like an assault on the ears.</p><p>\"Postpostpartum,\" one of the more mellow tracks, carries more familiar sounds in production and a melancholic tone to the vocal delivery. It feels like an ode to the band's maturity and their place in the industry.</p><p>The final track, \"Bye Storm,\" feels somber but hopeful and leaves the listener on a high note. Ritchie and a posthumous Groggs discuss dealing with hardships, and how to push through.</p><p>This album is not for everyone. It is challenging and at times overwhelming, yet it's this same quality that makes it deeply impressive.</p><p>Injury Reserve manage to evoke profound emotion primarily through sound, and the lyrics only further those sensations of pain and shock.\u00a0</p><p>\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\" is an intricately assembled avant-garde piece of music that draws from a wide array of music, seamlessly blending them together into a moving final tribute to Groggs.</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mezacuem@miamioh.edu\">mezacuem@miamioh.edu</email></p><p>Read More</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5889338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CGC-8FX1-JBSN-3084-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"573\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Miami Student: Miami University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 12, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Miami</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6M</classCode><className>RAP MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S23</classCode><className>HIP HOP CULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

While I know this hearing room brings back memories from your time working with us on this committee, today you join us as a nominee. Thank you for being here and for your willingness to serve our nation at this critical point in our history. Before I talk about Mr. Goffman's experience and qualifications, let me begin by setting the table for what's at stake with his nomination.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, we have come a long way in terms of reducing air pollution and doing so without harming our nation's economy. Since Congress passed the historic Clean Air Act of 1970, we have reduced our nation's soot and smog pollution by nearly 80 percent, while our gross domestic product grew by more than 250 percent, adjusting for inflation.</p><p>\"Along the way, we have found that cleaner air is an enormous benefit to all Americans, with the benefits outweighing the costs by nearly 30 to 1.</p><p>\"Yet, despite all our successes, many of the most vulnerable Americans still breathe unhealthy air, especially those living in disadvantaged and low-income communities. According to EPA's research, nonwhite children today are much more likely to die from air pollution than white children in our country.</p><p>\"We have a moral imperative to do more to help all Americans breathe healthy air. And, we can no longer turn a blind eye to downwind and frontline communities.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have a moral imperative to do all we can to save this planet that we call home from the perils of climate change. But, we are running out of time to change course before it's too late.</p><p>\"Last month, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that it is 'now or never' if we are going to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid a future with disastrous, irreversible climate impacts.</p><p>\"Communities across our country and the planet are already feeling the impacts of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, historic droughts, and other extreme weather.</p><p>\"Just last week, the National Weather Service released its seasonal outlook. It predicted that the drought gripping the American West and fueling record-breaking wildfires would persist throughout the summer. As we gather here today, the state of New Mexico continues to battle the worst forest fire in its history.</p><p>\"To put it simply, the climate crisis is here. We are at a critical point when it comes to addressing this crisis and mobilizing our nation towards a better future by transitioning away from fossil fuels and deploying cleaner technologies.</p><p>\"Fortunately, we have an EPA under the Biden Administration - in particular, the Office of Air and Radiation - that's willing to follow the law and tackle these great clean air and climate challenges that lay in front of us.</p><p>\"With all of this said, it's clear the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation has an outsized impact on our lives - from protecting Americans from planet-warming pollution to cleaning up air toxics to improving vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>\"President Biden selected Joe Goffman to lead this office because he knows that Mr. Goffman is up to the task. Throughout his time at EPA, Joe Goffman has demonstrated his commitment to following the law in a way that provides cleaner air and a safer climate for all, while also providing predictability and certainty for industry - predictability and certainty are always top priorities for businesses.</p><p>\"A great example of this is Mr. Goffman's integral role in the crafting of the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule while he was at EPA under the Obama Administration. This rule helped reduce mercury and other air toxic emissions from our nation's power plants by 90 percent, protecting the health of pregnant women and children across our nation.</p><p>\"Despite early industry concerns the rule would cause blackouts, there were not any. In fact, the rule was achieved by every utility in the country on time and under budget. Today every major utility organization supports the rule. It has enabled us to achieve major health benefits across this country, which is fundamental to job creation and preservation. This is just one example of why Mr. Goffman is so deeply respected and highly qualified for the job at hand.</p><p>\"Joe has garnered broad support from the environmental community and industry. This includes utility organizations like the Edison Electric Institute, biofuel groups such as the Renewable Fuels Association, Tribal organizations like the National Tribal Air Association, as well as some of our largest unions, including the AFL-CIO.</p><p>\"Even the United Mine Workers, our nation's largest union of coal miners, have voiced their support for Mr. Goffman's nomination to lead the Office of Air and Radiation.</p><p>\"Having worked with Mr. Goffman, I know he is well prepared for this role. He is a life-long public servant with nearly a decade of experience at the Office of Air and Radiation, as well as several stints on our EPW committee, including working for me. He also spent time as a staffer for former Senator Joe Lieberman. We look forward to hearing from Joe today.\" For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR4115198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J3-B711-F12F-F06W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"979\"/><timeReceived>2:33 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Ltd.

Dick Durbin issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Ted Deutch (D-FL-22) today introduced the Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act, a bicameral bill that would authorize the U.S. Department of Treasury to issue from $200 million up to $1 billion in state and local tax-exempt \"climate bonds\" annually for any American to purchase and contribute to the government's efforts to combat the impacts of climate change. The legislation would set up a system similar to the war bonds effort during World War II, when the government issued securities to pull money from the economy to control inflation and finance critically important government operations.</p><p>\"I'm introducing this bill because I believe climate change is one of the gravest threats mankind faces, period,\" Durbin said. \"President Trump and Republicans in Congress still don't take climate change seriously. If we want our children to inherit a livable planet, then this bill would guide us in the right direction and should be part of our overall strategy to combat climate change.\"</p><p>\"Congress has an important role to play in addressing climate change. While local communities and states are on the front lines of this crisis, we need a federal response to support their efforts. This fund would give the federal government and everyday Americans a way to invest in climate change mitigation and resiliency projects,\" said Deutch.</p><p>Bond proceeds from Durbin and Deutch's bill would fund a new \"Climate Change Resiliency Fund,\" administered by the Commerce Department, for grants to be used on climate change resiliency projects, such as flood control, structural fortifications, forest fire prevention, desalinization plants, cooling centers, and more. Eligible grant recipients include federal, state, and local governments; utilities; tribes; transit groups; nonprofits; coalitions; or other organizations as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the bill creates a Climate Change Advisory Commission of 11 bipartisan members appointed by the House, Senate, and President to establish program requirements, and to vet and approve these projects.</p><p>More information on the bill is available here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.durbin.senate.gov/download/climate-change-resiliency-fund-for-america-act-one-pager\">https://www.durbin.senate.gov/download/climate-change-resiliency-fund-for-america-act-one-pager</url>).

While I know this hearing room brings back memories from your time working with us on this committee, today you join us as a nominee. Thank you for being here and for your willingness to serve our nation at this critical point in our history. Before I talk about Mr. Goffman's experience and qualifications, let me begin by setting the table for what's at stake with his nomination.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, we have come a long way in terms of reducing air pollution and doing so without harming our nation's economy. Since Congress passed the historic Clean Air Act of 1970, we have reduced our nation's soot and smog pollution by nearly 80 percent, while our gross domestic product grew by more than 250 percent, adjusting for inflation.</p><p>\"Along the way, we have found that cleaner air is an enormous benefit to all Americans, with the benefits outweighing the costs by nearly 30 to 1.</p><p>\"Yet, despite all our successes, many of the most vulnerable Americans still breathe unhealthy air, especially those living in disadvantaged and low-income communities. According to EPA's research, nonwhite children today are much more likely to die from air pollution than white children in our country.</p><p>\"We have a moral imperative to do more to help all Americans breathe healthy air. And, we can no longer turn a blind eye to downwind and frontline communities.</p><p>\"At the same time, we have a moral imperative to do all we can to save this planet that we call home from the perils of climate change. But, we are running out of time to change course before it's too late.</p><p>\"Last month, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that it is 'now or never' if we are going to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid a future with disastrous, irreversible climate impacts.</p><p>\"Communities across our country and the planet are already feeling the impacts of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, historic droughts, and other extreme weather.</p><p>\"Just last week, the National Weather Service released its seasonal outlook. It predicted that the drought gripping the American West and fueling record-breaking wildfires would persist throughout the summer. As we gather here today, the state of New Mexico continues to battle the worst forest fire in its history.</p><p>\"To put it simply, the climate crisis is here. We are at a critical point when it comes to addressing this crisis and mobilizing our nation towards a better future by transitioning away from fossil fuels and deploying cleaner technologies.</p><p>\"Fortunately, we have an EPA under the Biden Administration -- in particular, the Office of Air and Radiation -- that's willing to follow the law and tackle these great clean air and climate challenges that lay in front of us.</p><p>\"With all of this said, it's clear the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation has an outsized impact on our lives -- from protecting Americans from planet-warming pollution to cleaning up air toxics to improving vehicle emissions standards.</p><p>\"President Biden selected Joe Goffman to lead this office because he knows that Mr. Goffman is up to the task. Throughout his time at EPA, Joe Goffman has demonstrated his commitment to following the law in a way that provides cleaner air and a safer climate for all, while also providing predictability and certainty for industry -- predictability and certainty are always top priorities for businesses.</p><p>\"A great example of this is Mr. Goffman's integral role in the crafting of the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule while he was at EPA under the Obama Administration. This rule helped reduce mercury and other air toxic emissions from our nation's power plants by 90 percent, protecting the health of pregnant women and children across our nation.</p><p>\"Despite early industry concerns the rule would cause blackouts, there were not any. In fact, the rule was achieved by every utility in the country on time and under budget. Today every major utility organization supports the rule. It has enabled us to achieve major health benefits across this country, which is fundamental to job creation and preservation. This is just one example of why Mr. Goffman is so deeply respected and highly qualified for the job at hand.</p><p>\"Joe has garnered broad support from the environmental community and industry. This includes utility organizations like the Edison Electric Institute, biofuel groups such as the Renewable Fuels Association, Tribal organizations like the National Tribal Air Association, as well as some of our largest unions, including the AFL-CIO.</p><p>\"Even the United Mine Workers, our nation's largest union of coal miners, have voiced their support for Mr. Goffman's nomination to lead the Office of Air and Radiation.</p><p>\"Having worked with Mr. Goffman, I know he is well prepared for this role. He is a life-long public servant with nearly a decade of experience at the Office of Air and Radiation, as well as several stints on our EPW committee, including working for me. He also spent time as a staffer for former Senator Joe Lieberman. We look forward to hearing from Joe today.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=C0964B8F-36B8-429A-A154-168423890E5B\">https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=C0964B8F-36B8-429A-A154-168423890E5B</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSSP525211B3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J3-N3M1-JCCP-0446-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 25, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In fact, the rule was achieved by every utility in the country on time and under budget. Today every major utility organization supports the rule. It has enabled us to achieve major health benefits across this country, which is fundamental to job creation and preservation. This is just one example of why Mr. Goffman is so deeply respected and highly qualified for the job at hand.</p><p>\"Joe has garnered broad support from the environmental community and industry. This includes utility organizations like the Edison Electric Institute, biofuel groups such as the Renewable Fuels Association, Tribal organizations like the National Tribal Air Association, as well as some of our largest unions, including the AFL-CIO.</p><p>\"Even the United Mine Workers, our nation's largest union of coal miners, have voiced their support for Mr. Goffman's nomination to lead the Office of Air and Radiation.</p><p>\"Having worked with Mr. Goffman, I know he is well prepared for this role. He is a life-long public servant with nearly a decade of experience at the Office of Air and Radiation, as well as several stints on our EPW committee, including working for me. He also spent time as a staffer for former Senator Joe Lieberman. We look forward to hearing from Joe today.\"</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125239613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J2-19T1-JCBF-S31M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 25, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It covered two forest types - mixed species forest and ash forest.</p><p>The scientific evidence showed that across almost every forest age and type, thinning made little difference. It actually increased the likelihood of a crown burn in older, mixed species forests, and slightly reduced the chance of crown burn in younger aged, mixed species forest.</p><p>Lead author Dr Chris Taylor, from the ANU Fenner School of Environment and Society, said thinning made very little difference to fire severity.</p><p>\"The impact of thinning varied with forest type, the age of the forest and fire conditions,\" Dr Taylor said.</p><p>\"Across most forest types and ages, thinning had little impact on forest fire severity, although it did worsen severity in mixed species forest aged 70 years plus and did reduce it in mixed species forest aged 20-40 years.</p><p>\"Overall, the evidence indicates thinning forests does not reduce fire risk.\"</p><p>The study also found 20- to 40- year old forest was more likely to suffer crown burn than 70-year-old forest. It also suggested more study could still be done on the topic.</p><p>\"A previous report found thinning of forests increased fire risk,\" Dr Taylor said. \"And multiple previous studies have also found fire severity is lower in older, undisturbed and unlogged forests.\"</p><p>Dr Taylor also noted previous Silvicultural Guides to control forest growth for Victoria and Tasmania have stated thinning would produce an \"increase in fire hazard\" due to \"high fuel loads\".</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Conservation Letters - <url normalizedValue=\"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12766\">https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/conl.12766</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7260910 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7260910</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:611F-0BS1-JC11-1311-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"338\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 9, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Cowan, a doctoral student in anthropology, centers her research on the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board, using ethnography, which involves interviews, field notes and long-term immersion into a culture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The traditional object of study for anthropologists was 'the other,' meaning cultures foreign to people of European descent. These days we study just about everything, but with some of the same principles we had even 100 years ago: namely that everything should be studied on its own terms,\" she explained. \"We try not to go into situations with preconceived notions, and we are always in the process of checking our biases.\"</p><p>Cowan is a native of Hope in British Columbia, an area popularly known as the setting of the 1982 action film Rambo: First Blood. Cowan earned both her bachelor's and master's in anthropology at the University of Victoria before heading to Binghamton. As luck would have it, the pandemic hit eight months into her doctoral program and she has been pursuing her degree from her Canadian home ever since.</p><p>CPP Investments, as the board is known, is worth more than half a trillion Canadian dollars and responsible for funding the country's pension plan. However, it is also a major player in the world of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, and climate finance in general. Pension plans play a major role in spurring this new style of investing, explained Cowan, whose research is funded by a doctoral fellowship through the Canadian government's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.</p><p>\"This means the investments they make have to be on a long-term horizon. Risk vs. reward are definitely at play because of this,\" Cowan explained. \"However, ESG investing is also about an intangible moral benefit that comes with making choices less destructive to our planet, and to society.\"</p><p>Investments through the board are chosen for their record of environmental and social impact, as well as board structure and compensation. The fund uses their controlling shares in companies to keep them in alignment with these principles, and recently appointed its first chief sustainability officer.</p><p>Thus far, Cowan has engaged with the fund through their literature and public meetings, and kept track of public comment about them, particularly from Canada's New Democratic Party. Despite the fund's commitment to sustainable investing, they still have large sums of money tied up in the oil and gas industry, she discovered.</p><p>As a native of Western Canada, she is well-versed in the controversies surrounding oil and gas, which are reflected heavily in the questions asked during the fund's public meetings. While many people in British Columbia demanded that the fund divest from fossil fuels immediately, many Albertans pushed for more investment in this area.</p><p>\"It's a really raw, emotional argument, since oil and gas have traditionally been a source of jobs for many Western Canadians,\" she said. \"The government in Alberta has even threatened to have its pensions managed by AIMCo instead, a public corporation with a dubious track record.\"</p><p>Since Cowan first began studying CPP Investments in 2019, the topic has gained increasing relevance. Lytton, a community very close to her hometown, was devastated by a forest fire several months ago, while the lower BC mainland was recently struck by devastating flooding and mudslides; such phenomena have been linked to larger patterns of climate change. Sustainable investing has come up repeatedly at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland, she noted.</p><p>\"We cannot have large corporations, public or not, making investments that will contribute to the problems our world is facing,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124869954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6469-BKD1-JCBF-S020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 29, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We make the following extracts:</p><p>The great fires are spreading. All day yesterday the people were fighting the flames two or three miles south and southwest of the city. In the towns of Eldorado and Friendship considerable damage has been done, and the fires are still in progress. The news from Calumet county creates anxiety. The flames are rushing at a fearful rate through the great forests. Many residences are being destroyed. Hay on the marshes is being destroyed by the hundreds of tons. Much grain is also being destroyed. In Sheboygan county the fire is spreading equally rapidly. At last accounts it was nearing the village of St. Cloud. People have been out fighting the fire for a day or two. An immense fire is burning between St. Cloud and the town of Russell, in Sheboygan county.</p><p>MENOMINCE, Oct. 10</p><p>Mayor of Fond du Lac:-A horrible calamity fell upon these towns on Sunday night and yesterday morning. Peshtigo Village, Mills and Sugar Bush Settlement are entirely destroyed by fire. About three hundred lives lost. The dead are lying in the streets. It is terrible to look upon. We need all the medical aid you can send us at once. Pray send it. Mennekonee all burned and half of Marinette, but Peshtigo is the worst calamity of all. The burned and dead need help at once.

They see it almost every spring, he said.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the guys will just go to the department and sit and wait because they know there are going to be fires,\u201d said Deppen, an assistant forest manager at the state Department of Conservation and Natural resources.</p><p>In this case, they were right.</p><p>On Sunday, 27 reported wildfires were called into the 911 center here, according to a supervisor with Lancaster County-Wide Communications.</p><p>One of those fires in Lancaster Township sparked an apartment blaze, displacing four people and their pets; another in Conestoga Township ignited a barn; and in West Donegal Township, firefighters were called to extinguish flaming brush and debris that had fallen onto railroad tracks.</p><p>\u2018Bad decisions\u2019</p><p>While Deppen couldn\u2019t speak for every case, he said many brush fires have a common cause.</p><p>\u201cPeople make bad decisions,\u201d Deppen said.</p><p>Specifically, he was speaking about people who cause wildfires by being reckless with flames when weather conditions allow them to easily spread.</p><p>\u201cYesterday was not a day for burning debris,\u201d Deppen said Monday, echoing an earlier warning from forecasters at the National Weather Service who cautioned against outdoor flames.</p><p>That\u2019s because it\u2019s wildfire season in Pennsylvania, where dry conditions are more likely from late winter through May, according to National Weather Service meteorologist David Martin.</p><p>\u201cEarly spring is the most common time of the year for wildfires,\u201d he said.</p><p>During that period, the winter\u2019s snow typically melts away, exposing dry grass, leafless trees and other flammable brush. On sunny days when humidity is low, those dry surfaces can easily fuel fast-growing fires, Martin said, adding that flames can be carried by wind on blustery days.</p><p>Brush fire ignites roof</p><p>That was true in the case of the Lancaster Township fire Sunday evening at the Kensington Club Apartments in the 600 block of Wyncroft Lane.</p><p>Firefighters were initially called to the area for a brush and grass fire outside of an apartment. But when firefighters arrived the brush fire appeared to be out, and smoke was instead coming from the roof of a building.</p><p>That\u2019s according to Lancaster Township Fire Department assistant chief Glenn Usdin, who said wind apparently carried an ember from the brush to ignite dry debris on the apartment roof, which was about 70 feet away.</p><p>The initial brush fire probably was caused by a discarded cigarette, Usdin said.</p><p>Wind also contributed to the Sunday afternoon barn fire in the 1200 block of Stoney Lane in Conestoga Township, according to Conestoga Fire Company Chief Larry Frankford Jr.</p><p>A trash pile that hadn\u2019t been burned for two weeks was the likely cause, Frankford said.</p><p>\u201cThe wind is what did it. The wind rekindled the embers,\u201d Frankford said, adding that gusts carried those embers about 200 yards from the trash pile to the barn, catching fire along the way.</p><p>The fire did minimal damage, he said, but it highlights the hazards of fire-favorable weather.</p><p>\u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be burning on windy days,\u201d Frankford said.</p><p>Not just a West Coast problem</p><p>According to Forest Fire Warden Mike Hall, that advice has been given seemingly countless times and promoted through family friendly campaigns like Smokey Bear\u2019s slogan: \u201cOnly you can prevent wildfires.\u201d</p><p>Still, most brush and forest fires are caused by humans, said Hall, a leader of Keystone Wildfire Crew \u2014 about 20 volunteers who specialize in extinguishing wildfires in the region, primarily in Lancaster County.</p><p>Firefighters in the Keystone crew, carrying specialized equipment, must study weather, topography and other factors to assess how to best extinguish each individual blaze.</p><p>On Monday, Hall guessed that local residents sometimes ignore related warnings because they think of wildfires as a West Coast problem due to the news coverage of high profile infernos that, in recent years, have regularly spread across places like California.</p><p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t see that here, and the general population just isn\u2019t aware of it,\u201d Hall said.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean smaller fires aren\u2019t dangerous.</p><p>\u201cBrush fires can kill you. They are not stationary,\u201d Hall said, explaining they can spread quickly.</p><p>York County fire</p><p>A forest fire tore through South Mountain in Franklin Township, York County, Sunday night, too. That fire was started accidently at Camp Tuckahoe, a Boy Scout facility, according to PennLive reports.</p><p>Lancaster County firefighters also were called to neighboring Chester County on Monday to help with brush fires.</p><p>Deppen highlighted the same risks before providing some state wildfire statistics, which put Pennsylvania\u2019s 2020 total at 1,508. That\u2019s slightly higher than average, Deppen said, adding that could be because officials are trying to be more proactive with reporting.</p><p>In Deppen\u2019s nine-county region, including Lancaster, there were 105 wildfires in 2020, 59 in 2019 and 67 in 2018, he said, not providing specific dates.</p><p>Over the next few days, it\u2019s likely that the risk of wildfires will decrease, according to forecasters, who predicted cooler, wetter weather.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean dry, windy weather won\u2019t return later this season, Deppen said, encouraging would-be burners to \u201cjust be smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat top leaf litter and the grass is very dry and ready to light. That stuff spreads real quick,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWERA-63a5eaa285d311eb9d876374c9c80a44</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWERA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6274-VNK1-JC8F-237K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222875</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 LNP Media Group, Inc.

The lawsuit against OAN also named two of the network's far-right personalities, Chanel Rion and Christina Bobb, as well as the network's owners, Robert and Charles Herring.</p><p>John Poulos, the chief executive of Dominion, said in a statement that the networks \"disregarded the truth when they spread lies in November\" and that they \"continue to do so today.\"</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election, then-President Trump falsely asserted that the election had been rigged against him.

And in its lawsuit against OAN, Dominion said that for the right-wing channel, \"facts did not matter.\"</p><p>\"What mattered was feeding the audience the alternate reality OAN had helped create and its audience now expected - even if it was spreading false information,\" Dominion said in its 213- complaint in the District of Columbia District Court. \"And the race to the bottom began in earnest, dragging Dominion down with it.\"</p><p>Specifically in regards to OAN, Dominion pointed to a film by MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell that promoted election conspiracy theories about the voting tech company.</p><p>Dominion asked for at least $1.6 billion in each of its lawsuits against OAN and Newsmax. Poulos said that the \"barrage of lies\" promoted about the company has caused \"severe damage to our company, customers, and employees.\"</p><p>In a statement, Newsmax said that it had not yet reviewed the lawsuit filed against it, but that \"in its coverage of the 2020 Presidential elections, Newsmax simply reported on allegations made by well-known public figures, including the President, his advisors and members of Congress.\"</p><p>\"Dominion's action today is a clear attempt to squelch such reporting and undermine a free press,\" Newsmax added.</p><p>Charles Herring, president of OAN, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Dominion also filed a similar defamation lawsuit Tuesday against Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock, who became a right-wing political figure during the Trump years. The lawsuit alleged that he worked with former Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and others to create claims of election fraud. Byrne did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.</p><p>Previously, Dominion filed a $1.6 billion <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/26/media/dominion-voting-systems-fox-news-lawsuit/index.html\">lawsuit</url> against Fox News in March, alleging that the right-wing channel \"took a small flame\" of disinformation and \"turned it into a forest fire.\" That case, in which Fox has vigorously defended itself and filed a motion to dismiss, is ongoing.</p><p>Dominion has also filed lawsuits against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/business/dominion-voting-systems-sues-mypillow-ceo/index.html\">Lindell</url>, Giuliani and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/dominion-voting-defamation-lawsuit/index.html\">Powell.</url> Those cases remain ongoing and Lindell, Giuliani, and Powell have also defended themselves.</p><p>CNN's Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.         </p><p>             By Oliver Darcy, CNN Business         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the Carson National Forest's strategy for managing the Poso fire and to address community concerns. The Carson is asking community members who attend the meeting to practice social distancing and wear a mask if not vaccinated.</p><p>The Poso Fire, the result of a lightning strike, was detected May 29 on the El Rito Ranger District of the Carson National Forest, approximately 10 miles north of the community of El Rito, New Mexico. Currently, the fire is a low-intensity surface fire, burning primarily in the dead-and-down fuels. Carson National Forest fire managers are taking advantage of ideal conditions to manage the fire to meet several resource objectives. This management strategy is designed to help remove hazardous fuels, return fire to the ecosystem, decrease the probability for high-severity wildfires in the future, and reduce exposure to firefighters.</p><p>The decision to not suppress the fire was made after discussions between Carson National Forest leadership, fire managers, resource specialists, and the Forest Service's Southwestern Regional Office. Regard for human safety and management of risk guide all fire management decisions and actions. The Carson National Forest is not \"letting the fire burn,\", rather, fire managers are taking specific actions as the fire reaches trigger points within a pre-determined area that has been outlined for this incident. Management strategies may be reviewed and adjusted as conditions and fire behavior changes. The Poso fire poses no immediate danger to any property or infrastructure.</p><p>Name: Poso</p><p>Date detected: May 29, 2021</p><p>Cause: Lightning</p><p>Location: Carson NF, El Rito Ranger District, 10 miles north of El Rito, adjacent to FR123</p><p>Size: 8 acres</p><p>Growth Potential: Low to moderate</p><p>Vegetation: Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer</p><p>Resources: 1 Type-4 Incident Command Team, 1 type 2 IA crew, 1 road grader, 2 Type-6 engines, local fire personnel.</p><p>In Route: 1 Type-2 bulldozer, 1 Type-1 masticator, and 1 wildland fire module.</p><p>Smoke: Smoke management is a key part of the planning and implementation of managed wildfire. Due to the location and elevation of the fires, smoke may be visible from surrounding communities including Vallecitos, Canon Plaza, Petaca, Las Tablas, Servilleta Plaza, El Rito, Ojo Caliente, Tres Piedras, and La Madera, New Mexico.

But the village did not suffer major damage. <br/>Other fire breaks were established in the villages of villages de Kamaria and Kastaniotissa, ANA reported. <br/>The fire department late on Monday said that over 650 firefighters were still deployed in Evia, including forces from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia. <br/>Hundreds of homes have been lost in Evia, greater Athens, the Peloponnese and other parts of Greece in wildfires that have been raging almost without pause since late July. <br/>There was still concern Tuesday about three separate fires in the Peloponnese peninsula, where villages were still without electricity and water according to local officials. <br/>Over 400 firefighters were active in the area, including reinforcements from the Czech Republic and Britain. <br/>EU states and other countries have so far contributed 21 aircraft, 250 vehicles and over 1,200 firefighters, some of whom were expected between Tuesday and Friday, the civil protection authority said. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162858875044425979100080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BF-X491-JCMN-Y48Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"545\"/><timeReceived>9:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 10, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The girls section was filled with gendered stereotypes to carefully cultivate a new generation of domesticated women through marketing: Instead of Lego sets, we were offered baby dolls that needed to be \"mothered\" by us with mock baby bottles and diapers; instead of Nerf guns, we were gifted Easy-Bake Ovens that introduced us early on to the concepts of cooking and baking; instead of Pok\u00e9mon cards, we got to browse an assortment of plastic Barbie dolls who modeled how to girl-boss through women-dominated fields of life while perfectly maintaining Eurocentric standards of beauty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Concealed behind fuchsia plastic was the societal goal to slowly condition a generation of young girls to collectively understand our \"proper place\" in the world without asking any questions. While the boys got to be boys, the girls were fed discreet corporate messages about their predetermined roles in society.</p><p>While sex concerns the biological differences between females and males, gender is much more complex. According to ??Dr. Zuleyka Zevallos, a Peruvian-Australian applied sociologist, gender is \"a concept that describes how societies determine and manage sex categories; the cultural meanings attached to men and women's roles; and how individuals understand their identities.\" Gender, she explains, \"involves social norms, attitudes and activities that society deems more appropriate for one sex over another.\" She adds that gender is further determined by \"what an individual feels and does.\"</p><p>How you comprehend gender drastically changes the meaning of the word to you. On the one hand, gender is a socially constructed concept designed to inform each sex of their respective roles in society, thus confining each gender to specific definitions of acceptability. On the other hand, gender is an intimate experience: an intangible feeling inside each person, unique to each individual's understanding of themselves and, by extension, incapable of being relegated to antiquated color associations or policed in any way.</p><p>Many cisgender people never fully challenge or even contemplate their assigned gender because their gender identity is adequately communicated through the labels of \"woman,\" \"man,\" \"girl\" or \"boy.\" I used to think that \"woman\" was an appropriate summation of who I was. But when I turned 18 years old, for the first time the confinement of \"woman\" that I had been placed within since birth began to make me feel claustrophobic. Of course I still resonated with the collective struggles and experiences of women: frequent catcalls on the streets, being condescended upon by male peers and, of course, feeling coerced to cater to male standards of beauty. But \"woman\" felt grossly two-dimensional and overly simplistic. \"Woman\" no longer described the nuance or ambiguity of my gender identity.</p><p>For a while, I distanced myself entirely from the label of \"woman.\" I barred my friends and family from calling me a woman and began to use they/she pronouns, placing an asterisk beside my feminine-presenting self as if to communicate: \"I am a feminine being, but I am so much more than a woman.\" But I overlooked the most important element of gender identity: Gender, as previously mentioned, is a unique and individual experience belonging to each person. So instead of asking myself if I felt like a woman, I started asking myself what \"woman\" means to me.</p><p>Being a woman extends far beyond the gendered binary that has been prescribed to females for centuries. No, being a woman is not inferiority to men or confinement to the home performing uncompensated labor, as colonialism introduced to the world in the 15th through 18th centuries. No, being a woman is not measured by how pious, pure, submissive or domesticated you are, which was the litmus test for womanhood in the 19th and 20th centuries thanks to the sexist ideas spread by The Cult of Domesticity. And no, being a woman is not even girl-bossing through male-dominated industries and making millions of dollars, despite all odds. No. In order to truly define womanhood for ourselves, we must ditch the preconceived notions of womanhood that were forced onto women by a patriarchal society.</p><p>A recent trend I've found in my TikTok feed is users who use non-gendered objects as a means of symbolizing their personal gender identity. One user compared their gender to a capybara eating an orange. One compared their gender to a potato. For cisgender people, this may be falsely interpreted as a joke because it seems so absurd. But this seemingly humorous TikTok trend is exactly how gender identity should work: The ambiguity of gender identity can only be captured with symbolic, non-gendered objects because the very concept of gender is deeply abstract and conceptual. And it is with these entities that I can understand the nature of my womanhood.</p><p>For me, being a woman is inextricably linked with nature. Women are like water, the life source for all humanity with the looming power to take it all away. The ferociousness of waves in a storm, the soft pitter-patter of raindrops landing on leaves, the peacefulness of a still lake: This is what being a woman means to me.</p><p>Flowers blooming with an explosion of mustard yellow across the rolling hills of Santa Cruz, Calif. A raspberry lemonade. Lying in the sun. Taking a nap. The beautiful, ethereal sounds of a harp. Willow trees. A forest fire (Thank you, Mitski). The wind, the sky and the clouds. Eucalyptus, lavender, jasmine. Sequoia trees and all of their wisdom. Callused feet. Stretch marks and curls. A barbaric yawp. This is what being a woman means to me.</p><p>Gender identity is a transcendental inner voice and feeling and can be mystical and spiritual. Gender identity is not something that can be vastly assigned to the entirety of humanity or policed by ridiculous rules to delegate the \"acceptability\" of people's personal experience with gender. Rather, gender identity is something to explore and to reflect upon over time. It belongs to you and you alone. It is time for us to advance beyond the dated notions of men and women and begin exploring our identities as unique experiences for each person. It is only when we break these societal shackles that we will finally be able to exist freely, as we are.</p><p>Sophia Lehrbaum is an Opinion Columnist and can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:lehrbaum@umich.edu\">lehrbaum@umich.edu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5329868</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PD-48D1-DY7P-T3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Michigan Daily: University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 15, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ann Arbor</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CMP5</classCode><className>INFANTS &amp; TODDLERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL65</classCode><className>GENDER IDENTITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00098X6</classCode><className>SEX &amp; GENDER ISSUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DS8C</classCode><className>CISGENDER PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009SCB</classCode><className>SOCIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000154</classCode><className>BABY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DS8Y</classCode><className>DIAPERS &amp; INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS138</classCode><className>MICHIGAN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In the event of a brush fire or forest fire, nearby wine grapes that are exposed to smoke for extended time periods will store those aroma compounds and contaminate the final product.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During prolonged periods of smoke exposure, wine grapes can absorb those compounds and attach sugars to them in a detoxification process. But when those grapes are vinified later, the sugars are separated from the accumulated compounds by the yeast used in fermentation. What seemed like perfectly fine grapes are turned into wine that smells like smoke.</p><p>Researchers like Dr. Gavin Sacks, a professor of food science at Cornell University, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> that while smoke taint is a well-documented problem, the same can't be said for gasoline emissions.</p><p>At Cornell's viticulture and enology department, Sacks' research looks at how outside forces shape the flavor and aroma of the final product. He said that there's no data available to suggest that gasoline emissions are causing any noticeable difference in how wine grapes ferment.</p><p>Automotive exhaust isn't as concentrated in the environment for very long, so it's unlikely that there's a similar effect.</p><p>\"The difference is that when you've got smoke taint, you have long periods where grapes are being exposed to very high concentrations of these compounds in the vineyard,\" he explained. \"As opposed to a tractor going through the vineyard, there might be momentary exposure but it's going to dissipate quickly in the environment due to mixing.\"</p><p>As the automotive industry prepares for an electric future though, special attention is being paid to commercial operations like vineyards.</p><p>Last month, in California wine country, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ford?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Ford</url> announced a pilot partnership with a group of Sonoma County winegrowers to test the mettle of its newest electric vehicles (EVs), the 2022 Ford E-Transit and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/no-electricity-ford-f-150-lighting-can-power-house-10-days-1676841?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">2022 Ford F-150 Lightning</url>.</p><p>Over the course of a year, three winemakers in the region will utilize these vehicles - along with Ford Pro's suite of telematics and charging solutions for commercial customers - to show that the company is going all in on commercial sustainability.</p><p>Ford estimates that the use of EVs and the cloud-based software will reduce the cost of fleet ownership by up to 20 percent.</p><p>Winemakers have touted the possibilities of strengthening their sustainability missions and being able to perform tasks that would be off-limits to gasoline-powered vehicles.</p><p>For example, an E-Transit can be driven through a wine cave or cellar, where California regulations prevent an internal combustion engine from doing the same. An F-150 Lightning, with its charging capabilities, can be brought into the field to charge another vehicle or piece of equipment.</p><p>But can it also make grapes cleaner?</p><p>During a Ford presentation at Inglenook estate winery in Rutherford, California, associate winemaker Chris Phelps brought up the potential issue, referencing studies done in previous decades that showed increased lead content in wine until leaded gasoline was banned in the 90s.</p><p>\"In the pre-unleaded years, they found that lead was actually making it into the grapes right along the highway,\" he said. \"We finally went to unleaded gas, but now we can take it a step farther going electric. We can do away with those emissions. We can take care of our fruit and make super premium wines.\"</p><p>Sacks and a group of researchers are starting to look into more \"environmentally derived taints,\" like smoke or methane. They're also looking at asphalt, but not car exhaust.</p><p>But Sacks thinks that if taint from car exhaust is happening, it's subtle enough to where nobody is noticing it.</p><p>\"It's a small portion of the vineyard that's going to be affected,\" he argued. \"Whatever's closest to the road or downwind of the road. And that means it can be averaged out when you harvest an entire vineyard. Unless you're making wines from very small, separate blocks within the vineyard you wouldn't notice that.\"</p><p>Phelps told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> that while he doesn't know the current effect that gasoline emissions have on grapes, he'd rather switch to electric before finding out.</p><p>\"We know that if they're exposed to smoke from a fire, they're harmed,\" he said. \"There's nothing good about emissions. So no emissions, no questions.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1986520/ford-f-150-lightning-pro.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ford F-150 Lightning Pro</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Ford Motor Company</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A Ford F-150 Lightning Pro edition drives through a winery in Sonoma County, California.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-1679523</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64T0-8761-JBR6-912M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2022 Newsweek Inc.

The military announced it would increase its involvement in firefighting and prevention, with ground and air patrols in areas vulnerable to wildfires. At least three significant fires were burning, on the island of Evia, in southern Greece and on the outskirts of Athens where a major forest blaze rekindled, as well as dozens of smaller ones. </p><p>No deaths or severe injuries have been reported, but there has been widespread destruction to buildings and to Greece's quick-shrinking forests. \"The country is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis\" with multiple fires fueled by a heat wave entering its second week,\" said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, visiting the site of the blaze in southern Greece that had threatened ancient Olympia, where the Olympics were held every four years from 776 B.C. for more than a millennium. More difficult days lie ahead, he said, as winds have been predicted to pick up and the heat wave continues. \"I fully understand the anger, rage, exasperation of people who have seen their property lost,\" Mitsotakis added. The prime minister said ancient Olympia's archaeological site and museum had been successfully protected. Citizens Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoidis said earlier that firefighters waged \"an all-night battle\" to save the site. \"We will continue the battle all day in order to contain all the fronts and extinguish the fire. The conditions are difficult,\" Chrisochoidis said. Wildfires in the same area in 2007 killed dozens of people but spared Olympia's ancient sports venues and temples. The fire department said 174 firefighters, nine ground teams, 52 vehicles, two water-dropping planes and four helicopters were tackling the blaze, which broke out yesterday. Evacuation orders were issued for more than a dozen villages. On the northern fringes of the Greek capital, a forest fire that had been on the wane after burning into a suburb Tuesday rekindled, sending plumes of thick smoke into the sky, and fire trucks racing to the area, sirens blaring. The fire in the Athens suburb of Varibobi had damaged dozens of homes and sent thousands fleeing earlier in the week, but had no longer been threatening inhabited areas. Authorities sent text messages to cellphones in the area urging people to evacuate. A heat wave described as Greece's worst since 1987 has baked the country for more than a week, sending temperatures spiraling to 113 degrees Fahrenheit and creating tinder-dry conditions in scrubland and forests. Neighboring countries face similar conditions, fueling deadly wildfires in Turkey and blazes in Italy and across the Mediterranean region. Officials in Albania said one person died of smoke inhalation this week near the southern city of Gjirokast\u00c3\u00abr. In Turkey, a wildfire that reached the compound of a coal-fueled power plant in the southwest, forcing residents to flee in boats and cars late yesterday, was contained today after raging for some 11 hours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b166bd5d7a1ff36eb8c830000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63HD-WC41-JBSK-R46P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 5, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Most commonly known as drones, they have been used since the 1900s, initially by the US military for target practice.</p><p>Military applications still dominate the global UAV market, but the achievements of UAVs in military operations have boosted demand for drones in North America, Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. UAVs are becoming a key element in the intelligence and surveillance operations of military and fast expanding in other combative areas as well.</p><p>The fast development of the UAV global market is having a big impact on a range of mainstream industries. Apart from defense, applications also include environmental management, crisis management, agriculture, policing and crowd monitoring, civil engineering, fisheries protection, disaster management, telecommunications maintenance, oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, mine safety, geophysical surveys and mapping.</p><p>The UAV market has traditionally been narrowly focused, but it is rapidly diversifying. Given the pace at which technology and the effectiveness of aircraft are improving, and as sensor and automation technologies mature, commercial applications will rapidly grow over the next ten years.</p><p>1.2 Market Scope</p><p>The UAV sector is set to be the sector with the most dynamic growth in the aerospace industry globally in this decade. According to the Teal Group, global spending on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs is expected to more than triple over the next decade in military, commercial, and consumer markets.</p><p>In light of solid growth rates, the Teal Group forecasts global spending is expected to touch $20.3 billion by 2025. The civil UAS market is expected to grow faster than the military market over the next decade. The worldwide military UAS spending over the next decade is estimated to be US$216.5 billion. Of which, procurement spending will amount to US$162.2 billion and research spending will amount to US$72.5 billion. The US is expected to account for about 81% of the total military R&amp;D spending and about 48% of military procurement through to 2030.</p><p>The high level of military R&amp;D spending is forecast to be due to the bigger and higher-value systems procured by the US. The military UAS market growth will be led by unmanned combat aerial vehicles and high-altitude long endurance UAVs. The largest market segment over the next decade will be High Altitude Long Endurance UAVs, which will account for a third of the period's sales.</p><p>The civil UAS will be the most attractive market this decade as commercial applications take off and governments adopt UAVs for new roles in border security and public safety. The worldwide civil UAS market is expected to reach US$19.8 billion by 2031, from US$7.2 billion in 2022, according to the Teal Group. Over the coming decade, the civil market will grow at a CAGR of 9.1% and will generate US$139 billion in revenues. Civil UAS promises to be the most dynamic growth sector with the commercial segment expected to lead the growth.</p><p>The worldwide commercial UAS market is projected to reach $9.5 billion by 2028. Delivery is likely to emerge as the leading sector for commercial UAS market in the US by 2030. Teal Group predicts that Teal growth opportunities will be in middle-mile (e.g., factory to warehouse) transportation, rather than in the last-mile deliveries. This is primarily due to the complexities involved in regulating the last-mile deliveries, while the regulatory framework for middle-mile transportation is already in place. Globally, Agriculture will be the largest sector by 2030 led by more affordable UAS and heavy Chinese investments. This is also supported by UN projections which suggest the world's population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, causing significant growth in agricultural consumption. Another key sector that will drive growth of the commercial UAS market is Industrial Inspection. Construction will be the largest portion of the Industrial Inspection market. All ten of the largest worldwide construction firms are deploying or experimenting with UAS fleets.</p><p>China has a clear leadership in the consumer UAS manufacturing and is now seeking to expand its capabilities to commercial UAS manufacturing. The aggressive growth of the UAV industry in China is attributable to the policy and regulatory support as well as significant investments from the Chinese government.</p><p>Currently, Sichuan, Hunan, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces in China are pushing forward the reform of low-altitude airspace management, giving support to the commercialization of drone application. China's civil drone market is estimated at $6.6 billion in 2022, according to Shenzhen-based research firm AskCI Consulting. The industrial drone market is also witnessing rapid growth. According to data from Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute, the industrial drone sales is projected to increase from 27.3 billion yuan in 2020 to 265.8 billion yuan in 2026. Shenzhen has more than 1,500 drone companies with civilian UAV business licenses.</p><p>Data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China showed that by the end of 2021, there are 781,000 registered drone users, and the number of registered drones totaled 832,000 in China. The Civil Aviation Administration of China released a plan that outlined several targets for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) business in China by the years 2025, 2030, and 2035. These goals included the enhancement of rules and the expansion of airspace capacity for civilian UAVs.</p><p>Europe has fallen behind in the civil UAS market. It is now trying to catch up by enacting standardized airspace rules that will create a single market. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established rules for small UAS across the European Union.</p><p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has become the first air transport safety regulator in the world to offer technical design guidance to urban planners and eVTOL manufacturers looking to build drone taxi vertiports across Europe. Europe also adopted 'European Drone Strategy 2.0' late last year aimed for the further development of the European drone market. Further, the implementation of the 'U-space' in January 2023, a European system to manage drone traffic safely, will lay the ground for increased operations. According to the European Commission, the drone services market in Europe could be worth \u20ac14.5 billion, and create 145,000 jobs, by 2030.</p><p>The increase in defense spending by various countries to strengthen their defense forces is leading to growth in the number of military UAV systems. These UAV systems are being used for applications such as surveying, mapping, transportation, combat operations and monitoring. The US and European governments have already begun new programs using UAVs for protecting land and sea borders. Many other international agencies including the UN and other peacekeeping agencies are also deploying unmanned aerial protection systems.</p><p>According to the US Presidential budget for fiscal 2024, the US Department of Defense aims to hasten the deployment of advanced combat drones as part of a broader push to modernize the force and pursue cutting-edge technology. The US Air Force wants $5.8 billion to build 1,000 AI-driven unmanned combat aircraft, possibly more, as part of its next generation air dominance initiative. The autonomous aircraft are ideal for completing suicide missions and protecting pilots. The United States is not the only nation that is increasing defense spending on unmanned aerial vehicles. Earlier this year, Germany approved major uptick in defense spending on armed drones. German military will purchase ammunitions worth EUR152 million to arm German drones. This will be the first deployment of weaponized UAVs in German military.</p><p>Ukraine has announced plans to double down on its deployment of drones in its efforts to counter Russian forces, pledging nearly $540 million of spending in 2023 for the production and procurement of UAVs.</p><p>Japan has announced a record $40.7 billion defense budget for fiscal 2023, which will include significant spending on armed drones. It intends to raise defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2027. The Japanese defense ministry aims to introduce unmanned vehicles that can be used directly in combat, rather than just for surveillance and intelligence gathering.</p><p>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), military expenditures are on the rise around the globe. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to increase in defense funding especially for drones. Over the next decade, growth in the military market will increasingly shift towards international markets as more militaries incorporate UAVs into their forces.</p><p>Major drone providers from China and Israel have increased the manufacture and export of defense drones for foreign militaries. Many counties from Saudi Arabia to Myanmar and Iraq to Ethiopia, are stockpiling Chinese combat drones and deploying them on the battlefield. Recently in August 2023, Indonesia announced plans to buy 12 Turkish military drones for $300 million.</p><p>The introduction of specially built unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) also promises to drive growth over the next decade. The emergence of the commercial UAS market, growing demand from governments to better patrol borders, and continued consumer drone growth all promise to drive more than a quadrupling of the non-military market over the next decade.</p><p>With increasing UAV installations across the globe, there is rising need to defend against such systems as well. In May 2022, South Korea approved a project to install uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) defense systems at 45 bases across the nation to neutralize hostile drones. South Korean government will spend NT$4.3 billion (US$144.45 million) to purchase the UAV defense systems.</p><p>Market Share</p><p>The world UAV sector is highly concentrated with a small number of companies holding most of the market share compared to other industries. Our estimates show there are more than 500 companies globally, with more than 200 commercial UAV companies, while the other 300 develop UAV for the military industry. AeroVironment, BAE Systems, Elbit Systems, Finmeccanica, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Navmar Applied Sciences, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Textron, Thales, Boeing, Tital Aerospace, TAI, AIA and Aviation Industry Corporation of China are among the biggest players in the UAV market.</p><p>A number of start-ups have made their mark on the market in recent years, however, and are challenging the dominance of the incumbent players. Technology companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple as well as venture capitalists have poured more millions of dollars into startup investments.</p><p>Impact of COVID-19 on the UAV Sector</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every industry, although not in an equal way. Some industries have felt the impact very differently to others. The effect on the UAV market especially commercial drones have been on the positive side. According to Drone Industry Insights, drone companies are on a path towards steady growth over the next many years. Global drone market size is forecast to reach US$55.8 billion by 2030, from US$30.6 billion in 2022, implying a CAGR of 7.8%. The services sector will remain the biggest segment, while the hardware segment will be the fastest growing.</p><p>As the global economies were forced to shut down and implement strict shelter-in-place restrictions, the demand for unmanned aerial systems became higher. Further, the use of drones for transporting medical supplies proved a boon for the sector. Cargo, courier and warehousing are the sectors with the fastest adoption of drones. Many drone companies including Wingcopter, Zipline and Wing have been able to deliver and scale their solutions quicker than previously expected.</p><p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is among those trailing the vehicles to deliver fragile medicines to cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight. Chemotherapy drugs can have short shelf lives and thus quick delivery by drones is a boon for patients.</p><p>Walmart said that it completed 6,000 drone deliveries in 2022 from 36 US stores in seven states. These deliveries were done from drone delivery hubs operated by DroneUp, Flytrex and Zipline. Walmart has 4,700 stores located within 90% of the US population making it uniquely positioned to offer drone delivery at scale.</p><p>In June 2022, Zipline launched drone medical deliveries in Nigeria. Zipline will initially deliver over 200 different medical products, including medicines and vaccines, with plans to expand in the near future. This will enable Nigeria to create a strong and smart health system. In May 2022, Wingcopter announced a partnership with Continental Drones to develop a massive delivery network spanning 49 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The deal aims to deploy 12,000 of Wingcopter's 198 drone systems over the course of the next 5 years. In February 2022, Zipline announced launching operations in another African Nation with on-demand drone deliveries of medical supplies in Kenya. The company is already operating in Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.</p><p>US-based Walgreens in partnership with Alphabet's Wing is targeting the drone delivery market. In April 2022, Walgreens announced that it will begin flying packages by drone to residents of Texas cities in partnership with Google's drone subsidiary, Wing.</p><p>US-based Matternet is another player targeting the medical delivery market. In September 2021, it launched the world's first city-wide drone delivery network for the rapid transport of medical goods in Abu Dhabi. The company will use drones to transport urgent, high-value goods such as COVID-19 vaccines, blood, and lab samples across the Abu Dhabi's health system.</p><p>LEK Consulting notes that drones could account for a large portion of package delivery market by 2040. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rapid and more expansive testing of drone delivery systems. Technology has been able to accelerate its growth and development over the past 12 months or so.</p><p>To further assist the sector, the UK government announced a new funding program for drone companies developing methods to deliver COVID-19 tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospitals and rural communities. The government has announced ~\u00a37 million funding package for the sector.</p><p>According to research published in journal Patterns, drone deliveries could help reduce greenhouse emissions significantly. The paper states that greenhouse-gas emissions per parcel were 84% lower for drones than for diesel trucks. Companies such as Amazon have been testing the use of drones to deliver packages with an eye to reducing their environmental impact.</p><p>1.3 Market Trends</p><p>Start-ups Threaten Larger Incumbents</p><p>Over the past 20 years, the UAV sector has expanded and opened up to a whole new level of competition and innovation that had not been seen in the market. While large incumbents, especially the Big Three - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman - have won a big slice of the available UAV deals, new and smaller entrants are increasingly winning against the big companies for UAV contracts, thus challenging their respective market positions.</p><p>A number of smaller start-up companies have burst onto the scene in recent years, threatening the market positions of the larger incumbents. Non-defense companies eager to diversify and get a slice of the fast-growing market have funded some start-ups.</p><p>The funding from Drone startups have started on a strong footing in 2023 after a robust 2022. In June 2023, defense and security UAV specialist group Red Cat Holdings raised $1.2 million in new funding to develop a new, portable UAV as standard issue equipment for soldiers. In April 2023, San Francisco-based Zipline raised $330 million at about $4.2 billion, a 55% increase from its $2.7 billion valuation reached two years ago. The funding will help the company to carry out its expansion activities. In March 2023, French advanced air mobility (AAM) startup Ascendance Flight Technology says it is aggressively pushing to finalize the prototype of its ATEA hybrid vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) plane and has raised new investment of \u20ac21 million ($22.6 million). In February 2023, US-based drone manufacturer, Skydio raised $230 million in Series E funding at a valuation of $2.2 billion. The funding will be used to set up a new manufacturing facility in America. In January 2023, Japan-based Terra Drone raised $14 million from oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company says it will utilize the funding to set up a new subsidiary for inspection services in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In November 2022, India-based drone delivery platform Skye Air Mobility raised $1.7 million. Skye Air Mobility is currently operating in eight cities across India and plans to expand to 16 cities in the next 24 months. In October 2022, Australian drone logistics service provider Swoop Aero landed a new investment round for its first and last mile airborne delivery network, bringing its total backing to $26 million to date. Swoop Aero plans to use the funds to enter new markets, scale its integrated logistics networks, and expand its manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>Regulatory Uncertainties Overshadow the Segment</p><p>UAV vehicles have evolved swiftly in recent years, particularly since making the leap from military technology to consumer gadgetry. The technology they use could be useful for myriad business opportunities. For example, UAVs are being used in many sectors, like the agriculture, construction, energy, mining and entertainment, as well as geological surveys and, utility safety and maintenance, thanks to their ability to shoot aerial photos and video, as well as collect other data cheaply.</p><p>The growth of the UAV market, however, has drawn considerable attention from regulators and legislators eager to mitigate the complexities involved in the growth of the number of aeronautical vehicles in the skies. For instance, in the US there have been delays and confusion regarding the rules set by FAA. With the courts and Congress getting involved in regulation, clarity around the regulatory landscape is yet to emerge.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued new rules for the commercial drone industry. Under the new rules, the FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. The new rules went into effect on 21 April 2021. Remote ID will be required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more. Remote ID requires identification of drones in flight as well as the location of their control stations or takeoff point.</p><p>Further, in 2022, the FAA will require every newly produced drone weighing over 0.55 pounds to broadcast its location. In 2023, it will be illegal to fly drone without this broadcasting capability.</p><p>For fiscal FY 2022, FAA is requesting a total of over $100 million in funding for unmanned aircraft system (UAS) research, development, and integration. This includes $31.3 million for UAS implementation which incorporates FAA Drone Zone. The FAA Drone Zone is a cloud-based information technology platform that includes a UAS registration system, Part 107 authorizations and optional waivers, and UAS accident reporting.</p><p>FAA budget request also includes $24 million for UAS concept validation and requirements development, UAS flight information management, and urban air mobility.</p><p>The FAA plans to launch field tests of unmanned aircraft traffic management capabilities. The Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) field test, which is set to launch in the spring 2022 and continue into 2023, is expected to lead to new policies and the development of updated industry standards for drones operating beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS).</p><p>The commercial potential of UAV continues to attract big investors and venture capital. For example, Amazon's is investing in its Amazon Prime Air program to create a delivery system utilizing UAVs.</p><p>Alphabet's drone-delivery subsidiary Wing launched a new mobile and web app, OpenSky, which is free to use and informs drone pilots about airspace restrictions, pre-plan flights, and get airspace approvals. Drone flyers can also use the app to check information on areas where they can and cannot fly.</p><p>This is just one of the many proposed uses for UAVs, however. Within the next ten years, it is expected that more than 32,000 drones will be flying for commercial operations worldwide. FAA projects that remote pilot certificates could grow almost 3x to 350,000 over the next five years.</p><p>For the US, the potential economic impact of UAVs, according to the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, could reach approximately US$13.7 billion within the next three years and create more than 100,000 employment opportunities once the FAA drafts comprehensive drone regulations.</p><p>Despite some progress by FAA on establishing rules, it remains unclear. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) delivered a report in January 2023 stating the need for FAA to more clearly communicate a strategy to integrate drones into the airspace. GAO notes that commercial drone use is likely to expand to 858,000 in 2026 from 622,000 in 2021.</p><p>The main conclusions of the report are that FAA needs to do better in both establishing and communicating a comprehensive strategy for broader UAV use, and in defining a uniform procedure for issuing waiver.</p><p>Wing's CEO Adam Woodwort in March 2023 reiterated the need to make drone regulations more pragmatic and predictable. He emphasized the need for drone regulations that support commercial operations. He noted that many of the current regulations make sense for passenger-carrying airplanes, but not for small aircraft with no people onboard.</p><p>In June 2023, China unveiled a list of new rules applying to drone flight by civilian users and these rules are set to come into force next year. The regulations ban people from using the devices to take pictures or video of military or defence industrial installations or secretive facilities. Drones cannot be used to gather and publish state secrets or unlawfully transfer information outside mainland China. It also bans non-Chinese drones and pilots who are not Chinese nationals from using the vehicles for surveying land. The country currently has a million registered civilian drones that fly around 20 million hours each year, according to data from China Daily.</p><p>The Buzz from Parcel-Toting Drones</p><p>In a few decades from now, we may look back and remember a time before flying robots delivered consumer orders. At least this might be the case if delivery drones turn out the way most retailers \u2014 as well as service providers - envision them. A delivery drone, or also known as a parcelcopter, is an UAV utilized to transport goods, packages, and foodstuffs, and recently, the delivery systems have been a hot future state plans among vendors.</p><p>By 2023, Statista projects global drone delivery market to touch $1.6 billion. Asia-Pacific will be the largest market accounting for nearly 39% of the total, followed by North America (31%) and Europe (22%).</p><p>The enthusiasm for drone delivery space is visible in the funding so far in 2023. In the first half of 2023, drone delivery startups have raised nearly $1.5 billion, almost equal to the figure for the full year 2022, according to data from Crunchbase. Zipline topped the list of drone delivery related companies with a total funding of $813 million in the first half of 2023.</p><p>Drone Industry Insights noted that services such as cargo, courier, intralogistics and warehousing were the fastest-growing drone market in 2021 and are likely to continue to remain so till 2026 with a CAGR of 24.3%. This is due to the increased popularity and demand of drone deliveries for both internal (intralogistics and warehousing) as well as external services.</p><p>Drone deliveries can cut emissions and reduce congestion on roads. According to Virginia Tech University, drone delivery could save the average consumer up to 56 hours per year, reduce vehicle traffic by 294 million miles per year and displace up to 113,900 tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>China-based ecommerce platform Meituan announced that it has completed more than 100,000 drone deliveries by 2022, an increase of more than 400% year-on-year. The company expects a greater number of drone deliveries going forward.</p><p>Alphabet's drone delivery service Wing is adding complex route management and self-loading capability for its drone delivery fleet that will make it capable of handling tens of millions of deliveries for millions of consumers by mid 2024.</p><p>Given the large opportunity in the drone delivery market, the space is witnessing new entrants. In 2023, Japan Post announced its plans to expand and accelerate its mail drone delivery services in the country. It is now undertaking trials in populated zones in the country.</p><p>Singapore's civil aviation authority and transport ministry has chosen a private consortium of 13 members to develop the drone program. Under this program, the aim is to use drones for tasks that include delivering parcels, inspecting buildings and providing security. The companies involved in the project have carried our various pilots. These include drone parcel delivery as well as using drones to transport blood samples and specimens between hospitals and central laboratories. Drones are being tested for delivering parts and other materials to factories as well.</p><p>China is not too far behind in this race. DHL in partnership with China-based drone company EHang has launched drone delivery service in China. JD.com and Alibaba have tested the drone delivery system as well.</p><p>Putting the parcelcopter concept into service will take some time because of the many setbacks. The major setback for this concept in the US is that there is no specific flight system where there needs to be a specific path for the drone to travel and deliver in a populated area - and this needs to be solved. Once resolved, the big benefit should be that these delivery-by-drone systems could be commonplace within the next decade. Open season on the open skies could arrive sooner than expected.</p><p>The Obsession with Armed Flying Robots</p><p>The use of a UAV as a weapon first became known in World War II. After the war, little development occurred in drone technology and most remotely piloted vehicles were used for target practice. The US military's first major spending on UAVs began after the Vietnam War, and over the past two decades, the country has become the world's pre-eminent user and supplier.</p><p>Military UAVs in the US have gone through meteoric growth over the past decade. Development has taken a quantum leap \u2014 from lab concept to battle-tested proven technology. Today, America's comparative advantage in UAVs, however, is being battered as technological know-how disseminates throughout the international system. While existing technology has started to lag, global competitors are playing catch up in research and development for drone technology.</p><p>As such, the Pentagon is expected to ramp up its investment in unmanned aerial vehicles in the coming years. The US Defense Department budget request for fiscal year 2023 mentions that unmanned weapons systems, such as drone ships, planes, and ground vehicles, will play an increasing role in future US military planning. The president's fiscal year 2023 defense budget requests new spending on unmanned/autonomous systems technology.</p><p>The Air Force request includes $187 million for enhancements to the MQ-9 Reaper combat drone and $111 million for work on the MQ-4C Triton high-altitude surveillance drone. The Navy and Marine Corps have also requested additional funding for UAVs. The Navy requested $1.2 billion for the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which is to be deployed on carriers and perform aerial refueling and surveillance functions.</p><p>No country has ramped up its UAV research in recent years faster than China, where every major company for the Chinese military has a research and development center and funding allocations dedicated to drones. In recent years, the country has pumped considerable amounts of funds and engineering brainpower into the technology, a field previously dominated by the US and Israel.</p><p>Much of the work done, however, remains secret, but the large number of drones created underlines not only the country's willpower to catch up in the sector by building comparable combat and surveillance models like the Predator and the Global Hawk but also the desire to trade the technologies globally. Its armed UAV CH-4, Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II have been rapidly gaining market share especially in developing countries such as Nigeria, Jordan, Algeria and Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>Israel, second after the US in drone technology, has flown armed UAV models but few details are available. India has also revealed its intention to develop drones that will fire missiles and fly at 30,000 feet, followed by Russia, which has revealed models of UAVs with weapons (although there is little evidence that they are currently operational).</p><p>The Lucrative UAV Micro Segment</p><p>The new generation of UAVs is being developed to improve monitoring of many kinds of systems. From tracking bush fires in Australia to observing traffic in the US, infrared cameras to track missing people at night, and laser spectroscopy used to monitor air pollutions, UAVs are using a lot of the new up-to-date miniature sensor technology.</p><p>All of this requires more focus on the integration of sensor systems in an airborne device that is severely constrained in power and weight. Changing the sensor architecture or even take the control sensors out entirely, allowing the size of the UAV to reduce dramatically. This has created a new class of ultra-small UAV sensors.</p><p>Lockheed Martin's Lockheed Sanders MicroSTAR series of prototypes is one of the many examples of a mini-UAV. The battery-operated MicroSTAR designs resembled kid's toys. The device has winglets instead of the single vertical plane tail, and a nose mounted propeller. MicroSTAR featured a five-gram navigation system that could give directions by the ground station but could also automatically keep on a heading or orbit a target.</p><p>The US army has been using mini UAVs for mission in Afghanistan and other areas. These mini-UAVs provide near-real time video that allows soldiers to better survey their surroundings and detect enemies in combat. FLIR System's Black Hornet is one such mini-UAV which weighs less than two ounces, can be deployed in less than one minute and has a range of over a mile. It is intended to eliminate battlefield blind spots thereby saving lives.</p><p>French drone maker Parrot is also an established player in micro-UAV space. It has been selected by Swiss army to develop and supply micro-drones as part of the Swiss Mini UAV Program.</p><p>Despite the advancements, the current micro-UAV market remains constrained, largely due to regulatory frameworks on unmanned operations in airspace. But once regulatory restraints are loosened and clarified, the potential of this technology will be unlocked. Mini UAVs are set to become one of the major contributors to both the economy and technology. Market growth, however, still very much depends on the pace of UAV development in different countries, thanks to the wide range of applications and the added value related to these unmanned machines.</p><p>1.4 Applications</p><p>Defense</p><p>Defense will continue to the largest market for UAVs for the foreseeable future. UAVs can play an important role in counter terrorism and counter insurgency activities. They can be deployed in highly dangerous missions thereby saving personnel lives. The UAVs are also being used in difficult terrains for intelligence gathering and surveillance. They provide high resolution images and videos which can significantly help ground troops. Drones have been used by militaries of many countries to conduct strikes against terrorists.</p><p>Transport</p><p>UAVs are increasingly used in transport activities such as e-commerce parcel delivery, food delivery and medicine delivery. Of these, e-commerce delivery is getting the maximum attention with large companies such as Amazon already doing pilot tests.</p><p>Another promising area for UAVs is the delivery of food. It could be used in heavily populated urban areas for food delivery by restaurants and also could be used to deliver foods to difficult terrains including oil rigs and remote islands. Medical logistics is another area where UAVs can be used to transport medicines and can also be used as flying defibrillators.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>UAVs can assist in the management of various kinds of infrastructure, specifically construction sites. In the pre- construction phase, drones can survey the land and provide accurate field data and images. They are able to capture high-resolution videos and images, which can significantly improve the speed and quality of the design process. In the construction phase, drones can inspect the sites and provide accurate information regarding the progress of the construction.</p><p>The data received could be used by investors and property owners to monitor if the project is progressing as per original schedule or not. Abu Dhabi has launched the trial stage of implementing drones as aerial monitoring and inspection tools for the city's engineering projects and construction sites.</p><p>US state of Arizona is mulling the use drones to inspect roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The state has introduced Drone Infrastructure Inspection Grant Act, that would dispense about $200 million to purchase drones and the other half to train pilots to fly them.</p><p>The FAA's rollout of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) has helped standardize and expand the use of drones in construction. LAANC automates the application and approval process for airspace authorizations and is currently available near 500 airports across the country. LAANC is currently in beta and will be tested further before nationwide rollout.</p><p>An increasing number of construction firms and real estate developers in the Middle East are turning to drones amid the COVID-19 crisis. Drones are being used for progress monitoring and site mapping as companies try to speed up delivery of projects. In November 2020, New York's Department of Finance's property division said that it is looking into the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems for tasks such as surveying tax lots, geographic information system (GIS) mapping and aerial photography.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>One of the largest projected applications of UAVs in in agriculture. Drones can be used by farmers to monitor their crops. UAVs can survey farmland faster and at a lower cost than airplanes/satellites and also provide better data and images to farmers. The current altitude restrictions for UAVs limit the area that it can survey, but if the altitude restrictions ease a little, the area could expand and provide greater benefits to farmers.</p><p>Japan has been using UAVs for crop dusting for more than 20 years now and drones account for more than 90% of crop dusters. In the US as well, the adoption of drones in agriculture is increasing due to exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under the part 107 rule.</p><p>China's largest agriculture drone maker XAG is trying to automate rice farming in China with the launch of its drone-based direct seeding system called JetSeed. It could replace manual seed planting and raise efficiency amid a labor shortage due to COVID-19.</p><p>In January 2023, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given operational authorization to China-based XAG's agricultural spraying aircraft P40 and V40. This is the first-time drone spraying and spreading has been legalized for use on UK farms.</p><p>Public Safety</p><p>This area again presents huge opportunities for UAVs. Drones can be used for law enforcement, search and rescue missions, firefighting and medical services. Civil governments are deploying an increasing number of unmanned systems.</p><p>The US and European governments have launched many new pilot programs to deploy UAV systems to protect borders. The United Nations and other peacekeepers are also deploying unmanned aerial systems to provide protection.</p><p>In the US, many agencies have acquired drones. Most of these agencies are police/sheriff departments followed by fire departments. In October 2022, the sheriff department of Las Vegas announced plans to deploy 400 drones as responders to rising gun violence. In Indiana and Maryland, police have successfully used drones to catch suspects and thieves. In Oakland, the fire department used drones to hot spots, which were not extinguished during a firefighting mission. The Los Angeles Fire Department has been using drones to make hot-spot identification and aerial mapping for wildfire response, as well as incident response for other search and rescue missions.</p><p>Further, drones can collect information, data and images on natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. UAVs have great potential for surveying storm damage and locating people after natural disasters. The US National Guard is using AI-powered drones to track wildfires in real time. The AI-backed drones can predict the area where fire is most likely to spread based on previous fires.</p><p>The US is using drones for border security as well. The drones support the border patrol team by providing enhanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and reducing the risk to human operators on the ground.</p><p>Inspections</p><p>UAVs can be used for inspections in areas such as wind turbines, oil pipelines, power lines, railroads and more. Oil and gas companies can use a drone to conduct the required monthly inspection of their pipelines. Instead of hiring a helicopter, which is costly, companies can use drones to do the same at lower cost. Drone inspections can survey hundreds of miles of pipeline and pinpoint the location of the leaks, thereby reducing traditional surveilling costs by nearly 90%.</p><p>In November 2021, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced plans to use of drones for passenger aircraft inspection. The drones can inspect the aircraft for minor damage inflicted by events like hailstorms and lightning strikes.</p><p>Similarly, UAVs can inspect wind turbines, several hundred feet in the air, removing the need for an individual to physically reach the place. Netherlands-based wind energy company Vestas is using drones to conduct inspection of its 1,250 wind turbines. Archaeologists can use UAVs to inspect the sites and also patrol for looters. The city of London is using drones for surveys which are used for repairing and maintaining assets across the underground rail network.</p><p>1.5 Regulatory Environment</p><p>Drones are taking off in a big way. Once the preserve of the military, UAVs are now widely popular in the commercial sector, thanks to consumer-grade UAVs that become increasingly sophisticated and cheaper. Though regulatory obstacles could hinder growth prospects.</p><p>Currently, there are different sets of rules governing the uses of commercial UAVs around the world. In December 2020, the US FAA approved a new set of regulations governing commercial UAVs. The FAA will allow small drones to operate at night and over people and will require remote identification of the drones. This new regulation will bring a step closer to commercial drone use for agriculture, infrastructure repair, and eventually, even deliveries from companies such as Amazon.</p><p>Canada has had safety regulations in place that govern the use of UAVs. A recreational pilot operating a drone weighing less than 35kgs does not currently require either a license or a special flying permit. It, however, must follow a list of Transport Canada safety guidelines, such as staying nine kilometers from an airport, flying under 90 meters and always keeping the craft within eyesight.</p><p>Australia requires no registration of recreational drones. Recreational drone operators must comply with Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) rules that allow drones to be flown only within a visual line of sight. There are other restrictions on the maximum altitude, vicinity near airports and flying overcrowded places.</p><p>The regulations allow commercial operators to fly drones weighing less than 2kg without a license. Operators must still adhere to all the existing rules for recreational drone use such as not to fly within 5.5km of an airport, above 400 feet or within 30m of buildings, railways or vehicles, and always to have line of sight of the drone.</p><p>Drones that weigh less than 20kgs in the UK can fly in normal airspace for private use as long as the operator is not planning to use data or images from the flight acquired by flying close to people or objects. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requires all UAVs to remain 150 meters from crowded events or large assemblies, 50m from an individual or building, and stay within line of sight, which is 500m horizontally and 122m vertically. Drones that weigh more than 20kgs are currently banned from flying in civilian airspace.</p><p>The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has established new rules on drones. Under the rules, drone operators will have to be registered with their national authority and the drones will need to have a direct remote identification system in place. The regulatory framework will ensure the protection of citizens' privacy rights while addressing security issues as well.</p><p>China is moving rapidly to establish regulatory framework for drones. In October 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced the first Unmanned Civil Aviation Experimental Zones (UCAEZs) to help accelerate the drone industry in China. The new experimental zones are designed to not only offer the airspace for testing innovative drone applications, but to ease the process of developing drone businesses.</p><p>1.6 Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Opportunities</p><p>UAV industry presents tremendous opportunities for investors, companies as well as government. UAV technology has reached a maturity point that has placed it at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. As UAV companies around the world make drones more accessible, the UAV sector, despite the undeveloped regulatory framework, is set to develop into one of the most dynamic growth industries this decade. There are some 450 UAV companies worldwide behind this growing multibillion-dollar industry, with the number growing.</p><p>Both the military and commercial markets are set to grow rapidly in the next few years, as the US economy continues to recover, technology continues to diffuse around the world, as designs become more streamlined and efficient and as more industries adopt existing business processes for UAV use.</p><p>The non-military, especially the commercial drone segment, is set to grow the fastest with projections of mid to high teens growth over the next the next decade. The latest developments in computer vision, machine learning, cloud and data analytics are expected to push drone deployment in the mainstream commercial sector. In the US and many other places around the world, the regulations either remain too restrictive or are yet to be given a final shape, which has been a deterrent in the pace of UAV adoption.</p><p>With the explosion of interest in building and operating unmanned aircraft systems, the use of UAV technology is set to generate more high-tech jobs, with millions in tax revenues and tens of billions in economic impact.</p><p>UAV technology is moving ever faster forward as the market continues to flourish. Industry will need to consider how to best integrate UAVs into their businesses.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Safety, privacy and regulatory barriers remain key challenges for the rapid adoption of UAVs. The most urgent challenge for the governments is to ensure that the drone operations remain safe.</p><p>Privacy is another key concern that needs to be addressed. UAVs collect massive amounts of data including video and images, which sometimes could result in the invasion of personal privacy. A livestream or a recording of individuals or buildings can easily be captured without consent. Also, even if the data collected is with consent, the transmission of data itself remains vulnerable to hacking. The growth and evolution of the UAV industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption unless there is more clarity on the rules.</p><p>Illegal use of UAVs for criminal activities is another big challenge. For instance, drug cartels have used drones to transfer illegal drugs in the US. These vehicles tend to fly for short periods at very low altitudes. This makes it very difficult to detect using conventional sensor systems. Also, UASs or drones could be a source of public nuisance. If a drone flying over a public place loses control and falls, it could cause substantial damage to the property as well as endanger lives.</p><p>In conclusion, the UAVs have raised a lot of concerns and it is up to policymakers to design and create laws that facilitate the good use of the technology while discouraging its harmful use.</p><p>2. Leading Companies</p><p>2.1 Aeronautics Ltd (acquired by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.)</p><p>Aeronautics Ltd is an Israeli company that provides comprehensive Defense Solutions and has become known as one of the major global providers of security consulting services and defense applications.

The Pineries includes 1,070 acres of scenic open space, a large trail head, approximately 8.5 miles of single-track trails, and a restroom for the public. The open space will be open from dawn to dark.</p><p>The land for the Pineries Open Space was accepted by El Paso County through the land development process. The site straddles the Palmer Divide in the Black Forest area and is characterized by gentle rolling terrain, grassland meadows, ponderosa pine forests, wetlands, and small ponds dotting the area. The open space also boasts abundant wildlife, including elk, white tail deer, various raptor birds, and wild turkeys. The Palmer Land Trust holds a conservation easement for the site which ensures the wildlife, aesthetic, recreational, ecological, and scenic values will be preserved and maintained in perpetuity.</p><p>While the Pineries Open Space Master Plan was completed in 2010 the area was extremely damaged by the Black Forest Fire in 2013. The fire delayed the opening of the site for public use.

The plane was flying from Kunming in the southwestern province of Yunnan to the industrial center of Guangzhou along the east coast.<br/>China Eastern flight 5735 was traveling 523 mph at around 29,000 feet when it entered a steep and fast dive around 2:20 p.m. local time, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com. The plane plunged to 7,400 feet before briefly regaining about 1,200 feel in altitude, then dove again. The plane stopped transmitting data 96 seconds after starting to fall.<br/>Local villagers were first to arrive at the forested area where the plane went down and sparked a blaze big enough to be seen on NASA satellite images. Hundreds of rescue workers were swiftly dispatched from Guangxi and neighboring Guangdong province.<br/>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the CAAC said, correcting earlier reports that 133 people had been on board. It was about an hour into the flight, and nearing the point at which it would begin descending into Guangzhou, when it pitched downward.<br/>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an \"all-out effort\" by the rescue operation, as well as for an investigation into the crash and to ensure complete civil aviation safety.<br/>Relatives of crew members arrived at a China Eastern office near the Kunming airport where the plane took off, state broadcaster CCTV reported. On Monday night, an Associated Press journalist saw police officers and security guards patroling outside the office with flashlights, ordering journalists to leave.<br/>At a hotel near the airport, about a dozen people, some in jackets identifying them as members of China's aviation agency, huddled around tables and read documents.<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLMBN-8024575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLMBN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6527-XW31-DY7P-P36K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145264</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Columbian Publishing Co.

It's still busy, but not as busy as it had been. Glacier National Park closed the backcountry campsites and the evacuation warning that came with the Hay Creek Fire was just that \u2014 a warning.</p><p>But big fires have a way of turning back crowds.</p><p>\"People-wise it's slower,\" said Mackenzie Spaulding, who works the counter at the store. \"A lot of people think we're closed.\"</p><p>The wildfire illustrates just how dependent a local business can be on tourism and the weather. Climate change has resulted in bone dry summers and the threat of wildfires is now a yearly occurrence in Northwest Montana.</p><p>To wit: The years 2015, 2017, 2018 and now this year all saw major wildfires either in or near Glacier National Park. Last summer there were no large fires close to the region, but there were days on end with smoke from wildfires to the west. The summer of 2019 was the last one with appreciable and timely rains in the summer months,</p><p>\"The trend is clear,\" Hammerquist said. \"That's all you have to say.\"</p><p>Being off the grid, he's spending more of solar power, he said. This year he plans on installing 54 more solar panels.</p><p>This fire is a new experience for some employees.</p><p>Spaulding hails from Kansas City and had never seen a forest fire up until a few weeks ago.</p><p>The Merc at one point had 35 employees this summer, Hammerquist said. Some have gone home a few weeks early for college due to the fire.</p><p>Baker Miriam Martinez is from San Diego, California. She said baking at the Merc has been a great experience, because they do everything form scratch \u2014 many commercial bakeries, she noted, use pre-mixed ingredients. The Merc even hand-rolls its dough. She gets up at 4:30 a.m. every morning and is in bed by 10 p.m. on her work days. A nap some time during the day helps.</p><p>When the  summer season ends she'll go back to Grossmont College in California to its culinary program. The fire has had one silver lining \u2014 the Merc will return to selling its baked goods at the Whitefish Community Market on Tuesdays. It had become so busy they weren't able sell at the market earlier this year.</p><p>In addition, the county has treated the lower end of the North Fork Road for dust, so it's not nearly as rough as it was earlier this year.</p><p>Martinez and Spaulding said they appreciate the efforts of the firefighters and it's good to visit with them when they stop by the store.</p><p>\"It's nice to see them come in and grab and pastry,\" Spaulding said.</p><p>___ (c)2021 the Hungry Horse News (Columbia Falls, Mont.)

The 1,200-mile pipeline was proposed in 2008 and would carry up to 35 million gallons of crude daily for transfer to refineries and export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico. It's been tied up for years in legal battles and several court challenges are still pending, including one that's due before a judge next week. Fire near Chernobyl still burns: KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Emergency teams in Ukraine on Monday continued battling a forest fire in the contaminated area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that has raised radiation fears. Police said they tracked down a person suspected of starting the blaze by setting dry grass on fire in the area. The 27-year-old man said he burned grass \"for fun\" and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly, officials said. Two blazes erupted Saturday, and firefighters said they managed Monday to put out one, but the second one continued burning, covering about 50 acres.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001166386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMF-FFB1-JBRC-V01V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Energy &amp;

Cars, pines are charred. <br/>More than 300 people were evacuated from Varybombi and two other neighbouring villages on Tuesday evening and police said they came to the rescue of 70 people surrounded by flames. <br/>There were no victims, and on Wednesday afternoon, deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias said the blaze was coming under control. <br/> The centre of Athens is covered in smoke as fires rage nearby Photo: AFP / LOUISA GOULIAMAKI  <br/>According to Hardalias, Greece has been hit with around 118 fires in the last 24 hours as a severe heatwave hits the country, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/>\"My house was spared the worst, God spared us, but neighbouring houses were burnt,\" Giorgos Mitropoulos told AFP. <br/>The student described the blaze as an \"environmental disaster\" at the foot of Mount Parnitha, part of the European Union's Natura 2000 network of nature conservation sites. <br/>The mountain range had already been ravaged by flames in 2007. <br/>\"Luckily, lots of volunteers saved the animals, the horses, the dogs and cats,\" said Mitropoulos. <br/>Some 200 horses in riding centres in the area were moved to safety, the Greek horse-riding confederation said. <br/>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the fire was rendered \"difficult\" due to \"extreme heat conditions.\" <br/>But Christos Sfetsas blamed forestry authorities and a \"lack of preventive measures, like the establishment of roads protecting forests against fires\" that would allow specialist vehicles to better access the forests. <br/>Authorities in Athens have recommended residents stay indoors and wear a mask to protect against the ash and lingering smoke. <br/>The European Union's crisis management commissioner said it would help, and Cyprus and Sweden were both sending two water-bombing planes to help battle the fires. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767162810993679625979100070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639B-RSB1-F03R-N2XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001473</classCode><className>RESCUE OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following press release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor KathyHochultoday announced the deployment of the New York Army and Air National Guards, along with a number of other resources, to furthersupport fire suppression effortsat the 130- to 150-acre wildfire currently burning inMinnewaskaState Park Preserve. Beginning today, two Army National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters with three-person crews, capable of dropping 600 gallons of water at a time,have begun aerial operations, while a contingent of five firefighters from the Air National Guardhave beendeployed.State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers, in cooperation with Ulster County, are serving as Incident Commanders, and more than 200 wildland firefighters and volunteers, including Rangers, local fire response resources, and staff from DEC, Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, New York State Police Aviation, and State Fire are fighting the fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additionally, 20 Canadian firefighters from Quebec, secured through the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact, are set to arrive on Thursday. TheCompact, established in the 1940s, provides the means for its member states and provinces to cope with fires that might be beyond the capabilities of a single member through information, technology and resource sharing (mutual aid) activities.</p><p>\"As wildfires continue to rage throughMinnewaskaState Park, I urge every New Yorker to take sensible precautions to keep themselves and theirfamiliessafe,\"GovernorHochulsaid.\"I thank all of our brave first responders, partner agencies and neighbors who are working around the clock to protect our communities.\"</p><p>TheShawangunkfire complex consists of three fires in the region and the responseis being ledfrom theNapanochincident command. TheNapanochPoint fire inMinnewaskaState Park Preserve started over the weekendas a resultof a suspected lightning strike and is 130 to 150 acres. A smaller fire approximately two miles east of theNapanochPoint fire, named Stony Kill,was detectedyesterday and is approximately 0.68 acres. The Wurtsboro fire in the town ofMamakatingalso started over the weekend and is approx. 70 acres.</p><p>Minnewaskaremains closed until further notice. No residencesare impactedat this time. Out of an abundance of caution to protectresidencescloses to theNapanochPoint fire, DEC Forest Rangers and staff volunteers will soon be working in the town ofWarwarsingnearBermeRoad to put a contingency fire line in place. A community meetingwill be heldat the Ellenville Junior/Senior High School Auditorium at 28 Maple Avenue in Ellenville today, Aug. 30, at 7 p.m. This will be an opportunity for residents and others in the impacted area to ask questions about the coordinated fire response.</p><p>Since the fires began, a coordinated effort of state and local resources has been on the ground attempting to suppress the fires.Firefighters are working in a joint unified command led by State Forest Rangers. Forest Rangers have significant experience in incident command and fire prevention strategies due to their extensive training andcooperative wildland firefighting missionsto other states. Additional multi-agency resources include New York State Police Aviation, which has flown two helicopters since Sunday and dropped approximately 120-180 300-gallon buckets of water per day.Each of the two National Guard Black Hawk helicopters have dumped 12 buckets of water every hour, a total of24,600 gallonbuckets, since being deployed.The New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services has also dispatched theState's Incident Management Team and several emergency communications experts to provide further support. The State Office of Fire Prevention and Control activated theState's Fire Mobilization and Mutual Aid Plan and Fire Operations Center to ensure the timely coordination of additional resources.</p><p>New York StateDepartment of Environmental Conservation Commissioner BasilSeggossaid, \"On the ground and in the air, DEC's Forest Rangers and expert wildland firefighters are putting into practice hours spent battling wildland fires here in New York and in western states. These firefightersare focusedon protecting the public and working to contain the fire. Until we get significant rainfall, these fires are going to keep burning. We need everyone to dotheirpart and be careful with fire. While this fire started with a lightning strike, most of the fireswe'veseen this summer started with an unattended campfire. If youdon'tneed to build a fire, don't. The extremely dry vegetation can ignite almost immediately.\"</p><p>New York State Parks Commissioner ErikKulleseidsaid,\"I am grateful for the many agencies and personnel who have stepped up to protect a treasured natural and recreational resource. Firefighters are working in grueling conditions to contain this fire - dealing with difficult terrain and tough weather conditions. I commend them all for quickly jumping into action to help.\"</p><p>New York StateHomeland Security and Emergency Services Commissioner Jackie Bray said,\"New York's first responders are fully coordinated with our local partners and despite the difficult terrain and weather conditions, these dedicated professionals will not rest until these fires are suppressed. As this situation continues to evolve, we will continue to make every possible resource available to ensure this beautiful state park and surrounding communities are protected.\"</p><p>The State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services is also dispatching theState's Incident Management Team (IMT), as well as emergency communications experts from the Division's Office of Interoperable and Emergency Communications. The IMT is a multi-agency/multi-jurisdictional team thatcan be deployed or activated when needed to manage an incident or event safely, effectively, and efficiently, regardless of the cause, size, or complexity.</p><p>New York State Police Superintendent Kevin P.Bruensaid,\"Our Aviation Unit continues to coordinate with other state and local agencies on the ground to provide air support to help contain the fires. Our pilots have specialized training to fight wildfires and will continue to fly water drop missions as needed until the fires are under control.\"</p><p>Major General Raymond Shields, the Adjutant General for New York, said,\"Members of our New York National Guard conduct training and readied ourselves for potential firefighting support to our first responders. Working alongside our state and local agency partners brings flexibility to the firefighting response. Our military training and capabilities lend themselves for missions such as this and we look towards a quick and safe containment of these fires.\"</p><p>WawarsingTown Supervisor Terry Houck said,\"Thank you to GovernorHochul, the State agencies, and all the first responders working around the clock to combat the flames on theShawangunkRidge. Our community is grateful for the work being done to keep our citizens safe.\"</p><p>Ulster County Executive Patrick K. Ryan said,\"I want to thank Governor KathyHochuland all of the first responders who have worked tirelessly during this wildfire,\" County Executive Pat Ryan said. \"We will continue to work to limit the spread of the fire and I ask all residents to be mindful of the dry season that we are in and take necessary precautions to reduce the chances of further fires.\"</p><p>New York State is closely monitoring the weather conditions as a front moves into the State from the west. While some rain may be expected, the amount of rainis not anticipatedto have a significant impact and could lead to unfavorable conditions including high winds and lightning strikes.</p><p>New York's Hudson Valley and Catskill regions remain at high fire danger risk (view the current Fire Danger Map),meaning outdoor fires have the potential to spread quickly, especially if the wind picks up. Fires may become serious and difficult to control unless successfully contained while small.</p><p>All campfires and open burning arecurrently bannedin Mid-Hudson Region State Parks. Checkparks.ny.govfor more information.</p><p>DEC continues to encourage New Yorkers and visitors to follow the recommendations below to reduce the risk of wildfires.</p><p>While camping in the backcountry, New Yorkersare advisedto:</p><p>* Use existing campfire rings where possible.</p><p>* Build campfires away from overhanging branches, steep slopes, rotten stumps, logs, dry grass, and leaves. Pile extra wood away from the fire.</p><p>* Clear the area around the ring of leaves, twigs, and other flammable materials.</p><p>* Never leave a campfire unattended. Even a small breeze could cause the fire to spread quickly.</p><p>For information on open burning and campfire safety in New York, go to DEC'sOpen Burning in New YorkandFire Safety When Campingwebpages.

Also alarming was that the cost for a typical basket of non-food and non-energy goods also rose 6 percent, reaching another 40-year high. The spikes in inflation indicate that '#8216;Bidenflation' is no longer a transitory brush fire, but a fast-spreading forest fire of rising prices,' co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity Stephen Moore[2] reportedly told The Washington Times.[3] <br/>Unsurprisingly, ABC's Good Morning America (GMA), CBS's This Morning, and NBC's Today and 3rd Hour of Today shows gave the BLS report almost no coverage on their Feb. 10 broadcasts. Instead of inflation coverage, viewers were shown Pride Candles, a rubik's cube sculpture, an alien diamond and the fictional character and mascot of the Beijing Olympics, Bing Dwen Dwen. <br/>NBC's Today show made no mention of the inflation news at all, even in the chyron. The network spent roughly a minute covering \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Rubik's Cubes. <br/>NBC's 3rd Hour of Today also omitted any reference to the record inflation. It gushed for over four minutes about the Chinese Communist Party's Olympic Mascot: Bing Dwen Dwen[4]. '#8216;We've got a closer look at the breakout star of the Winter Olympics, the mascot, BING DWEN DWEN,' Today co-host Al Roker[5] gleefully exclaimed. <br/>Apparently, NBC considers a mascot favored by the Communist Chinese Party more worthy of coverage than skyrocketing inflation that will affect the livelihoods of everyday Americans. <br/>CBS followed in NBC's footsteps and ignored the hike in inflation completely. It fixated on a black diamond with possible alien origins rather than reporting on the inflation news that affects the wallets of millions of Americans. <br/>ABC's Good Morning America gave just one mention on inflation in a chyron, below. <br/>'Wall Street reacting to new inflation data today,' read the ABC chyron. But ABC scrubbed any comment of a 40-year high in inflation or even the phrase 'high inflation.' The outlet instead chose to spend precious minutes of coverage on breaking news: 'Pride Candles.' <br/>This is not the first time that the Big Three have downplayed historic hikes in inflation. The Big Three morning network shows also censored[6] a BLS report which showed the biggest inflation surge in more than 30 years. ABC, CBS and NBC reported on Ryan Reynolds, the climate crisis and holiday shopping instead. <br/>Conservatives are under attack. Contact ABC News at (818) 460-7477, CBS News at (212) 975-3247 and NBC News at (212) 664-6192 and hold them to account for giving virtually no coverage of the BLS inflation report to viewers on their morning shows. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freedomworks.org/content/stephen-moore\">https://www.freedomworks.org/content/stephen-moore</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/feb/10/us-inflation-jumped-75-in-the-past-year-a-40-year-/?utm_source=Boomtrain&amp;utm_medium=subscriber&amp;utm_campaign=newsalert&amp;utm_content=newsalert&amp;utm_term=newsalert&amp;bt_ee=u%2Bm07hKf%2Bx%2FioMrr9FYPPIr8OVNHj%2FrD7kQqQXRyaoM%3D&amp;bt_ts=1644502759444\">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/feb/10/us-inflation-jumped-75-in-the-past-year-a-40-year-/?utm_source=Boomtrain&amp;utm_medium=subscriber&amp;utm_campaign=newsalert&amp;utm_content=newsalert&amp;utm_term=newsalert&amp;bt_ee=u%2Bm07hKf%2Bx%2FioMrr9FYPPIr8OVNHj%2FrD7kQqQXRyaoM%3D&amp;bt_ts=1644502759444</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://olympics.com/en/beijing-2022/mascot\">https://olympics.com/en/beijing-2022/mascot</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/alroker?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">https://twitter.com/alroker?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2021/11/10/morning-nets-censor-bls-report-showing-biggest-inflation\">https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2021/11/10/morning-nets-censor-bls-report-showing-biggest-inflation</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) made the following statement after the United States District Court for the District of Arizona modified an injunction stemming from an ongoing lawsuit regarding Mexican Spotted Owl habitat. This modification will allow eight forest management projects in the Tonto National Forest to resume work.</p><p>\"Today's announcement by the Forest Service that the courts will allow some forest management projects to move forward is welcome news to all Arizonans. Already this season we have seen what damage dangerous fires can do to our forests, while managing these fires has been made even more difficult by the ongoing challenge of COVID-19. Fires burn habitat for all species, regardless of their protected status. The fact that we must beg and plead the courts for the chance to clean our forests, to protect against the habitat and life threatening disaster that is a forest fire, is a direct result of lawsuits from radical environmental groups. We must speed up efforts to clean our forests to make our forests healthier and safer.

I really do. Rep. Liz Cheney has conducted herself honorably for the past nine months. Her courage in telling the truth about the election and the insurrection of Jan. 6 has been punished by the Republican conference. Former President Trump is apparently working feverishly to unseat Cheney from Congress altogether, and his lickspittle lieutenants are joining the effort. </p><p>The invertebrate minority leader, Kevin McCarthy -- who, let's recall, declared Jan. 13 that \"the president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters\" -- has long since scurried back under Trump's skirts. McCarthy sniped that Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican appointed to the Jan. 6 committee over the objections of party leadership, are \"Pelosi Republicans.\" </p><p>The opening segments of the Jan. 6 committee were another fine moment for Cheney. She began by thanking the police officers who testified about their experiences defending the Capitol that day. </p><p>She went on to outline the stakes: \"If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our Constitutional Republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.\" </p><p>I respect Cheney's willingness to pay a price. She understood that by taking on the \"big lie\" and the almost-as-consequential lie about what happened Jan. 6, she was risking her leadership position, her seat and possibly her own security. Every word of truth that she (and Kinzinger) utters is like a balm of Gilead. </p><p>And yet, the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, \"Is it too late?\" </p><p>Cheney and Kinzinger had many opportunities to extinguish this forest fire before it became a raging inferno. Both supported Trump's reelection in 2020.  </p><p>Both voted against the first Trump impeachment. They stuck with their support for his reelection, despite the first debate with Biden, despite the catastrophic handling of covid-19, despite QAnon. and despite the avalanche of lies and cruelty that corrupted America's soul -- and prepared the ground for the violent insurrection they now are investigating. </p><p>Is it welcome that they finally found a line they couldn't cross? A thousand times, yes. But how might this story have unfolded differently if they, and thousands of other Republicans, had found their uncrossable lines sooner? </p><p>Trump was the arsonist. But if every time he dropped a match on the dry tinder of American polarization, Republican elected officials and others had leaped to extinguish the small flames, we would not be here. </p><p>We have seen the end of 160 years of the peaceful transfer of power. We've seen the majestic United States Capitol turned into a scene from a dystopian fantasy. The armed mob smashed and tortured and caused deaths. They erected a gallows and hunted for the speaker of the House and for the vice president. And Republicans are excusing, downplaying or whitewashing what happened. An entire political party has abandoned commitment to the rule of law. </p><p>Trump attacked the basics of American democracy. The consequences were foreseeable. There were countless warnings. The great tragedy of this moment is not that Trump attempted what he did, but that so few Republicans tried to stop him when it would have made a difference. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-4099368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638X-T9C1-DYCW-C4VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 30, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGU</classCode><className>2021 US CAPITOL RIOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The first was \"human tectonics,\" a theory of human-environment interaction that Balog has been working to popularize throughout his career.</p><p>\"Human tectonics is the force that our eight billion people, our technologies, and our desire for affluence and survival exert on the planet,\" Balog says. \"Humanity has a profound impact on our environment, and that level of force deserves a name.\"</p><p>The second key term that Balog delved into was the Anthropocene, the current epoch of geologic time in which human activity is having a significant impact on the planet's climate and ecosystems.</p><p>\"The notion of the Anthropocene is simply that the force of humanity is so intense that it is forming the character of geologic time right now. Humanity is literally shaping Earth as we know it,\" Balog explained.</p><p>Through a joint exploration of human tectonics and the Anthropocene, Balog has concluded that the environment can no longer be understood in terms of just the four main elements (earth, wind, water, and fire), but rather that a fifth element is now necessary to truly understand it: human beings.</p><p>Balog illustrated the impact of humans on the environment through a series of more than 50 of his own photographs as well as clips from his award-nominated 2018 film, The Human Element.</p><p>One clip documents the efforts of California firefighters to put out the 2016 Soberanes forest fire. On screen, planes fly low over the blazing landscape, attempting to smother the rapidly spreading fires. On the ground, Balog, dressed in firefighting gear, captures the efforts of individual firefighters as they wade through ash and smoke to suppress smaller blazes.</p><p>As a resident of Boulder, Colo., where wildfires are so prevalent that they have been given their own season, Balog is all too familiar with the dangers of flame.</p><p>\"Here in central New York, where it's so green and it rains a lot, you don't worry about wildfires very much, but out West where it is so brown and dry, we often worry about wildfires all year long.\"</p><p>In recent decades, the fire season in the western United States has grown longer and more intense as a result of the warming climate, and Balog made underscored the cause-and-effect relationship.</p><p>\"There is a very distinct relationship between the warming of the atmosphere and the frequency of wildfires. This has been well documented, it's not an abstraction, and it's not a computer model. It's empirical evidence on the ground,\" Balog said.</p><p>One of the most striking images that Balog shared was of a school bus that had been partially incinerated in a fire outside of Boulder in 2010. The blaze had been so intense that the red and yellow lights on the bus melted and dripped down its exterior.</p><p>\"I have found the fires to be incredibly terrifying, violent, and upsetting, but at the same time, they're insanely beautiful. The four years that we spent shooting the wildfires and those fighting them was some of the most interesting work of my life,\" Balog said.</p><p>From Fire to Ice</p><p>Balog then shifted his focus from fire to ice in order to share his experiences capturing the polar ice caps on film before they disappear.</p><p>\"These big masses of ice that appear to be dead, slow-moving, dumb, and static are actually almost alive,\" Balog said. \"They are incredibly responsive to environmental conditions and respond sometimes on an hourly and daily basis to the heat sources around them.\"</p><p>To show just how drastically the glacial landscape is changing, Balog shared a video clip from his 2019 film, Chasing Ice, featuring dozens of glacial structures and a seemingly endless expanse of ice. After acquainting the audience with a few of his favorite structures -- such as \"Birthday Canyon\" -- he revealed that nearly all have melted.</p><p>\"Glacial melt matters because all that water that was once frozen on land in the form of ice is winding up in the ocean and causing sea levels to rise. More water in the ocean means greater coastal erosion and flooding, more intense storms, and a whole host of other problems that will change the world as we know it,\" said Balog. \"If ice melt continues at the rate that it is now, the ocean of our children will be drastically different from the ocean that we take for granted today.\"</p><p>Back on Land</p><p>Finally, Balog shared with the audience his time working with and photographing animals like the late Coco the Gorilla, who became world-famous after learning how to communicate with her handlers through sign language.</p><p>As Balog photographed Coco, and particularly after he dared to look her in the eyes, he began to recognize that humans and animals are not so different from one another.</p><p>\"From my experiences with the animal kingdom, I have learned that there is a lot of intelligence and possibility in nature that is simply untapped. That may not be a scientific observation, but deep down I feel that it is true.\"</p><p>Balog left his audience with a message of hope and a challenge to do better for our world.</p><p>\"Everything that we have created as homo sapiens with this three-pound brain in our head is simply an invention. It's all made up, the good, the bad, and the indifferent,\" said Balog. \"Our opportunity as human beings is always to make up good things instead of crazy things. We have that capability, and now more than ever before, we need to make use of it.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7834344 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7834344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65FH-VHP1-JC11-1028-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 14, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>COLGATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp; GEOPHYSICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097R4</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAA</classCode><className>VISUAL ARTISTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001613</classCode><className>SPONSORSHIP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Turns out we didn't. We only spent two days on the train, and only about three hours of that was in the Rockies. I didn't intentionally mislead you. I just didn't understand the nature of the trip for which we had signed up.We arrived in Vancouver on Monday May 23, checked into our hotel, had a nice dinner, walked a bit through the downtown area, and went to bed early.By 8 a.m. the next morning, the Rocky Mountaineer was pulling out of the trainyard with about 300 passengers. </p><p>Each Silverleaf car (which was the level we chose), held up to 54 passengers. Our car had 52. We had mostly free run of our own car, and could go out onto what they called an open-air vestibule a small platform where the cars joined together which had chest high walls to protect you from falling out. This gave you fresh air and an unobstructed view of whatever we were passing, and there was a rush to get there when an upcoming photo-op was announced. We weren't allowed to travel between cars. Our car had windows that extended about eight feet high on both sides with two spacious seats on either side of the center aisle.Breakfast, lunch, two separate snacks, and all beverages (including alcohol) were included. We ate at our seats. You could refuse, of course, but I suspect everyone put on a few pounds during the trip. I did, to my great disappointment. I've intentionally lost more than 50 pounds over the past 14 months, but gained six of that back on our trip.The Goldleaf cars, which I read about and saw through the windows, but wasn't allowed to enter, cost about $1,000 more per person than we paid, and were double-decker affairs. The bottom level of these cars were sit-down dining tables, and the upper levels had fancier seats and an unbreakable glass ceiling, giving you a much clearer view than we got from just the windows on the side of our car.The first day on the train took us through fertile farmland along the Fraser River. The terrain was similar to what you'd see in Washington or Oregon. Every ten minutes or so, one of the hosts would get on the microphone to alert us to something interesting coming up. Perhaps the biggest osprey nest along the route, perhaps the site of a particularly bad forest fire, perhaps it was an especially interesting bridge. Periodically we'd get a history lesson of this area.Since we were running late (freight trains had priority over passenger trains and we got pulled over a few times to wait), they served us a small dinner snack as well. We spent 11 hours on the train on Tuesday. At the end of the day, we waddled off the train at Kamloops, a mid-sized city I'd never heard of. Our hotel reservations had been made as part of our tour. We could have signed up for the two-star hotels, three-star hotels, or the four-star hotels (I'm pretty sure Kamloops didn't have any four-star hotels), and our luggage was in our rooms when we got there. The luggage had not traveled on the train, but rather was trucked. The trucks were faster than the train, and before we got off the train, they handed each of us our room keys and told us what bus to get on to get to our hotels. Very well organized.Wednesday morning, our luggage was picked up from our rooms, and we were bused to the same railroad cars, same seats, that we had occupied the previous day. Although they used a different menu for the daily fair, far too much food and beverage was again served. We got to the mountains fairly early, but these were not the Rockies. This was the Coastal Range. About 1 p.m. in the afternoon, they announced we were officially in the Rockies. The trees were very different. We began seeing snowbound peaks.The tracks traveled quite close to Mt. Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. We had a good view of it. This was the only time where we felt having the better view from the glass-top train cars would have been worth it. But this moment was over in ten minutes or less.When we pulled into Jasper national park after about eight hours on Wednesday, we saw the end of the Rocky Mountaineer. We had five more days in the Rockies, but the rest of our travel would be by motor coach. Exactly what our excursion was after we arrived at Jasper depended on which travel agency we had used to connect with the Rocky Mountaineer. We were with Fresh Tracks Canada and had no major complaints with the itinerary or the service.Other travel agencies scheduled different excursions in Vancouver and different methods of getting the passengers from Jasper to Calgary. It would have been nice to see a side-by-side comparison of what the different organizations offered, and at what price, but we didn't find anyplace where that information was available.Next week I'm going to talk about the last several days of our trip two days in Jasper, one in Lake Louise, two days in Banff, and our trip to Calgary. It's not my usual subject matter and for sure I'll get complaints because it's not about video poker, but that's what it's going to be. I'll be back to a regular column in two weeks.About: The largest and most-respected publisher of expert gambling strategies and Las Vegas-related titles in the world.

Crews from at least 10 departments, the Seacoast Chief Fire Officers Association and a forest fire truck from the Department of Conservation and Recreation responded.</p><p>Firefighters were expected to be at the house throughout the afternoon and into the evening putting out hotspots and checking for hidden damage.</p><p>Dwyer said the homeowner's son had just finished mowing the lawn and placed the mower under the deck. As he began seeding the yard, the boy spotted flames shooting out of the lawnmower and called 911 immediately. By the time firefighters arrived flames had made their way up the deck and into the home.</p><p>Everyone in the house escaped without injury.</p><p>Because the house is not on the town's water system, firefighters had to contend with a limited water supply, made possible by water tanker trucks. Wind was not a factor, according to Dwyer.</p><p>Assisting local firefighters were firefighters from Amesbury, Newburyport, Newbury, Merrimac, Salisbury, Groveland, Georgetown, Haverhill, Boxford, Plaistow, N.H. and other communities. An Atlantic Ambulance crew was on scene as well as the Department of Fire Services rehabilitation unit, and an air trailer from the Seacoast Chief Fire Officers unit in New Hampshire. Local police closed Bachelor Street to traffic.</p><p>\"Hell of a response from everyone, as usual,\" Dwyer said.</p><p>Dwyer said he and fellow West Newbury native Amesbury Fire Chief Ken Berkenbush were at a COVID-19 vaccine clinic at Amesbury High School when the call came in.</p><p>\"I want to thank him for his assistance, being a West Newbury guy,\" Dwyer said.</p><p>According to the town's online assessor's database, the contemporary house was built in 1987 and was last assessed at $450,200.</p><p>Dave Rogers is a staff writer with The Daily News.

The UK smashed its all-time heat mark on Tuesday, as did several cities in the Texas and Oklahoma, including Wichita Falls, which reached a broiling 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46.1 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Europe's heat wave moves eastwards, wildfires have forced tens of thousands of people from their homes, blanketing parts of Italy, Greece and France in smoke. Germany recorded its hottest day of the year as temperatures reached 104.5 F (40.3C) at a measuring station in Bad Mergentheim-Neunkirchen, in the center of the country, while Hungary and Italy have been hit with high temperatures of around 100 F (nearly 38C) in places.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The European Forest Fire Information System put 19 European countries on \"extreme danger\" alerts for wildfires on Wednesday, across an expanse stretching from Portugal and Spain in the southwest to Albania and Turkey in the southeast.</p><p>There was some respite in the UK, where temperatures dipped from an all-time high of 40.3 C (104.5 F) on Tuesday back into the 20s. But some residential areas around London were left in ruins after fires broke out across parts of the capital, stretching the fire service to its limits.</p><p>\"Yesterday was the busiest day for the fire service in London since the Second World War,\" London's mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News on Wednesday, as residents of the capital watched their homes destroyed in heat-triggered blazes they never thought possible.</p><p>A resident of Wennington, a London suburb affected by Tuesday's fires, told CNN that the gardens on his street were \"like a tinder box\" in the days leading up to the fire. Stock lost his home, eight chickens and two beehives when the fire broke out.</p><p>\"I didn't sleep last night. I was in the hotel room thinking how bad it could have gone. I just thank god that everyone got out alive,\" he said. \"We've lost everything. But when we get back, we can clear the site, put some fences up, get a couple of mobile homes and we'll start again.\"</p><p>London had no available fire engines at one point in the afternoon amid unprecedented demand, a senior fireman with the London Fire Brigade's special rescue team told CNN.</p><p>In the United States, local leaders are urging caution and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/weather/us-extreme-heat-wednesday/index.html\">issuing health warnings</url> as a heat wave that shows no sign of slowing before the weekend continues to bake the south-central regions of the country.</p><p>And in China, millions of densely-populated cities are responding to extreme heat. According to the China Meteorological Administration, at least 31 Chinese cities issued the second-highest orange alert warning, with temperatures expected to go up to 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next 24 hours.</p><p>Europe burns in record heat</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greece: </emphasis>On the outskirts of the Greek capital, Athens, firefighters have been tackling vast blazes that are being whipped up by wind. At least 600 people have been evacuated, including from a children's hospital, authorities said. One person has died and 30 have been transferred to hospitals in the capital's Attica region, the Greek Fire Service said on Wednesday.</p><p>\"Our top priority remains the safeguarding of human lives. But also that of vital public infrastructure as well as citizens' properties,\" spokesperson Ioannis Artopoios said during an earlier televised briefing.</p><p>Huge clouds of smoke remain visible in the city on Wednesday, despite the efforts of hundreds of firefighters. Romanian fire crews have been drafted in to assist the operation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Italy:</emphasis> Blazes are also being tackled in parts of Italy. Wildfires in Tuscany caused gas tanks to explode and forced evacuations overnight, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/EugenioGiani/status/1549637779977551872\">according</url> to the regional President Eugenio Giani.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Germany:</emphasis> In Alsdorf, western Germany, three residents and two firefighters were injured in a blaze on Tuesday, and much of the country is primed for more fires as temperatures rise on Wednesday.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">France:</emphasis> In France, aircraft continued to dump water over burning landscapes. Fires have been raging there for a week now, though they advanced \"very little\" on Tuesday night in the Gironde region, according to local authorities. Smoke swirled over the Brennilis nuclear power plant in Brittany on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Just as UK Prime Minister was criticized for a lack of preparedness for the heat wave, France's Emmanuel Macron too is coming under pressure to respond more quickly to the heat and fires, which have already burned 25 times more land in France than in the same period last year, government spokesperson Olivier Veran told journalists on Wednesday.</p><p>On Tuesday, the president of the fire-stricken Gironde region called for additional resources, including firefighting aircraft to be diverted there.</p><p>A campsite owner told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday that \"we have demands\" for Macron, who will be making a visit to the ravaged southwest on Wednesday.</p><p>\"We hope that he will be able to very quickly order the public services to help us, to support us in the administrative steps to put the camp site in working order as soon as possible,\" said Stephane Carella, co-owner of Pyla Camping whose site was destroyed by fires.</p><p>\"Everything has gone up in smoke,\" he said, with some 90% of his property affected by the fire. Carella described the remainders of the site as \"apocalyptic.\"</p><p>High temperatures rip through US</p><p>The baking weather in the US has so far been centered on parts of the south, and is raising particular concern about the welfare of elderly, vulnerable and homeless people.</p><p>In Texas, 14 prisons have no air conditioning and 55 have only partially-working systems, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) told CNN in an email. Texas has had at least four heat waves this season, a hot streak that started impacting the state before the official start of summer. Since May 1, more than half their days have come with some level of heat alert.</p><p>As temperatures in neighboring Arizona reached triple digits on Tuesday afternoon, around 7,000 people lost power due to strong storms, a spokesperson for the Arizona Public Service Company said.</p><p>In some areas, such as Miami-Dade County and Phoenix, local governments have hired chief heat officers to help residents combat the heat.</p><p>Much of the country's north, and parts of Canada, are preparing for temperatures to soar too. Philadelphia declared a \"heat caution\" starting noon Tuesday and extending to until 8 p.m. ET Thursday, the city said in an email to CNN. It also declared a \"code red\" alert for homeless people in the area.</p><p>The Canadian government issued heat and severe thunderstorm advisories in at least four provinces on Tuesday.         </p><p>CNN's Elinda Labropoulou, Chris Stern, Nina dos Santos, Robert Shackleford, Madalena Araujo, Alex Hardie, Bianca Nobilo, Dave Alsup, Renee Bertini and Joseph Ataman contributed reporting.         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Austin-Tonopah, Ely, Mountain City-Ruby Mountains-Jarbidge and Santa Rosa Ranger Districts, and Spring Mountains National Recreation Area remain in Stage I Fire Restrictions.</p><p>USDA Forest Service land managers increase fire restrictions based on several factors including fire activity levels, current and forcasted weather, fuel moisture, and the availability of firefighting resources. Due to the current conditions, there is a likelihood of a fire exhibiting extreme behavior and posing containment problems for firefighters. As such, fire restrictions are necessary to reduce the risk of human-caused fires, in turn enhancing public safety and preserving firefighting forces for longer and more extreme fire seasons.</p><p>Stage II Fire Restrictions prohibit the following:</p><p>1. Building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, campfire, or stove fire on National Forest System lands. Campfires are prohibited on all lands managed by the Bridgeport and Carson Ranger Districts, including developed recreation sites, campgrounds, and day use areas. This includes twig stoves commonly used by hikers, portable wood/charcoal fire pits and stoves. Portable stoves with contained fuel sources (propane, jellied petroleum, etc.) and an on/off switch are allowed. California campfire permits are required for the use of any portable stove, regardless of fire restriction level, in the state of California.</p><p>2. Smoking, outside an enclosed vehicle or building. Exception: smoking while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter that is clear of all flammable materials.</p><p>3. Welding, or operating an acetylene or other torch with open flame.</p><p>4. Using an explosive. Please remember, fireworks and exploding targets are never permitted on public lands.</p><p>5. Operating a chainsaw or other equipment powered by an internal combustion engine between 1:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Woodcutting and other activities need to be completed prior to 1 p.m. daily. It is always prohibited to operate or use any internal or external combustion engine without an approved USDA spark arrestor that is properly installed, maintained, and in effective working order.</p><p>6. Operating or parking a vehicle or other motorized equipment over or on top of dried/cured vegetation. Exceptions: Parking in an area devoid of vegetation within 10 feet of the roadway, overnight parking in Forest Service developed campgrounds and at trailheads.</p><p>Please obey all fire restrictions. Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including up to $5,000 in fines and/or six months in jail. In addition, anyone found responsible for starting a wildfire can be held civilly and criminally liable.</p><p>The public is the first line of defense in preventing wildfires. Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest fire management and firefighters thank you for recreating responsibly and using extra precaution to prevent wildfires.

Grand Canyon National Park is providing interagency support to the Truxton Canon Agency and Havasupai Tribe. Approximately 285 acres in size, current fire behavior is creeping and smoldering within pinon-juniper forest. Fire managers plan to monitor the Thumb Fire.</p><p>The Tipover Fire was also detected on July 16th and is located north of Tiyo Point on the North Rim of the park. Currently the fire is estimated to be one acre in size. Fire crews are actively working to suppress the lightning ignited Tipover Fire. It is burning in ponderosa pine forest.</p><p>Smoke from the Thumb Fire is visible from the South Rim of the park. At this time there are no closures. Grand Canyon National Park is receiving interagency support from local resources from the North Zone Interagency Fire Management Organization.</p><p>Grand Canyon National Park is seeing an increase in wildfire starts due to recent monsoon activity. Each fire start is evaluated by fire management officials for the most appropriate management strategy. Firefighter safety, resources at risk, location of the fire, available resources, regional and national preparedness levels, and weather forecast are taken into consideration when responding to a wildfire ignition.

Crews are tentatively planning to begin ignitions on Silvies 7, 500 acres Monday, May 17 and Tuesday, May 18. Silvies 7 is south of National Forest System (NFS) road 31.</p><p>* Prairie City Ranger District fire crews successfully completed 250 acres on Elk 16 C, with approximately 50 acres to complete this week. The unit is located east of NFS road 16 and NFS road 1675 and west of the North Fork of the Malheur River. Crews will tentatively begin ignitions on Elk 16 unit QA, 100 acres, the week of May 24.</p><p>Blue Mountain Ranger fire crews completed ignitions on 1600 acres on Murderers Creek 6, will continue monitoring through the week. The unit is off the South Fork of Murderers Creek and adjacent to John Young Meadows. Crews are considering ignitions on Galena 30, 41, 40c and Soda Bear 4a for later in this week or early the week of May 24.</p><p>For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead, for their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity.</p><p>Spring operations reduce surface fuels, increase height of some canopy, reduce small tree densities, and help promote fire resilient trees, thereby improving our ability to protect communities from wildfire. Additionally, these prescribed fires improve wildlife habitat, promote long-term ecosystem integrity and sustainability by reducing the risk of high-severity wildland fire.</p><p>All prescribed burn activity is weather and condition dependent.</p><p>With the potential for smoke to settle in certain areas during active operations, the public can monitor the smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, <url normalizedValue=\"http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/\">http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/</url>.</p><p>Additional information regarding prescribed burning on the Malheur National Forest is available on InciWeb at <url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/\">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7426/</url> or by viewing the Prescribed Fire Activity interactive map at USFS R6 Tri-Forest Prescribed Fire Map.

Some areas, including northern Italy, are also experiencing extended droughts. <br/>Climate scientists say life-threatening heatwaves are more intense, more frequent and longer because of climate change - and coupled with droughts have made wildfires harder to fight. <br/>Severe heatwaves have come even to places like the UK, where officials have issued the country's first-ever extreme heat warning, and the weather service forecast that the record high of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7F), set in 2019, could be shattered[2]. <br/>Temperatures nudged 38C (100F) in southern England on Monday and were forecast to hit a record-breaking 40C (104F) on Tuesday, according to the UK's Meteorological Office. <br/>The national rail network urged passengers not to travel unless necessary, with some services - including a key route between northeastern England and London - not running during parts of Tuesday. <br/>London's Luton Airport said flights were suspended on Monday after a surface defect was found on the runway, although flights resumed later in the day. The hot weather melted the runway at the Royal Air Force's Brize Norton airbase, Sky News reported. <br/>Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from London, said the UK cannot cope with heatwaves, mainly because of its 'outdated and inadequate infrastructure' and a widespread lack of air conditioning. <br/>Records broken in France<br/>Regional temperature records in France were broken in more than a dozen towns, as the weather service said Monday was 'the hottest day of this heatwave'. <br/>France's often-temperate Brittany region sweltered with a record 39.3C (102.7F) in the port of Brest, surpassing a high of 35.1C (95.2F) that had stood since September 2003, French weather service Meteo-France said. <br/>Meteorologist Francois Gourand told AFP news agency earlier on Monday that 'in some southwestern areas, it will be a heat apocalypse'. <br/>Swirling hot winds complicated firefighting in the region. <br/>'The fire is literally exploding,' said Marc Vermeulen, the regional fire service chief, who described tree trunks shattering as flames consumed them, sending burning embers into the air and further spreading the blazes. 'We're facing extreme and exceptional circumstances,' he said. <br/>Authorities evacuated more towns[3], moving another 14,900 people from areas that could find themselves in the path of the fires and choking smoke. In all, more than 31,000 people have been forced from their homes and vacation spots in the Gironde region since the wildfires began on July 12. <br/>More than 200 reinforcements headed to join the 1,500 firefighters trying to contain the blazes in the Gironde, where flames neared prized vineyards and billowed smoke across the Arcachon maritime basin famed for its oysters and beaches. <br/>Three additional planes were sent to join six others fighting the fires, scooping up seawater and making repeated runs through dense clouds of smoke, the Interior Ministry said on Sunday night. <br/>'Collective action or collective suicide' <br/>Spain, meanwhile, reported a second fatality in two days in its own blazes. The body of a 69-year-old sheep farmer was found Monday in the same hilly area where a 62-year-old firefighter died a day earlier when he was trapped by flames in the northwestern Zamora province. <br/>More than 30 forest fires around Spain have forced the evacuation of thousands of people and blackened 220sq km (85sq miles) of forest and scrub. <br/>'Climate change kills,' Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez said on Monday during a visit to the western Extremadura region, the site of three major blazes. 'It kills people, it kills our ecosystems and biodiversity.' <br/>Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for ecological transition, described her country as 'literally under fire' as she attended talks on climate change in Berlin. <br/>She warned of 'terrifying prospects still for the days to come', after more than 10 days of temperatures above 40C (104F), cooling only moderately at night. <br/>At least 748 heat-related deaths have been reported in the heatwave in Spain and neighbouring Portugal, where temperatures reached 47C (117F) earlier this month. <br/>Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi, reporting from Casas De Miravete in Extremadura, said firefighters are continuing to douse the areas with water from the ground and the air 'in an effort try and dampen the soil so the wildfires don't restart'. <br/>In Portugal, much cooler weather on Monday helped fire crews make progress. More than 600 firefighters attended four major fires in northern Portugal. <br/>The Balkans region expected the worst of the heat later this week, but has already seen sporadic wildfires. <br/>Early Monday, authorities in Slovenia said firefighters brought one fire under control. <br/>Croatia sent a water-dropping plane there to help after struggling last week with its own wildfires along the Adriatic Sea. A fire in Sibenik forced some people to evacuate their homes but was later extinguished. <br/>People collect water from a fountain in Green Park in London, the United Kingdom [Kevin Coombs/Reuters] <br/>Meanwhile, at the 12th Petersberg Climate Dialogue conference in Berlin on Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a dire warning that the global warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord was slipping further out of reach. <br/>He urgedrich nations to keep the promises they have made with regard to supplying funds to tackle the situation. <br/>'This has to be the decade of decisive climate action,' he said. 'That means trust, multilateralism and collaboration. We have a choice. Collective action or collective suicide.' <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/7/17/photos-wildfires-rage-as-parts-of-europe-battle-record-heatwave\">https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/7/17/photos-wildfires-rage-as-parts-of-europe-battle-record-heatwave</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/uk-braces-for-hottest-day-on-record-with-precautions-put-in-place\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/uk-braces-for-hottest-day-on-record-with-precautions-put-in-place</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/18/forest-fire-forces-thousands-more-people-out-of-homes-in-france</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CannonAirForce-Base.jpg\">http://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CannonAirForce-Base.jpg</url> Lawmakers in Congress have been pushing the Defense Department to test for and clean up PFAS contamination at military installations. One cleanup at Cannon Air Force Base (photo) in New Mexico is not set to start until 2028. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Vernon R. Walter III) <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS40576162823_ad803f83b9_k-1536x1152-1.jpg\">http://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PFAS40576162823_ad803f83b9_k-1536x1152-1.jpg</url> Two sample bottles and a sample collection unit in Portage Creek in the Kalamazoo River watershed. The testing is for PFAS, or 'forever chemicals.' (Photo by Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/>'Early phases' of investigation <br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[9]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[13]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[14]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[15]andMinnesota[16]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[17]andSenate[18]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url
