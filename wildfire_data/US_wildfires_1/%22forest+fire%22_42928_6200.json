Denniston started his teaching career at Cornell College in 2000 and has since mentored more than 50 undergraduate students across the majors of geology, environmental studies, and archaeology. Many of his students have worked with Denniston on several projects.</p><p>In his acceptance speech for the award, which was presented at October's annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, Denniston thanked those who guided him as an undergraduate researcher and said mentoring students is the most important part of working at Cornell.</p><p>\"I love teaching in the classroom but spending time in the lab and in the field with my students is the best part of my job,\" Denniston said. \"My students regularly impress me. I've seen them reach way outside of their comfort zones on countless occasions-repelling into one cave or crawling past snakes in another, grinding through mountains of data and reading paper after paper to make sense of it all.\"</p><p>Cornell College Professor of Geology Emily Walsh wrote one of many letters nominating Denniston for the award. In that letter, she says Denniston understands the transformative power of research.</p><p>\"Rather than merely mentoring students in research, Rhawn provides the tools and framework for the students, and then hands over the reins,\" Walsh writes. \"Each student is unfailingly treated the same way--with trust and with the belief that the student can and will succeed.\"</p><p>Walsh says Denniston juggles his intensive block classes and often several student research projects at the same time. That means he's meeting with students first thing in the morning, over the lunch hour, and right after class.</p><p>\"The results of Rhawn's faculty-student research collaborations can be breath-taking,\" Walsh wrote in her nomination letter. \"Students from every background have worked with Rhawn and have succeeded. Students who may have struggled in classes realize they are good at research and apply to graduate school with a new sense of achievement and purpose. Even those students who do not pursue major research with Rhawn come away with a valuable experience--the experience of having a professor believe wholeheartedly that they can succeed at something challenging and new. And THIS is where the magic happens.\"</p><p>Not only have Denniston's students presented their findings at the Cornell College Student Symposium, but many also present their research at national meetings, such as at the Geological Society of America or the American Geophysical Union annual meetings. In addition, 18 undergraduate students have been published with Denniston in 13 peer-reviewed journal articles over the past 14 years.</p><p>Denniston has a Ph.D. in Geosciences from the University of Iowa. His research with students involves the use of stalagmites and corals as paleoenvironmental records to investigate:</p><p>* The history of tropical Australian rainfall associated with the Australian monsoon and tropical cyclones in recent millennia</p><p>* Climate variability in Portugal associated with Atlantic Ocean temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation</p><p>* Shifts in precipitation in the Western United States across ice ages</p><p>* Climate and vegetation change in the Midwest</p><p>* El Nino-Southern Oscillation activity in ancient \"greenhouse worlds\"</p><p>* Wet and dry periods in the Indian Summer Monsoon region of Nepal over the last 4000 years</p><p>* Forest fire activity in the Australian tropics since AD 1000</p><p>* * *</p><p>URL: Geosciences Division of the Council on Undergraduate Research</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7652861 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7652861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640D-4DG1-DYG2-R329-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 2, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sometimes, the messages are a friendly debate on a hot topic, while in other situations, it's a <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketing.twitter.com/en/insights/why-the-conversation-on-twitter-matters-for-brands\"> brand-related discussion </url> or simply people sharing their thoughts. Arguably, the greatest thing about Twitter is that it lets people discuss various topics essentially in real time. That's one reason why some Twitter features, like Twitter chats, have long been popular.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.renolon.com/number-of-tweets-per-day/\"> volume of tweets </url> and the format of member feeds is that tweets can often be overlooked. That is one reason why I've always said that brands should do careful research to find out when their customers are online so that they can maximize the reach of each piece of content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, even with content that's sent out at an optimal time of day, nothing is perfect. For instance, people can interact with your content for many hours and even days later. Another concern is when tweets are sent to you or discuss your brand, which can also happen at any time of day.</p><p>Fortunately, there are several ways you can keep track of tweets without overworking your staff. If you run a large enough company, you probably have some form of social monitoring software, and if you can't, then you should. However, sometimes it's necessary to look up information manually or find a Tweet sometime later. One of the easiest ways to do this is by using Twitter Advanced search.</p><p>Table Of Contents   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is Twitter Advanced Search?</emphasis></p><p>Twitter's advanced search feature lets you look for a Tweet based on certain criteria. You can use the criteria to narrow down your options until it's easy to find what you're looking for. To use the advanced search, you will start with a regular Twitter search. Then, you can eliminate tweets using categories until you find what you need.</p><p>If you have ever used a database, then you automatically understand the basics of how Twitter Advanced search works. Sometimes the options are obvious, while in other situations, you may need to experiment until you find what you need.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How can Twitter's Advanced Search Help Marketers?</emphasis></p><p>For marketers and business owners, it's a great way of finding buried tweets and customer data. With buried tweets, you can find valuable information such as consumer sentiment, requests for help from your brand, and discussions about your latest product or service. From there, you can use this customer intelligence to better tailor your marketing campaigns, deal with poor customer sentiment, or put out a forest fire before it burns the house down.</p><p>Likewise, you can learn more about your target audience. For instance, sometimes you learn that people who are interested in your product have certain hobbies or other interests. They may still be able to help you with further marketing efforts. Likewise, you might find that your customer base is more diverse than initially assumed.</p><p>A great example might be smartphone technology. When the iPhone was a groundbreaking product, it was mostly people with a lot of disposable income who loved innovative gadgets who ran out to buy them. Now, smartphone technology is almost ubiquitous, being used by almost every age group, from elementary school to senior citizens.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/promoted-tweets/\"> What are Promoted Tweets and 7 Tips to Leverage Them for Twitter Marketing </url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where is Twitter's Advanced Search Option?</emphasis></p><p>As you can see, Twitter's Advanced search can be quite useful. In fact, as marketers, it's easy to say that we should all be using it occasionally. The level of information that we can gain is quite valuable, and you never know when important data will heavily influence your next campaign.</p><p>There are two ways that you can access the advanced search option on Twitter. The first one is by typing in the search query 'Twitter Advanced search' on Google or another search engine. Twitter's advanced search should be the first item on your results list.</p><p>You can also access Advanced search directly from the Twitter website. To do this, simply go to the search bar on your Twitter feed. Search for a keyword, and then choose the advanced search option in the upper right-hand corner of your results page by selecting it from the three dots as shown here:</p><p>Once you do so, the Twitter advanced search window will appear as follows:</p><p>Once you've opened the Advanced search options window, it's time to choose the right options. This may take some trial and error, depending on what you're trying to find. In some ways, it's like the research projects we did on younger.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Understanding the Options on Twitter's Advanced Search</emphasis></p><p>In the Advanced search window, you have a lot of different options, so it's important to know what you need. While this is never an exact science, you want to select the most viable options upfront so that you can save time and effort. You can include or exclude certain words, phrases, or hashtags. You can also look for tweets sent on a particular date or those which have a lot of engagement.</p><p>With that in mind, let's look at the different filter options.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Words</emphasis></p><p>The first option within Twitter Advanced search is to filter by words used. In this case, we're not talking about hashtags or @mentions. Instead, we are concerned with the body of the text.</p><p>Twitter lets you choose from the following:</p><p/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All of these words</emphasis>   ' a Tweet needs to include every word on the list to be displayed in the results.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This exact phrase</emphasis>   ' specify an exact phrase you're looking for, such as 'the Age of Influence.'</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Any of these words</emphasis>   ' a somewhat broader net that uses a mixture of words to try and find tweets on a particular topic. I might use the words marketing, sales, and brand awareness to find tweets in my niche.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of these words</emphasis>   ' exclude words that you're not interested in. This one's especially useful if a word or series of words can identify tweets that aren't relevant to you.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">These hashtags</emphasis>   ' list hashtags that can indicate relevant Tweets.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Written in</emphasis>   ' this one is a language differentiator. There are many words that are common to multiple languages, and if one of those is the keyword, then you should consider using a language specification to get what you need.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p/><p/><p>As you can see, there are a lot of ways to narrow down your options based on the words in the Tweet. This is unsurprising when you consider the fact that there are so many words shared between niches and even languages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Accounts</emphasis></p><p>Another way to make the most of Twitter Advanced search is by specifying a particular account. For instance, you might search for the keyword 'influencer marketing' and specify results from @NealSchaffer. This way, you can avoid getting results from other marketers in this niche. Or from another point of view, you can see what I have to say about the topic.</p><p/><p>Additionally, you can specify how an account is involved in the Tweet. It may be that you want a Tweet sent by the user, sent to the user, or that mentions the user. In my case, you might be looking for 'I saw @NealSchaffer at the conference.'</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-get-more-followers-on-twitter/\"> 12 Ways How to Get More Followers on Twitter </url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Filters</emphasis></p><p>Likewise, Twitter lets you see a particular type of Tweet. The first option is to look for replies to a prior Tweet. This can help identify which tweets are getting engagement on Twitter or which ones might be a hot topic.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/linkedin-book-free-download/\"/></p><p>Similarly, you can filter for tweets that have links. In this case, you may be trying to find where content creators are sharing their blog posts or where they might be directing people to a landing page for lead generation. Of course, this one is also useful if you want to find news articles or other content related to a particular topic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Engagement</emphasis></p><p>Engagement is another Twitter Advanced search option. Here, you'll look for Tweets that have a minimum amount of engagement. On the Advanced search page, you can choose a minimum number of replies, likes, or retweets.</p><p/><p>While many of these metrics can indicate a high level of popularity for different tweets, they do show a different type of interest. If you want to do an especially thorough analysis, you might consider running a search that specifies one type of engagement and another search checking a different one. In this case, you might find that certain tweets attract two or more of these engagement types.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/twitter-engagement/\"> 9 Ways to Increase Your Twitter Engagement Today </url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dates</emphasis></p><p>This one's pretty self-explanatory. Simply choose a date range from the menu like you would most other time-based searches. Then you'll get results that conform to these criteria. One reason you might want to do this is to isolate people's responses after your company makes specific announcements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter Advanced Search: Quick and Dirty Hacks</emphasis></p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are many ways that you can use Twitter Advanced search that will both enhance your experience and provide you with valuable information. In some cases, you'll save time by selecting just a few more boxes. Other hacks help you make the best use of the information that you have gathered, turning Advanced search into a marketing tool.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Create a Saved Search</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/how-to-advanced-search-on-twitter.html\"> Each Twitter account can save up to 25 searches </url>. You can save a search by clicking More options at the top of the results page. If you need to find the same types of Tweets on a regular basis, not having to can save a lot of time. This is good both for staff workload and the overall consistency of information. For instance, if you set the Advanced search every time, then it can be easy to the very your search slightly and thereby change the results.</p><p/><p>Saved searches are a very versatile tool. You can use saved searches to keep track of your own mentions, new people sharing your content, and keywords relevant to your brand. It can also work well for customer service enhancement tools because you might be able to see how people use the platform to make requests of your staff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Check Your Interactions with Another Twitter Account</emphasis></p><p>Use the 'from these accounts' and 'to these accounts' filters to quickly see your past interactions with others. This can work well if you regularly participate in Twitter chats or if you often interact with the same people. Social media managers can also benefit from this feature by saving a search that monitors tweets set to a brand account.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discover which Topics are Most Popular on Twitter</emphasis></p><p>Topic discovery is another great option for people who work in the marketing space because it can help you identify new opportunities. For instance, you might find that there is a debate going on that appeals very strongly to your target audience.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/ageofinfluence\"/></p><p>A great example of this in recent times is social justice, such as affirmative action or the environment. Many brands won't talk about this topic normally, because it's not part of their niche. But at the same them, there might be an opportunity to connect with the major segment of a company's target audience.</p><p/><p>Topic searches are easy to set up. Go to the Twitter search box, type any search term and specify the operator min_retweets:[number] or min_faves:[number] to filter your search results. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.labnol.org/internet/twitter-search-tricks/13693/\"> Source </url> then, you only have to select the saved search to find the latest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Blog Post Ideas</emphasis></p><p>Even with a content calendar, bloggers sometimes need to topic quickly. For instance, a planned topic may become inappropriate due to major events. One can imagine, for example, a travel blogger who might've had an episode on Moscow or Kyiv planned at the beginning of 2022. Chances are that they won't be able to write that post! You might also need to find a new topic if a guest blogger cancels or something else happens that's unexpected.</p><p/><p>Want to set up a Twitter Advanced search that can help find new post ideas? Go to the 'Words' section and use the 'All of these words and 'This exact phrase.' Then, enter your search term to find your ideas for blogs. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Content Shared by Any Account</emphasis></p><p>No matter what industry you're part of, there's a good chance you want to monitor what the industry players are saying about specific topics. Not only can this help you plan ahead, but it also is useful when you need to do reputation management or pivot your overall strategy. And while following industry experts is standard, it doesn't help sort through what each of those people has to say. Instead, these tweets are mixed in with everybody else's.</p><p/><p>If you want to know what a user has been tweeting about a particular topic, use the search term 'keyword' (from: user). It's that easy.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/what-is-a-quote-tweet/\"> What is a Quote Tweet? 8 Reasons You Should be Using Them More Often for Twitter Marketing </url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Location-Based Filtering of Tweets</emphasis></p><p>Local business people, I'm talking to you. The same thing goes for anybody that needs to do a local advertising campaign or tailor a pitch based on location and issues. You can pick any keyword you want for this one, or choose keywords that are already local. It's also a great way to see what people think about a topic in different locations.</p><p/><p>To find people who are talking about your brand (or any other topic) in a specific area, use the two operators (near: and within:).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Influencers</emphasis></p><p>Influencers can help you increase your brand's visibility. You can find influencers on Twitter using the Advanced Search option by searching for specific brand keywords or hashtags, as well as the engagement levels you want, such as the number of retweets, likes, and replies. </p><p/><p>There are a couple of ways that you can set this up based on how you want to find influencers. Located some influencers, you can monitor them. Eventually, you may find that you want to engage them for an influencer marketing opportunity. When the time comes, check out my <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/how-to-reach-out-to-influencers/\"> guide to engaging influencers. </url></p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Further Reading: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nealschaffer.com/twitter-influencers/\"> Twitter Influencers: How to Find and Connect with Them </url></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Monitor Mentions</emphasis></p><p>Mentions can tell you what people think regarding your brand. Generally, people who @mention other Twitter users intend for that user to see the Tweet. They might do this for many different reasons, from complaints and customer service requests all the way to congratulatory or favorable impressions. By monitoring mentions, you can find a customer in distress, discover that a particular product or service is performing especially well, or put out a dumpster fire before it ignites the whole forest.</p><p/><p>Go to 'All of these words' in advanced search and put in all the keywords you want to track and monitor. Then, specify a particular user. It's a quick and easy way to boost your social monitoring efforts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Out User Sentiment</emphasis></p><p>Similarly, with the fierce competition for customer dollars, it's important to know what people think about your brand. If you want to know how people's sentiments are about a product or service, use sentiment filters. For example ' @amazon :) or @amazon :). Then, you'll see everything that people are saying about the target item, whether good or bad., Or double down on successful products, services, and strategies.</p><p/><p>You can also use this strategy to monitor customer sentiments about your competitors. Especially if you don't have sophisticated social monitoring software, or if it doesn't include Twitter coverage, this is a great strategy. You can also use sentiment information in real-time to interact with other Twitter users and address any concerns they may have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supercharge Your Customer Service</emphasis></p><p>If you sell a product or service and want to track what your customer's queries or complaints are on Twitter, use the advanced search feature. For example ' Use queries such as 'customer service' or 'customer support' followed by your company name. </p><p/><p>A lot of companies use this approach at some level. <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/blog/how-twitter-has-become-a-key-customer-support-channel.html\">Twitter is often the best way for people to reach customer service </url>. And while this trend may move on to other platforms as usage patterns change, using Twitter Advanced search to look for ways to help your customers is still a very practical approach.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Your Competitors' Tweets</emphasis></p><p>If you keep a tab on what your competitors are up to on Twitter, use the option 'All of these words' and enter your keyword, and then use 'People' to enter your competitor's Twitter handle to check their tweets quickly. </p><p/><p>There are several reasons you might want to do this. For one thing, sometimes your competitors will talk about your brand as being inferior to theirs. Knowing what your competition says about you can help to counteract their efforts, either by correcting a misconception, fixing a problem, or countering their messaging with reasons why your product might be better than their product. The possibilities are endless.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find Photos or Videos Related to a Topic </emphasis></p><p>Most people think about Twitter in terms of text-based information and perhaps the links to other content like news stories. However, there's a lot more than Twitter has to offer, such as embedded photos and videos. Sometimes, you can find influencers and fans using this approach. And in turn, monitoring photos and videos can reveal valuable information.</p><p/><p>Ready to unleash the power of media on Twitter? Use the Twitter Advanced search bar to find photos or videos on any given topic or keyword. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Search for What Your Potential Customers may be Looking for</emphasis></p><p>Sometimes it's hard to predict what your customers want. While we put out surveys and hold focus groups, there's a lot of information that we'll only get spontaneously. In particular, people talk to their friends and social media contacts about the things that they need. And because those individuals are likely unbiased, users feel that they can speak more freely. For marketers, this information is a goldmine.</p><p/><p>You could search for what people have been looking to find on Twitter by using search terms such as 'How do I?,' and 'Any advice on' + keyword. You might also consider using the term 'review' in the context of the product. You never know what you'll find out.</p><p/><p>For example ' 'Any recommendations on finding an SEO tool?' We, marketers, tend to have strong opinions about various tech tools, so a question like this is sure to foster discussion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Using Twitter Advanced search is a potentially valuable tool for almost any marketer. Fortunately, it is also easy to use and costs nothing more than staff time. In many ways, this tool is only limited by your imagination and your ability to analyze the information gained.

I'm Fredericka Whitfield. The CNN NEWSROOM continues next with Jessica Dean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington. Jim Acosta has the day off. And we begin with developing news and the most significant indication yet that a fourth indictment against former President Donald Trump could be coming as soon as next week in Georgia. Former Georgia Lieutenant Governor and CNN Contributor Geoff Duncan revealing to CNN today, he will testify before grand jury in just a few days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I did just receive notification to appear on Tuesday morning at the Fulton County grand jury and I certainly will be there to do my part in recounting facts. I have no expectations as to the questions and I'll certainly answer whatever questions put in front of me and certainly don't want to go any deeper than that to, you know, jeopardize or compromise the investigation.</p><p>But look, for me this is a story that is important for Republicans to hear. Americans to hear. Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to seek multiple charges against Trump and his allies in the years long investigation into the efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. We have CNN reporter Marshall Cohen to break this all down and defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu for some legal analysis. Great to have both of you.</p><p>Marshall, let's start first you set the scene for us. Walk us through the significance of what we've learned today. MARSHALL COHEN, CNN REPORTER: After all the talk, all the prep, all the witnesses all the litigation. It's finally happening. It's finally here. Based off the notifications that were sent today to those grand jury witnesses, it appears that the Monday-Tuesday Grand Jury down in Atlanta and Fulton County that meets regularly is going to get the Trump case. Those witnesses were told to come in Tuesday.</p><p>The grand jurors will be there Monday presumably for meeting with the prosecutors and Fani Willis and her team or they will spell out what they think is a strong case of election subversion by Donald Trump and many of his allies for what they did in 2020 down in Georgia.</p><p>DEAN: And we know as we just talked about that Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor, CNN contributor is going to be talking to that grand jury. We also have learned there's a second person that's set to testify. What can you tell us about that?</p><p>COHEN: That's right. A second person who will go in on Tuesday, they announce it on their social media. His name is George Chidi. He's an independent journalist based in Atlanta. He's interesting because he actually witnessed the fake electors meeting in the state house. He sort of stumbled upon them midway through the plot back in December of 2020. Presumably he'll be testifying about that element of the multi- pronged attempt to interfere with the election.</p><p>DEAN: Fascinating. He just stumbled upon it being there. And then --</p><p>COHEN: He was doing his job. Journalist.</p><p>DEAN: Right. Just doing his job. Shan, let's talk about what this is going to look like for Chidi, for Duncan, what can -- what can they expect on Monday and Tuesday?</p><p>SHAN WU, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, first, it is still theoretically possible that they -- maybe they won't go in the grand jury. They've been subpoenaed. This is the regular grand jury, what I call the indicting grand jury. And they may have had access to all of the previous testimony in the form of written transcripts or listening to it. They could be read in, that's when -- the terms we use.</p><p>But the prosecutor may also be preparing for the fact that the grand jury may ask the -- live witnesses and they may want to have live witnesses to make a more powerful presentation. What they will inspect, cannot go in with counsel, your lawyer isn't allowed in there. It's usually a group of people, there's no judge in there. And depending on the way it's set up, it could look a little bit like a classroom. Sometimes there's just a room with a table.</p><p>And you as the witness are sitting there. They'll let you take breaks to ask your lawyers questions and such. But essentially, the prosecutor is there, kind of like an emcee in that circumstance. Prosecutor will be asking questions and then also kind of field any questions that the grand jurors themselves may have. So there's actually an air of informality compared to being in a trial situation and testifying. But at the same time, it can be fairly tense because it is a formal court proceeding. DEAN: Yes. And so interesting to remember that these grand jurors are afforded the opportunity to ask their own questions in this situation. Sources are telling CNN that the district attorney is expected to seek more than a dozen indictments and has been eyeing these conspiracy and racketeering charges against Trump and some of his allies. How much of a challenge, Shan, do you think that is for the Trump team to defend against if that -- if that is indeed what happens?</p><p>[16:05:03]</p><p>And also, racketeering charges that's a tough -- that's tough to prosecute and it's probably tough to defend against.</p><p>WU: Yes. I think the challenge on both sides for that kind of charge is the conspiracy element of it. So really challenging for the prosecution, make sure that you can show there really is a conspiracy. People are communicating through taking overt actions. On the defense side, very challenging, because when you have other people that were involved with you talking about it, that makes it much hard for you to do the denial aspect of it.</p><p>If as expected, we're going see multiple indictments. I mean, this looks like the kind of case Jack Smith would have done if he didn't have a ticking clock shortening his charges.</p><p>DEAN: That is interesting. So that's -- that kind of leads us into a good question for Marshall, which is, we do have -- just to remind everyone, this would be the fourth indictment. The fourth case. If we could go to the most recent one this third case that is here in D.C. with Jack Smith on 2020 and overturning the election. How does this differ from that federal indictment that we've already seen?</p><p>COHEN: It's hard to keep track.</p><p>DEAN: It is.</p><p>COHEN: Former President Donald Trump was indicted several weeks ago, federally here in the District of Columbia by the Justice Department in connection with the national plot to subvert the election, in the words of the prosecutor to disenfranchise voters and change the electoral count illegally. That's federal. A lot of the Georgia activities were in that indictment. You can read that -- read it for yourself.</p><p>You can see what Donald Trump said to Brad Raffensperger, the Secretary of State trying to twist his arm to flip those votes. It's all in the federal indictment. Those are federal charges. This is a state investigation. Of course, the question on everyone's mind is, if Trump wins next year, he would be the chief executive of the United States and theoretically would have the power to shut down the federal probe, maybe even pardon himself. Can't do that in Georgia.</p><p>DEAN: So that's -- Shan, walk us through that because that is the big difference here that it is a state probe versus a federal probe. And if he is elected because let us remember, he is running to be President of the United States and is currently leading the GOP field by a very wide margin and a lot of polls. But the Georgia indictment and if there was -- that if they were able to prosecute this successfully, that would stick even if he was president.</p><p>WU: Yes. It's the dual sovereign concept. I mean, Georgia as a state is a different sovereign than the United States of America. And so that's why sometimes you might even hear people talking about that wasn't a double jeopardy if someone's tried once by state, once by the feds. It's not because there are different governments really that way. And while it's true that, you know, Trump could try this untested route of pardoning himself. You'd have no shot at all trying to do that with a state prosecution.</p><p>DEAN: And what do we know, Shan, about this judge in this federal case? Because we have seen this judge that's overseeing that case, issue of protective order that's barring Trump from publicly disclosing some of the sensitive information. And she's even gone as far as to say that if Trump makes any inflammatory statements that she could speed up the trial, which is what we know that Trump and his defense team does not want. What do you make of how she's approaching this?</p><p>WU: Well, Judge Chutkan, a very experienced trial attorney. I was a prosecutor when she was in the Public Defender Service. And that's really one of the most storied public defender services in the country. I was rejected when I applied just full disclosure. But she's very, very skilled. And she really knows her way around the courtroom as a prosecutor -- excuse me, as a defense counsel. And I think you see that in the way that she's dealing with this very complex high- profile case.</p><p>It's clear that she's not going to put up with delays which aren't justified. But as a former defense counsel, she's going to make sure she protects the Trump team's rights as well, which is why she narrowed down what the prosecution wanted more of a blanket protective order. And she said, no, show me what's really sensitive and those things won't be disclosed. Now, I do have a little bit of skepticism with her making that statement, if you're going to make inflammatory remarks, then we're going to speed up the trial.</p><p>She can certainly discipline him, sanction him, even put him in jail for those kinds of remarks. From an appellate standpoint, if you rushed the defense as kind of a punishment for making these bad remarks, it could create a problem if they get a conviction on appeal. So, I'm not sure if that one has much teeth.</p><p>DEAN: That's a very good point to make. And Marshall, I know you've also been keeping your eye on the president's son, Hunter Biden, and all of the legal cases surrounding him. We saw that special counsel appointed this week. What do you make of the Justice Department's decision?</p><p>COHEN: Let's just remember the crazy moment we're living in. There are three special counsels right now in the Justice Department investigating the president for possibly mishandling classified documents. The president's son for his tax problems and the former president, Donald Trump. [16:10:07]</p><p>The Hunter Biden situation, look, just three weeks ago, it appeared that this thing was basically done. A plea deal, a controversial plea deal, but a deal that was heading towards approval with the judge. It derailed in court three weeks ago. They tried to negotiate an agreement in the last few weeks. But we learned from court filings yesterday that those talks had collapsed. And what we learned from the Attorney General Merrick Garland was that it was now time to take that prosecutor and turn him to a special counsel, potentially, to take this case to trial.</p><p>And if he does, if they can't figure out a deal, then that will be very bad for the President and his son because we were talking about misdemeanors. And if this is going to trial, it is probably going to be felonies.</p><p>DEAN: And Shan, do you feel like the Attorney General Merrick Garland was really forced his hand here like he had -- he had to do this and what do you expect in the coming weeks and months in that particular case?</p><p>WU: I am puzzled as to why the Attorney General did this. Obviously, if he was asked by Weiss, I get the fact he would feel like he couldn't refuse, it would look bad. But to me, he -- Merrick Garland could have on day one appointed a special counsel and say, look, it's the president's son, I want to push it off arm's length. He didn't. He kept on the Trump prosecutor, which was very good. Let Weiss do his thing.</p><p>I'm not sure why it changes his mind now. Weiss could have tried the case outside the jurisdiction. In fact, he and Garland both said --</p><p>COHEN: Many times.</p><p>WU: Many times knows his authority for the asking. So, I'm not sure why that would make the deal unquestioned for Biden. It's not a good look for a son. It's not a good look because if the plea bargain breaks down, they're always going to charge you with more serious crimes before. So that definitely puts them in jeopardy. On the other hand, his defense counsel, if I was defense counsel, I wouldn't be running too scared because I'd say look, you've had five years to investigate this case.</p><p>This is the best you've come up with. So fine, you really want to try my client on tax charges when you already paid back the taxes, be my guess.</p><p>DEAN: Yes. There's so much to watch and track. Thanks to both of you, Shan Wu and Marshall Cohen. Great to have you both here with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>And while the grand jury is getting ready to meet in Georgia, Donald Trump is in Iowa with other Republican candidates. We're going to take you there live. That's next. Plus, the rising death toll from the Maui wildfires. We're going to talk live with a photographer on the island who's documenting that tragedy in real time. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:16:38]</p><p>DEAN: Former President Donald Trump drawing huge crowds of supporters at the Iowa State Fair. Of course, this coming after former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan revealed to CNN today he's been called to testify before Fulton County grand jury about Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN political director David Chalian who has been there at the Iowa State Fair taking it all in, seeing all of the candidates. And David, let's just start by zeroing in on this incredible split screen, which is the former president in Iowa campaigning for -- to be the nominee yet again, ahead of what could possibly be his fourth criminal indictment.</p><p>DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: It is quite the split screen, Jessica. There's no doubt about that. And it kind of captures the picture of the 2024 campaign that Donald Trump, the frontrunner both nationally and here in Iowa, the kickoff state to the process has all of these legal woes looming over his head and most pressingly now, this next potential fourth indictment in Georgia this week.</p><p>And yet here he is making his way through the fairgrounds getting a groundswell of support, huge crowds as the president -- the former president tends to get at events like this. And he is using the indictments as political fuel for his campaign. He is making his legal troubles, Jessica, a political cause. And it is helping his grassroots donations, and it is fortifying his base of support as he portrays it as sort of a political prosecution against him.</p><p>DEAN: Right. It's like a playbook now. Every time he gets indicted, we see him running that playbook. David, when I've been there in Iowa, I have not heard the voters particularly focused on indictment or this or that. When it comes to Trump's legal trouble, they talk about him. They talk about whether they have fatigue for -- around him or if they've -- maybe they're really still solidly in his camp.</p><p>What is your sense from voters as you're talking to them at the fair and now that we're just, you know, a few months out from the caucuses?</p><p>CHALIAN: Jessica, I'm so glad you raised that because I have not found a voter who brings up the indictments to me. He asked -- when we asked about it, they'll answer some questions about it. But I -- but I think it is worth noting. This is while it is dominating Trump's day to day life, obviously because he has a legal strategy to put in place and it is massive news and headlines. It's not what is top of mind for a lot of potential caucus goers here.</p><p>And that's also why I don't think we see a lot of his Republican competitors, all that eager to contrast with Trump on the issue of the indictments. They make the argument perhaps that they don't think he's going to be the best position to win for the party in 2024. Our colleague Kyung Lah asked some voters specifically about the indictment news. Give a listen to what they have to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Like I said, I know in my area, it's Trump country.</p><p>KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Are the indictments changing how you feel?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, because I do think a lot of that is for a fact.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of those are trumped up. I don't find the charges against him being trumped up at all. That's my opinion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:20:01]</p><p>CHALIAN: So, you hear there in that voter's opinion, it doesn't sway her. She's clearly supportive of the former president. You hear some others say that, perhaps it could be a distraction. And it might be better to have a candidate that doesn't have to balance the campaign trail with going into the courtroom, Jessica. But by looks of the crowds today, by where he is in the polls right now, right now, at this race with five months ago, Donald Trump's the leading contender for the nomination and here in Iowa.</p><p>DEAN: Right. And it has been so consistent over the last several months leading up to now. It will be interesting to see if it stays that way. And in the months leading up to the actual caucuses. Before you go, David, I do want to ask you about his Republican rivals, because all of them are there. They're all trying to break through with voters in Iowa. What are any takeaways that you're seeing either from his chief rival Ron DeSantis or others as they really try to make a difference in their standing with voters there?</p><p>CHALIAN: Yes. And there was such a contrast on display today. Donald Trump was in and out of Iowa. I think maybe he was on the ground in Iowa for about two hours. He was here at the fair for less time than that. Ron DeSantis had been on the fairgrounds for more than four hours today. Shaking hands, he's with his kids and his wife. He's making a clear just by image, generational argument.</p><p>You saw him in the bumper cars that sort of was evoking the images of the young Obama family back in 2007 at times. And that is an argument DeSantis is clearly making that it is time for change. He also took Trump on pretty directly about not signing that RNC loyalty pledge to get on the debate stage. We don't know if Trump will be there. But DeSantis is making the argument. You know, you've got to think about the hole here of trying to defeat Joe Biden.</p><p>And not just yourself that there may be people you don't want to support on the debate stage. And he was needling Donald Trump for not signing that loyalty pledge saying he's putting himself ahead of the party and therefore the country. But you are seeing Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Pence. The whole slew of candidates are out here. They're doing the glad handing and they are trying to sort of wage a traditional campaign and we know this campaign is anything but traditional.</p><p>DEAN: Yes. You hit the nail on the head there. That's exactly right. It's traditional campaigning in a very non-traditional moment. David Chalian for us at the Iowa State Fair this weekend. Thanks so much.</p><p>Well, the death toll in Maui now stands at 80 from the devastating wildfires there. An update there next. We're also going to speak with a man who's documenting the tragedy. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:26:45]</p><p>DEAN: Right now, utter devastation in Hawaii as it battles its deadliest natural disaster ever. As of this hour, the death toll from this week's wildfires has reached at least 80. And the economic toll on Maui County alone has eclipsed an estimated $5-1/2 billion. As teams searched the area of Lahaina now with the help of cadaver dogs, we're seeing more video of harrowing escapes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We got to walk somewhere over there by the beach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to (BLEEP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh (BLEEP) M.G., wrong turn, wrong turn.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: M.G., M.G., M.G.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh (BLEEP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just keep going.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh (BLEEP) no, no, no, no, no, no, not like this.

No. Get out of the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (BLEEP) see?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God (BLEEP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: Just horrific. More than a dozen federal agencies including FEMA and the National Guard have now been mobilized to help with those recovery efforts. CNN Mike Valerio is on the ground in Maui.</p><p>MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jessica, this is the main roadway that leads into Lahaina. It's about a 20-minute drive that way but if we spin around, this is what people who work and live in Lahaina are having to deal with. A queue, a line to get in that spans right now about a mile and a half behind us. So, what you need to know is that people have been waiting to get in for more than 14 hours in some cases.</p><p>As we Zoom in, you can see a mix of utility workers, families, parents, college kids, people who are just waiting to see if their home survived the inferno. Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning. We spoke with two drivers before dawn. One of them ended up making it in the other did not because of a traffic jam after this roadway. The Honoapiilani highway was reopened just after dawn today. Listen to what both of those drivers told us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK THURSTON, MAUI RESIDENT: I got out here by 11:00, made it all the way to the other side. I was done by 3:00 picking up all the supplies I got. And then got to here and I've been here since 3:00 in the afternoon.</p><p>VALERIO: You've been here since 3:00.</p><p>THURSTON: Yes. We -- nobody -- none of us has moved. My coworker. She's up there two trucks. My other -- I got three other coworkers down there. They're back there. They've been here the whole time.</p><p>TODD DOMECK, MAUI RESIDENT: It's either laughter or tears, you know. So when I talk to all the people in our business that have been affected, about 14 people that have lost their houses. And so, we're just trying to do the most good we can, but it's really frustrating when you can't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VALERIO: So in terms of the wider picture, there are new figures that are out from FEMA estimating that it's going to cost $5.52 billion to rebuild Lahaina. 227 structures either damaged or destroyed. 4500 people. That is the estimate for the number of people who need to be sheltered in both the near and the long term. But this, what we are seeing here is the first chapter to both rebuilding, seeing what survived and seeing what is left of a place that was so integral to the heart and soul of Maui. Jessica?</p><p>[16:30:01]</p><p>DEAN: Mike Valerio for us. Just so much need there.</p><p>Thank you so much.</p><p>My next guest is a resident of Maui, Daniel Sullivan.</p><p>Daniel, thanks so much for making time for us this afternoon. You posted on your Instagram that it was one of the most terrifying nights of your life. You were surrounded by three raging fires at once. Will you just tell us about that moment?</p><p>DANIEL SULLIVAN, MAUI RESIDENT: Yes, we were really -- it was a difficult spot. We had -- the winds that started in the afternoon had knocked down many trees, so many of the roads were blocked.</p><p>And then the fires were - well, we had a big fire below the House. We had one coming from one direction, and then we had a big forest fire above us.</p><p>And no one was sure, you know, how fast that was traveling. They said, you know, if it's two miles away, you've got to evacuate. And we could see flames.</p><p>And I just sat up on my roof that night and end up photographing -- I'm a professional photographer here. And just with my family down below, we had the van packed.</p><p>The problem is we couldn't get out. The roads were blocked. There was really nowhere to because we were completely surrounded by fires.</p><p>DEAN: Just the videos and photos are absolutely overwhelming. I understand your home is OK, which is great news. And I'm so happy for you and your family.</p><p>But I think what you're talking about is like having your car packed and knowing you may have to go, but you couldn't. There's no roads. The fires are just enclosing all around. That must have been really, really scary.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Yes, it was terrifying. The whole island was in that situation, you know? People had even gotten away to evacuate at the shelters were then being evacuated because the shelters were burning.</p><p>It was just -- nobody had seen anything like it. The winds were just so strong and that fire was just whipping around the island.</p><p>And we were just all affected by it. This whole island's been affected, you know, so terribly by this fire.</p><p>DEAN: There's no question about it.</p><p>And you mentioned you're a professional photographer. We know that you've been documenting this to the extent that you can. Walk us through what you've be able to see as you've been documenting this.</p><p>SULLIVAN: So yesterday I was up with the firefighters. There's still fires up there. These guys have been working around the clock since Tuesday, you know, fighting these fires. A lot of them haven't slept.</p><p>I went out with the firefighters. We were hiking around some of the hot -- helicopters dropping, you know, hundreds of gallons of water, just trying to stay on top of it. You know, the winds are the real enemy up there. And luckily, we had a couple of calm days, which was good. That kind of helped them to get on top of the fires.</p><p>These are big forest fires. This isn't something we are used to.</p><p>When these trees are so hot, is what happens is the roots burn underneath. So under the ground those roots are burning and it can jump up anywhere and you have these fires that would start.</p><p>And you would think there's no fire there, but when you take the temperature of the soil, it's 180, 200 degrees, the soil, because those roots are burning.</p><p>DEAN: That's incredible.</p><p>And just quickly, before we let you go, there are so many people that are watching you right now and have been watching this over the last couple of days, and they feel kind of helpless. This feels so awful because you're so far away in Maui.</p><p>How can they help you? What do you all need right now from people?</p><p>SULLIVAN: I mean, it's such a hard question because we feel the same way. You know, we were so lucky not to lose our home. You know, my wife's been volunteering down at the shelter.</p><p>It's just -- it's so hard because you know, there's a lot of donations and this island really has so much love, you know, everybody's coming together to support.</p><p>But, you know, you're talking about thousands of people. And this island, we're only, you know, 160,000 people. We're really small. So it's a tough question.</p><p>You know, there's going to need to be shelter. There's going to be -- all these things. The entire town was wiped out. There's nothing over there.</p><p>If you look at, like, the supply list, people are asking for barbecues, you know, just to cook food because they have no electricity, no running water.</p><p>I grew up in New Orleans, so I was there after Katrina, and I've seen, you know, what it looks like. And it's like Katrina. You know, it's wiped out. There's nothing left.</p><p>I think there's so much that's needed and we're just beginning to learn about, you know, the losses we've had here. It's a really hard situation.</p><p>DEAN: It is. It is devastating. And it sounds like just basic needs at this point. It's a struggle to meet those.</p><p>Daniel, thank you so much for talking with us. Our best to you and your family and to all of your neighbors there in Maui. Thanks again. [16:35:04]</p><p>SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>DEAN: And for more information about how you can help the wildfire victims in Hawaii, you can go to CNN.com/impact. You can also text the word \"Hawaii\" to 707070 to donate.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEAN: There are major new developments in what could soon be Donald Trump's fourth indictment.</p><p>Just a short time ago, CNN spoke with former Georgia lieutenant governor and CNN contributor, Geoff Duncan. He said he will testify in the next 48 hours before a grand jury in Atlanta.</p><p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.</p><p>Duncan, as I mentioned, is now a CNN political commentator.</p><p>[16:40:00]</p><p>We also know an independent journalist tweeted today he was also called by the Fulton County district attorney and also asked to testify before that Same grand jury on Tuesday.</p><p>Meantime, multiple White House aides are telling CNN the Biden administration is preparing to roll out a massive expansion of background checks for gun purchases.</p><p>According to those sources, the Biden campaign is working toward making gun safety a central issue in his re-election campaign.</p><p>And several people advising the campaign telling CNN that gun safety along with abortion are Biden's opportunity to characterize Republicans as extreme.</p><p>CNN's senior reporter, Edward-Isaac Dovere, broke this story.</p><p>Isaac, great to see you.</p><p>EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Yes.</p><p>DEAN: Tell us what your sources are saying about this. This is interesting.</p><p>DOVERE: This is an executive action that Biden started the process on in March but looks like it's about to be approved through the internal process. The administration is going to be talking more about it. The president's going to be talking more about it. It's going to happen at the same time the Biden campaign and the political arena will be talking about gun control much more and gun safety much more.</p><p>To them, this as you say, is an opportunity to say that Republicans are out of whack with the mainstream.</p><p>When you look at the mass shootings, the homicides, all these things that have really changed this issue and that Biden really wants to try to tap into and say that the Republicans need to catch up to where people overall have come to on this issue.</p><p>DEAN: And what are you hearing from Democratic leadership outside of the White House?</p><p>DOVERE: There's a feeling of exhaustion from a lot of Americans and certainly political leaders about this.</p><p>I spoke with the mayor of Baltimore who said to me that he is so tired of gun violence on the streets of Baltimore and other cities that he feels like mayors need to stand up and say there's blood on the hands literally of the people who are stopping more legislation on gun control.</p><p>Senator Chris Murphy, who's very associated with a senator from Connecticut, say that they feel like this is a way for Democrats politically not just to about the importance of winning the presidency.</p><p>But to make a play for House races around the country and Senate races and make this really into a litmus test issue for a lot of voters.</p><p>DEAN: It is interesting they are choosing those two issues.</p><p>Because when you look at the data, Republicans in their positioning is out of step with where the majority of Americans are, not all Americans, but the majority of Americans.</p><p>And we saw that play out in the midterms with abortion.</p><p>DOVERE: Yes.</p><p>DEAN: So now to kind of couple that issue, which our CNN data shows is still as potent with voters, with this gun control issue, it is an interesting -- it is an interesting choice.</p><p>DOVERE: Remember, in 2020, Biden talked about the battle for the soul of America. I wrote a book about it called \"Battle for the Soul.\"</p><p>DEAN: I remember that. Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOVERE: They are going to be talking about it a lot more in sort of a renewed way. And the president, you'll hear him talk about it. And think about the contrast -- and some of the Biden advisers that I've talked to have talked about this contrast between talking about the battle for the soul of America, talking guns as part of that.</p><p>And on the opposite side of it, you have the leading Republican candidate, former President Trump, who will, it seems like be on trial for his role in what was a violent insurrection at the capitol.</p><p>DEAN: It is shaping up to be just absolutely an unprecedented election cycle.</p><p>Isaac, thanks so much.</p><p>DOVERE: Thanks.</p><p>DEAN: We appreciate it. Good to see you.</p><p>And for the first time, there may be a complicating factor in upcoming elections. Artificial intelligence, it could play a major role in the 2024 election. That prospect has caught the eye of federal regulators who, this week, took the first steps toward regulating the use of A.I. in political ads.</p><p>CNN's Jon Sarlin is joining us with details on this.</p><p>Jon, walk us through what's happening here. Because we've seen some of this A.I. in ads so far. It is so eerily realistic looking. What's happening with this?</p><p>JON SARLIN, CNN BUSINESS PRODUCER: Right, that is the key. The technology now allows you to create misrepresentations with video, with audio that seemed to be from one person but is artificially generated.</p><p>Is that allowed in a campaign? That is the key question. Well, the FEC now is taking a potential small step to regulating that.</p><p>The bipartisan commission has opened a 60-day public comment on whether existing federal regulations apply to A.I. in elections.</p><p>As you mentioned, we've seen, as this technology has rapidly improved, it starts to work its way into campaigns.</p><p>The Ron DeSantis campaign tweeted out a video that had A.I. images of Donald Trump hugging Anthony Fauci. Those were fake.</p><p>Previously, we've seen the RNC create an A.I.-generated ad about Joe Biden.</p><p>The question, though, is that legal? I've talked to election experts on this, and they say, look, lying in election ads is legal. That is the issue. What is not allowed is fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation.</p><p>[16:44:59]</p><p>And a nonpartisan group, Public Citizen, and a group of Democratic lawmakers led by Adam Schiff are arguing that A.I.-generated ads are fraudulent misrepresentations.</p><p>Now, the FEC is a bipartisan commission. It's split half between Democrats and Republicans. And it seems like there are disagreements on whether fraud applies to A.I. in ads.</p><p>DEAN: We're seeing it more and more where the technology gets ahead of where the regulation is, where the laws are.</p><p>Before you go, I do want to ask you about this. Cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried's bail was revoked this week. He was sent back to jail, being accused of witness tampering. What can you tell us about that?</p><p>SARLIN: That's right. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, now disgraced, he was facing his trial in October, is now in federal custody in Brooklyn.</p><p>That's after prosecutors and then a judge said that Sam Bankman- Fried's repeated reach out to journalists crossed the line into witness tampering.</p><p>Now, Sam Bankman-Fried had made over a thousand calls to journalists in recent months according to prosecutors.</p><p>And at the heart of that was Caroline Ellison, his former lover and the former co-CEO of Alameda Research, the hedge fund that he, Sam Bankman-Fried, founded and funded and was key to the prosecutor's indictment of him.</p><p>Now Caroline Ellison, in December, pleaded guilty to charges against her with the understanding that she would cooperate with the government's case against Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>Well, Sam Bankman-Fried was telling journalists about Caroline Ellison, including giving personal documents of hers.</p><p>A profile in \"The New York Times\" came out about Caroline Ellison. The government said this is not protected speech, which is what Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyers argued, First Amendment rights to protect his reputation.</p><p>Prosecutors said that was witness tampering, and had sent messages to other witnesses who were reticent to testify against Sam Bankman-Fried in October.</p><p>DEAN: So many layers there.</p><p>All right, Jon Sarlin, for us. Thanks so much for that reporting. We appreciate it.</p><p>Well, gas prices are rising in some parts of the country but falling in others. We'll break that all down for you, next.</p><p>You're in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:51:40]</p><p>DEAN: If you plan on doing any driving this summer, be aware gas prices are up in a lot of areas.</p><p>Take a look at this map from AAA. You'll see the dark red. It indicates states where the gas prices are the highest. The dark blue, that's where they're the lowest for regular unleaded.</p><p>The cheapest gas has been found in the south, with Mississippi clocking in at $3.32. AAA finding the highest prices in the western states. In California, $5.13. And you'll pay a full $1.81 more than you would in Mississippi.</p><p>We'll talk now with Patrick De Haan. He's the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.</p><p>Great to see you, Patrick. Thanks so much for joining us this afternoon.</p><p>I want to bring that map back up for a second. We know that GasBuddy is reporting a rise in prices in some states this month compared to August of last year. But then we've got this drop in other states.</p><p>What do you make of that? Is there a reason for this?</p><p>PATRICK DE HAAN, HEAD OF PETROLEUM ANALYSIS, GASBUDDY: Well, as you look at it, some of these states are now starting to get back beyond where they were a year ago.</p><p>And unfortunately, with gas prices likely to see more upward pressure as the price of oil continues to push things up, we're going to see more states get into that territory.</p><p>Ironically, out west, as you just mentioned, California some of the nation's highest prices.</p><p>California is not one of the states that's above a year ago. And a lot of it has to do with refinery issues that may have happened last year that are absent this year or quite the opposite.</p><p>This year, there are some refinery issues in areas of the south because of the tremendous temperatures that we've seen that has slowed down and curtailed refinery's ability to produce gasoline.</p><p>And some of those areas are now seeing prices high they are year due to some of those snags compared to where they were last year.</p><p>But unfortunately, I do think that for all the inflation data that we're seeing, unfortunately, we're going to likely start closing the gap. The national average today now only $0.13 below where it was a year ago.</p><p>DEAN: Got you.</p><p>It is interesting, though, because we're looking at California, for example, I was actually there last weekend and the gas prices caught my eye, and saying, oh my gosh, it's so high.</p><p>But you're saying it's still actually lower than it was this time last year there?</p><p>DE HAAN: Yes, that's right. California's about $0.30 a gallon lower. But if you look at it compared to what we were, say, a week ago, there's about 25 states that are seeing higher prices this week compared to last year, and about 25 below that.</p><p>The only good news really is that only about nine states so far have seen their average gas prices go up beyond what they were a year ago.</p><p>Again, a lot of this happening baud because of Saudi-led production cuts that they just extended into September.</p><p>So motorists may not see much of a break here at a time of the year that we usually see gas prices easing going into the closing end of driving season and you have hurricane season as well.</p><p>DEAN: Right. And that's certainly something to keep in mind.</p><p>OK, so look at your crystal ball for us, and if you look out at the next several weeks or a month even, what should people expect then?</p><p>DE HAAN: I think, for the next few weeks, it's going to be a bit volatile. Because we've seen the price of oil move higher for six straight weeks. So bottom line, don't expect any price relief just yet.</p><p>But I do think once we get into mid and late September, we should see some price relief. And that has to do with demand for gasoline that is going to start declining as schools reopen.</p><p>In addition, the key mark is when we switch back to cheaper winter gasoline. That happens September 16th.</p><p>So between now and then, hold your breath. Hopefully, we'll not see any major hurricanes. More relief should arrive in the fall.</p><p>[16:55:03]</p><p>DEAN: All right. Patrick De Haan, thank you for breaking that all down for us. We appreciate it.</p><p>DE HAAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>DEAN: And new developments today in what could become Donald Trump's fourth indictment as the Republican frontrunner arrived in Iowa along with other presidential candidates. We have an update next, on CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEAN: You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington. Jim Acosta has the day off.</p><p>[16:59:55]</p><p>And we are following a major development in what could become the fourth indictment of former President Donald Trump. The strongest indication yet coming from former lieutenant governor of Georgia and CNN contributor, Geoff Duncan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

In much of the region, plants that fuel fires are also the driest scientists have seen. The vegetation is primed to ignite, especially in the Southwest where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/prescott/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD904406\">dead juniper trees</url> are full of flammable needles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt\u2019s like having gasoline out there,\u201d said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona.</p><p>A climate change-fueled megadrought of more than 20 years is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists said. Rainfall in the Rockies and farther west was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/regional/time-series/120/pcp/1/4/1895-2021?base_prd=true&amp;begbaseyear=1901&amp;endbaseyear=2000\">second lowest</url> on record in April, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>\u201cIt means that the dice are loaded toward a lot of forest fire this year,\u201d said Park Williams, a UCLA climate and fire scientist, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/peedublya/status/1391860524388806656\">calculated that soil</url> in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. \u201cThis summer we\u2019re going into fire season with drier fuels than we were at this time last year.\u201d</p><p>In addition, the western drought is deepening week by week.</p><p> In late March, less than one-third of California was suffering extreme or exceptional drought. Now more than 73% is, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx\">National Drought Monitor</url>, which is based on precipitation, temperature, soil moisture and streamflow measurements. A year ago, heading into the record-smashing 2020 fire year when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/\">more than 4% of California burned</url>, just 3% of the state was in extreme or exceptional drought.</p><p>But the outlook is worse elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cI think the Southwest is really primed for a bad fire season,\u201d University of Utah fire scientist Phil Dennison said. That\u2019s because last year\u2019s normal monsoon season, which brings much of the year\u2019s rainfall, never showed up.</p><p>A year ago, none of Arizona, Nevada and Utah was in extreme or exceptional drought, but now more than 90% of Utah, 86% of Arizona and 75% of Nevada is in those highest drought categories, according to the drought monitor. New Mexico jumped from 4% extreme or exceptional drought a year ago to more than 77% now.</p><p>UCLA meteorologist Daniel Swain, who also works for the National Center for Atmospheric Research and The Nature Conservancy, said key factors going into fire season are soil and plant wetness.</p><p>\u201cSo is soil moisture very low? Is vegetation extremely dry? Absolutely, yes. Unequivocally, yes. Pretty much everywhere in California and the Southwest,\" Swain said. \u201cSo that box is checked big time in a way that is going to massively increase the potential background flammability ... given a spark, given extreme weather conditions.\u201d</p><p>This doesn\u2019t necessarily ensure the 2021 fire season will be worse than 2020. Last year more than 15,800 square miles (40,960 square kilometers) of the United States burned, an area about the size of Maryland and Delaware combined. Several scientists said last year\u2019s fires were stoked not just by hot, dry conditions, but by unusual situations that made a bad year horrific:</p><p>Two intense heat waves \u2014 one that nearly set a record for hottest temperature on Earth in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-featured-weather-california-3bca83b93a5b3fd967fd97a65a8de2cb\">Death Valley</url> \u2014 set the stage, and a freak California lightning barrage provided lots of spark.</p><p>The lightning outbreak was the type that has happened only a few times in history and is unlikely to occur two years in a row, Swain said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be the hottest summer,\" he said, adding. \u201cI\u2019m really grasping at straws here. All we have going for us is dumb luck.\u201d</p><p>When the scientists see extremely dry or dying trees, they get even more worried.</p><p>In Arizona, junipers are succumbing to the 20-year drought and its two-year intensification, said Joel McMillin, a forest health zone leader for the U.S. Forest Service there. Officials haven\u2019t done a precise count but anecdotally the die-off is 5% to 30% with some patches up to 60%.</p><p>Until the dead needles drop to the ground, which takes a year or so, the fire hazard increases, fire manager Steinhardt said. \u201cSo you have something that\u2019s highly flammable and it\u2019s ... 20-, 30-, 40-foot tall and every single one of those needles on there now becomes an ember that can be launched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably one of the driest and potentially most challenging situations I\u2019ve been in,\u201d said the veteran of 32 fire seasons.</p><p>In California, normally drought-tolerant blue oaks are dying around the San Francisco Bay Area, said Scott Stephens, a fire science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to water. Soil moisture is so low. When you start to see blue oak dying, that gets your attention.\u201d</p><p>Human-caused climate change and decades of fire suppression that increases fuel loads are aggravating fire conditions across the West, scientists said.</p><p>Global warming has contributed to the megadrought and is making plants more prone to burning.</p><p>Normally a good part of the sun\u2019s energy removes water from plants and soil, but when they are already dry, that energy instead makes the air hotter, which creates a feedback loop, Swain said.</p><p>And drier conditions lead to beetle infestations that further weaken and kill trees, said University of Utah's Dennison.</p><p>For decades, U.S. firefighting agencies have tried to put out fires as quickly as possible, and that's usually worked, UCLA's Williams said. But the practice resulted in the buildup of dense trees, brush and other potential fire fuels.</p><p>\u201cFire is escaping our control increasingly frequently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of the reason for that might be because of increasing density of fuels. But we also see that these fires are escaping our control during record-breaking heat waves \u2014 and it\u2019s the warmest, driest years when we have the hardest time controlling fires.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Read stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate</url></p><p>___</p><p>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/borenbears\">@borenbears</url>.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

I'm Laila Harrak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former U.S. President Donald Trump is on the campaign trail in South Carolina as he faces several indictments, he is still railing against the special counsel investigating him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 1,000 wildfires burning in Canada right now. We'll hear how those blazes are affecting an indigenous community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Simone Biles is back, her return to competitive gymnastics.</p><p>Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was in South Carolina on Saturday night complaining once again about the numerous criminal indictments he's facing and calling on Republicans in Congress to do something. In addressing the friendly audience, Trump grossly understated the seriousness of the charges against him. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The fake charges put forth by the Biden sham, we call it a sham indictment, and the man that's -- I really believe he's mentally ill. But these are outrageous, and it is an outrageous criminalization of political speech. They're trying to make it illegal to question the results of an election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRAK: He's also lashing out at his former vice president, Mike Pence, who has increasingly been -- criticized Trump in his own bid for the White House. Trump posted one of his sharpest attacks yet on social media calling Pence delusional and not a very good person.</p><p>CNN's Alayna Treene was at the South Carolina event and has our report.</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: The former president spent much of his Saturday night speech railing against the recent charges that he faces as well as attacking Special Counsel Jack Smith directly. Donald Trump called him, quote, mentally ill as well as deranged.</p><p>Now, the former president also made an appeal to Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He argued that they needed to step up and do something in order to help defend him against his recent legal battles.</p><p>But one big thing that I find to be different from his speech on Saturday is it came less than 24 hours after Jack Smith wrote in a court filing asking a judge to set limits on what Trump's team can do with the evidence shared in the election subversion case.</p><p>Now, the judge ultimately ruled on Saturday that Donald Trump's team must respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon, but there were a lot of questions going into Saturday night, whether Donald Trump's team would encourage him to change his rhetoric in light of that court filing, but, clearly, he did not.</p><p>Alayna Treene, CNN, Columbia, South Carolina.</p><p>HARRAK: Ukraine says its air defenses fought off a Russian attack overnight. Kyiv says Russia launched two waves of strikes, one Saturday night and the other Sunday morning. But Ukraine shot down all 26 drones used in those strikes, and a majority of 40 cruise missiles.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia is claiming progress in Northeastern Ukraine. It says its troops captured a village in the Luhansk region on Saturday. Moscow also threatening with a response after what it calls a barbaric sea drone strike on one of its oil tankers.</p><p>But Ukraine is making it clear it only plans to scale up those attacks, and it's putting six Russian ports on notice that shipping in and out of them could be impacted by military operations.</p><p>Nada Bashir is monitoring events for you. She joins us now live from London. Good morning, Nada. Escalating attacks just as this peace summit is under way in Saudi?</p><p>NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: Absolutely. It's been another devastating night across Ukraine's eastern frontlines. We've heard from the Ukrainian Air Force. They've described what was a large-scale aerial attack by the Russian armed forces using both drones and missiles across Ukraine's eastern region to devastating effect. Although Ukraine has said that it managed to thwart dozens of aerial attacks using its air defense systems, but, of course, there has been devastation recorded as well.</p><p>President Zelenskyy addressing this, he spoke about an attack in Kharkiv targeting a blood transfusion center.</p><p>[03:05:02]</p><p>Now, he says that a Russian guided aerial bomb targeted the center, setting it ablaze, and, sadly, fatalities have been confirmed amongst the wounded, although no official figures on that just yet.</p><p>But Russia is also accusing Ukraine of its own round of attacks in the Southeastern Donetsk region. They say the Ukrainian armed forces targeted a university in Donetsk using what they claim to be cruise missiles as well as cluster munitions, though CNN has been unable to independently verify these claims. This has been reported in Russian state media and citing emergency services. They say that there were no people present inside the university at the time. But they say that the Donetsk region underwent several shelling attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. They say they recorded 48 attacks in total.</p><p>And, of course, southeast, in the Black Sea, tensions continue to bubble. We've seen those attacks by Ukrainian sea drones targeting Russian vessels. As you mentioned, Ukraine has said these plans could step up, because he continued attacks against Russian vessels using maritime drones there. We heard from the head of the Ukrainian Security Services as well as official sources speaking to CNN, saying that as long as there are Russian forces in Ukrainian waters, on Ukrainian land, these attacks will continue. And several Russian ports have been put on coastal alert. Officials saying that these are now conflict risk areas.</p><p>But Russia is vowing its own response. We've heard from the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, who said that these attacks will not go without a response, there will be retaliation and those responsible will be punished. But, of course, for Ukraine, this is a crucial element of their counteroffensive. They've described these sea drone attacks as a logical and effective step in this counteroffensive. Laila?</p><p>HARRAK: Nada Bashir reporting in London, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, now to a story of two soldiers, one Russian and one Ukrainian, both separated from their units after being wounded on the battlefield. One was saved by a Ukrainian drone, the other by Ukrainian troops.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It is usually only the dead lying here in the craters of Ukraine's southern front. But sometimes a glint of life shines. This drone spotting a Ukrainian soldier, Serhiy, separated from his unit. Wounded in the chest and leg by shelling, he filmed this as he lay alone bleeding. He feared whatever fight to live he put up would not be enough, he later told CNN from his hospital bed.</p><p>SERHIY, UKRAINIAN SOLDIER: I was ready to fight for my life, and I did, even lying there under the blazing sun. I realized I was too close to the Russians, and you even start to look at your gun in a different way.</p><p>WALSH: But the drone operators had other plans. They attached water, medicine, and a note to the drone and sent it back. It found him again and dropped the package. But he didn't know if it was friendly or a Russian bomb.</p><p>SERHIY: All the time I was crawling, a drone was always hovering above. We didn't realize if it was friend or foe. It was a lottery.</p><p>WALSH: This is the moment he realizes the drone may save him. The water and medicine kept coming, easing the pain that was visible even from up high. And then he crawled back to safety.</p><p>SERHIY: The combat medics who gave me first aid when they found me were very surprised I survived for two days with a pierced lung.</p><p>WALSH: Serhiy is recovering and talks of a new life with greater value and purpose. They don't want to leave anyone behind, said the drone operator.</p><p>Every life is important to us. I could not live with myself if we just left someone behind in the field.</p><p>Probably only several miles away, salvation was uglier. Here is a Ukrainian assault by the 15th National Guard on a Russian position. It is ferocious and eventually forced a dozen Russian troops to pull back. Artillery had injured the Russian commander badly, and the Russians left him behind, presuming he was dead. But this video supplied by Ukrainian forces shows they found him alive. He received medical treatment.</p><p>We're not naming him for his safety, but he was later awarded a posthumous medal, according to Russian media reports, left behind and declared dead by his comrades.</p><p>[03:10:03]</p><p>The Ukrainians who found him say he may have wished he didn't survive.</p><p>We said, don't try anything or you'll die, he says. And he asked us to shoot him and we offered him a chance to do it himself. But he said he could not do that. He's an enemy, and I had no real desire to save him, but orders are orders. And they have our guys, and we can swap prisoners.</p><p>As a human, another says, I was shocked that they had left him behind. But as a soldier, I know my enemy, and I know it's not an uncommon practice for them.</p><p>The opposite fate on different sides in these wide, ugly expanses of violence.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARRAK: Still ahead at this hour, uncertainty in Niger as coup leaders face a deadline to give up power. We'll discuss what's at stakes for millions of people in the country.</p><p>And massive crowds in Portugal as Pope Francis attends what's known as the catholic Woodstock. What's in store as he prepares to wrap up his five-day visit.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:15:00] HARRAK: Today is the deadline Niger's coup leaders were given to reinstate the country's ousted president. A bloc of West African nations set that deadline and has drafted a plan for potential military intervention if their demands aren't met. Neighboring Algeria, though, is rejecting such action, saying it could further destabilize the region.</p><p>CNN's Larry Madowo joins us with more. Larry, good day. And Niger's military coup leaders apparently still defiant in the face ECOWAS' deadline to restore the ousted president?</p><p>LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Laila. They insist that they will defend themselves if this group of ECOWAS countries decide to militarily intervene as they promised they would do in a week if President Mohamed Bazoum is not reinstated.</p><p>The chiefs of defense of the ECOWAS bloc met in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, for three days. They finished that up by saying they're ready, they've decided the logistics and the timing, the when, where, and how they would militarily intervene if it came to it. But that will be a last resort. They're still hoping that there's a path for dialogue.</p><p>The only support that the Nigerien military junta have is their neighbors, Burkina Faso and Mali, that are also ruled military juntas, said that any military intervention in Niger would be tantamount to an act of war against Mali and Burkina Faso and they would support them.</p><p>So, could that actually work out? Listen to President Mohamed Bazoum's prime minister, who has been speaking in Paris about that possibility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OUHOUMOUDOU MAHAMADOU, OUSTED NIGERIEN PRIME MINISTER: We don't have the Mali military on our borders, we have jihadist groups. We don't have the Burkinabe government and soldiers on our borders. We have jihadist groups. So, to get to Niger, they have to cross the jihadist groups they've spent years fighting and haven't managed to fight.</p><p>So, for us, that's an empty threat. We don't see how the Malian army or the Burkinabe army could intervene in Niger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MADOWO: So, empty threat is how the ousted government of Mohamed Bazoum considers that banding together, really, these military juntas in Mali and Burkina Faso in support of Niger, Guinea which is also ruled by military junta, has said that they support the junta and the people of Niger, so that's one side.</p><p>The real question here is would ECOWAS actually carry out this military intervention they have threatened? We are waiting to hear a statement at some point today about the next steps forward, Laila.</p><p>HARRAK: Larry, what kind of future awaits the people of Niger now facing all this uncertainty? MADOWO: There could be devastating effects if this military intervention goes ahead. Because the combination of instability and the other humanitarian factors means that the 4.4 million people that are already needing humanitarian assistance could be further affected by this. A group of 16 aid organizations have warned against that possibility and said that this is the worst thing this region needs.</p><p>Even at the best of times, Niger is only an oasis of peace in a really dangerous neighborhood. They suffer from the jihadist threat. These extremist groups that the prime minister's been talking about, they're active in Mali and Burkina Faso. But they have also been a big thorn in the flesh of the government of President Mohamed Bazoum.</p><p>Adding a military confrontation on top of the other humanitarian situations is the absolute worst combination of factors in this situation, and that the ECOWAS has talked about the possible ripple effect of any kind of prolonged conflict in Niger.</p><p>HARRAK: Larry Madowo reporting, thank you so much, Larry.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Pakistan, several supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan were arrested during a protest against his arrest.</p><p>The police also tried to disperse the crowd that had gathered in response to their leader's sentencing. Khan was arrested Saturday soon after a court sentenced him to three years in prison. He was found guilty of unlawfully selling state gifts during his time as prime minister.</p><p>In a recorded message, Khan urged his supporters to protest peacefully for their, quote, human rights.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMRAN KHAN, FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER: By the time you hear this statement, they will have arrested me. I have only one appeal. Don't sit silently at home. I am struggling for you and the country and your children's future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRAK: Well, Khan has denied all wrongdoing and says the cases against him are politically motivated.</p><p>An enormous wave of israeli protesters again swept through Tel Aviv on Saturday calling on their government to stop its contentious overhaul of the nation's judiciary.</p><p>[03:20:07]</p><p>Large demonstrations like this have taken place every weekend since January, and sometimes more often.</p><p>Journalist Elliott Gotkine was there and has our report.</p><p>ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST: Israel's parliament, the Knesset, may be on its long summer recess. We may be in the midst of summer holidays. But as you can see, there is still no letup to these protests against the government's judicial overhaul. Once again, more than eight months in, there are still tens of thousands if not more people on the streets protesting against this judicial overhaul, which these protesters say will irreparably damage Israeli democracy. And there will be no letup, they say, until the government either reaches a compromise or until it backs down.</p><p>Elliott Gotkine, CNN, Tel Aviv.</p><p>HARRAK: Just hours earlier, downtown Tel Aviv was rocked by a fatal shooting incident. Israeli police say a police officer on patrol in the financial district was shot by a Palestinian gunman. The gunman was then shot and killed by another officer. The U.S. State Department has condemned the incident as a terror attack.</p><p>The U.S. is also condemning the killing of a 19-year-old Palestinian villager on Friday by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. Two settlers were being held for questioning in that incident. The U.N. recently reported that violent clashes between settlers and Palestinians have risen sharply since the start of the year.</p><p>In the next hour, Pope Francis will deliver a farewell mass as he wraps up a five-day visit to Portugal. And as you can see here, a live look, large crowds have gathered at a riverside park in Lisbon as the pope arrives for the open-air mass. It comes a day after the pontiff prayed at a catholic shrine with some 200,000 people.</p><p>And that's where CNN's Antonia Mortensen picks up the story.</p><p>ANTONIA MORTENSEN, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Another action-packed day for Pope Francis here in Portugal for World Youth Day. On Saturday morning, Pope Francis visited the shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, Portugal's holiest site. According to the Catholic Church, in 1979, the Virgin Mary is believed to have appeared to three shepherd children in the Portuguese town of Fatima. Fatima has been historically important to all popes, given the strong references in the apparition.</p><p>The pontiff is in Portugal on a five-day trip for World Youth Day, a global gathering of catholic youth dubbed as the catholic Woodstock, and it really is, as you can see around me, where he has been received like a rock star. And this evening, massive crowds here for the vigil, while authorities estimate as many as a million people have arrived.</p><p>The 86-year-old was in good spirits, almost rejuvenated during his trip. And tonight on the Pope Mobile, he has been greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. The octogenarian has been busy over the last few days, many admiring his stamina.</p><p>His message to catholic youth has been consistent. There is room for everyone in the Catholic Church. Look after your planet and be careful of the pitfalls of social media and the internet.</p><p>Sunday is the last day of the pope's trip, and he will conclude World Youth Day with a mass before heading back to the Vatican. Antonia Mortensen, CNN, Lisbon.</p><p>HARRAK: Still to come, record-breaking heat continues to bake parts of the U.S., as more triple-digit temperatures are expected. We'll have the latest forecast.</p><p>Also ahead, Canada's historic wildfires are having an outsized impact on the indigenous population. We'll speak to the grand chief of the Cree Nation about how the destruction is hurting her community.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:25:00]</p><p>HARRAK: Welcome back to our viewers in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak and you're watch watching CNN newsroom.</p><p>Record-breaking heat is expected in the coming days from California to Florida. Heat indices could top 115 degrees in some parts and severe storms with flooding rains and damaging winds are targeting the nation's midsection.</p><p>CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar breaks it down for us.</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: More than 100 records are expected to be broken all the way through Monday of the upcoming week. And this stretches from Arizona all the way over into Florida.</p><p>Keep in mind some of these cities could end up breaking records two, if not even three days in a row. Looking at the actual temperatures for Sunday, we will top out at 107 degrees in Dallas, 105 in San Antonio, 101 in Jackson, Mississippi, even Tallahassee topping out at 97 degrees. And that doesn't even take into account the humidity that's going to be factored in.</p><p>The problem is in the long-term forecast, that heat stays in place across the southern tier of the U.S., so there's not really much relief in sight for a lot of these cities, including Phoenix, which is expected to stay well above their average of 106 for at least the next seven days.</p><p>The only cities that are likely to see some relief are the ones that are getting rain showers. And that's really going to be focused across the Midwest spreading into the mid-Atlantic region over the next 24 to 48 hours. The problem is it's not just some summer rain showers. You're also looking at the potential for some severe storms.</p><p>The main concerns for a lot of these cities are going to be damaging winds, large hail, but flooding is also a concern, especially for hard-hit states like Kentucky and Tennessee, which have seen a tremendous amount of rain just in the last 48 hours. Now, we're adding more rain on top of that. So, areas like Cincinnati, Nashville, St. Louis, even stretching down to Atlanta, all have the potential for those severe storms on Sunday. The forecast rainfall for a lot of these areas, you're mostly looking at two to four inches. But, remember, this is compounded on top of whatever any of these communities have had in the last two to three days. Now, we're going to be adding on top of that as well.</p><p>HARRAK: Our thanks to Allison Chinchar.</p><p>Well, the extraordinary heat is not just baking the northern hemisphere. A combination of human-caused climate change and the arrival of El Nino is also pushing temperatures south of the equator to record levels.</p><p>CNN's Rafael Romo has the story.</p><p>[03:30:00]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's currently winter in the southern hemisphere, and these mountains outside Santiago, the capital of Chile, are supposed to be covered in snow.</p><p>It's very hot here, the student in Santiago says. It doesn't even feel like winter. In the last few days, Temperatures in the Chilean capital reached 25 degrees Celsius when the normal is 10 degrees cooler this time of year. What used to be an anomaly, experts say, has become the new norm.</p><p>At the U.S./Mexico border, extreme heat has become another obstacle migrants face as they travel north.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's been a swell in migrants, says a young woman fainted due to the high temperatures.</p><p>ROMO: And across the borders, states like Arizona, California, Nevada have been boiling for more than a month.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Even those who deny we're in the midst of a climate crisis can't deny the impact extreme heat is having on Americans. Americans, like an elderly woman in Phoenix, who fell out of her wheelchair, and after five minutes on the ground, had third- degree burns. ROMO: The National Weather Service says this heat wave is not typical due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures, and warm nights. They also say that everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert.</p><p>CARLO BUONTEMPO, DIRECTOR, EUROPEAN COPERNICUS CLIMATE CHANGE SERVICE: In all likelihood, we have never experienced a world so hot in modern history.</p><p>ROMO: The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization recently said that July was the planet's hottest on record by far and hottest in around 120,000 years.</p><p>ANTONIO GUTIERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Climate change is here, it is terrifying and it is just the beginning. The era of global warming has ended. The era of global boiling has arrived.</p><p>ROMO: Even in places like tropical Cuba, where people are used to humidity and high temperatures, records were broken in late July when the thermometer reached 39 degrees Celsius, forcing this man without an air conditioner to improvise by filling up a bathtub and adding chunks of ice.</p><p>Resourcefulness aside, this is yet another worrisome reminder of what extreme temperatures are forcing people to do around the world.</p><p>Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARRAK: Well, more than 1,000 wildfires are burning across Canada right now. The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center says a staggering 32 million acres have burned so far this year. Experts say this year's fire season is about twice as bad as any other wildfire season on record. The fires have been particularly harmful to Canada's indigenous population.</p><p>Joining me now, Mandy Gull-Masty is a member of the Cree First Nation of Waswanapi and the first woman to be elected grant chief of the Cree Nation in Quebec. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Now, Canada, as you know better than anyone, has been struggling to subdue these ferocious fires that are burning out of control. How have these catastrophic fires impacted you personally, your community, and your land?</p><p>MANDY GULL-MASTY, GRAND CHIEF, CREE NATION QUEBEC: Hi, good evening. These fires in the Cree Nation's traditional territories have been very significant. I myself personally, I'm coming to you from a camp this evening. We wanted to come blueberry-picking. It is the summer harvest season. Unfortunately, we spent this afternoon fighting hot spots that are still burning in the territory, also managing information. Two of our northern coastal communities have been closed off once again, the main highway along the James Bay Coast is closed due to reigniting fires in the territory.</p><p>HARRAK: Now, I understand that you and your community were forced to leave. Describe that experience and the impact of these evacuations.</p><p>GULL-MASTY: The fire season in northern Quebec is something that happens every year. In the past 15 years, we have had to evacuate two communities. This summer, in a period of eight weeks, we have evacuated eight of the nine communities. In one community, they were given five hours' notice. In one other community, the fire came up to ten kilometers away. It is very difficult. Some communities were able to evacuate by vehicle, some only airlifted by air.</p><p>So, families being divided, elders leaving, we have a lot of people that speak only Cree or speak only English in the French province. It is challenging when you're being sent somewhere that you're not familiar with, a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety, a lot of difficulties for the communities to combat. HARRAK: And what do you make of the local authorities' handling of these evacuations and of these fires in general?</p><p>[03:35:00]</p><p>GULL-MASTY: It's been really hard. Because one of the compliances that the provincial government manages the fire in the northern territory, for us, we do have emergency plans. The criteria for (INAUDIBLE), the provincial department that's in charge of fires, has a set of criteria. It's protection of municipalities, infrastructure. And for us, because we are in an area where it's not heavily populated and there's not a lot of infrastructure, protecting the forest itself is not one of the endeavors that this department follows. They're there to really ensure that people are safe, infrastructure is safe, and then the rest of the territory's monitored and contained.</p><p>For us, that is a detrimental approach. We are losing forest. We've lost up to 2 million hectares of forest this year alone. It's a significant impact on our members who haven't been able to harvest, haven't been able to go to their bush camps, many people heavily impacted by the loss of multiple camps. It's going to really be challenging for us this summer. But the true impact of what we've lost is going to be apparent this fall when our members go out to harvest their fall harvests.</p><p>I do think that we need more support. I feel that there has to be an intensive reaction to fires and more of a prevention. Because once these fires have ignited, they've reached massive proportions.</p><p>HARRAK: And, of course, that's the crux of this problem. I mean, these catastrophic fires are being attributed in part to climate change. What does the reality mean for you and your community going forward? How are you preparing for the intensification of the climate crisis? What can be done?</p><p>GULL-MASTY: My nation has 11 communities, nine of them located in the USG. We have undertaken a report for climate. We have been planning for this. We really need our provincial and federal governments to partner with us in a response.</p><p>This year, it has been an unprecedented year. The traditional knowledge that we depend on in managing the territory has been really hard to implement. And we really need our partners, the other members in the territory, other governments that are reigning in this territory to work with us in collaborative effort. Everybody who resides here is impacted by fires and everybody who is a citizen on this globe is impacted by the fires.</p><p>We've seen smoke reaching New York. We've seen smoke reaching Europe. It's an example when one place is hit hard, everybody is impacted. We're also one of the largest global sinks in the world, so -- carbon sinks in the world. So, it's really hard for us to see what is happening right now, and it's going to be challenging for the Earth as a whole when you see such significant impact on the large forest scapes. HARRAK: Mandy Gull-Masty, thank you so much for sharing your experiences with us and that of your community and we wish you all safety.</p><p>GULL-MASTY: Thank you.</p><p>HARRAK: In just minutes, an update to a story we've been tracking for you on CNN. We now know who Florida police say shot two of their own and was killed after a standoff with officers.</p><p>Plus, a social media influencer facing charges of inciting a riot after he lured thousands of his followers for a free giveaway that went terribly wrong. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:40:00]</p><p>HARRAK: We now know the identity of the man accused of shooting two Florida police officers, sending authorities on an hours-long manhunt for the suspect. The Orlando Police Department said the 28-year-old suspected gunman, Dayton S. Viel, is now dead. He apparently exchanged gunfire with a SWAT Team while barricaded in a hotel yesterday morning. Well, the two officers were shot while conducting a traffic stop on Friday night for a vehicle wanted in connection with a homicide. Officials say the suspect had an extensive criminal history.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHIEF ERIC SMITH, ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT: This is a tragedy for our department any time you get officers shot. These officers are out here every day protecting the community. They put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. And for some piece of crap to do this to them because they don't want to go back to prison is ridiculous, and we're not going to put up with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRAK: Well, at last check, the two officers hurt remain in critical condition.</p><p>Social media influencer Kai Cenat has been charged with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly after he drew thousands of his followers to New York City with promises of a giveaway, including Playstations and computers. Dozens of people were arrested while many police officers were injured.</p><p>CNN's Polo Sandoval has the details.</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: New York City officials investigating Friday's incident after an unlawful assembly here in the heart of Manhattan quickly spiraled into an out-of-control mob as initially the NYPD says hundreds of young people, which later turned out to be thousands of them, were drawn here by a popular social media influencer with promises of free video games and other free items. Over the weekend, though, the cleanup does continue with power washing crews trying to remove some of the paint splatter. You see that mob tore down that temporary fencing at a construction site, some of the materials, some of the equipment at the site used during the incident.</p><p>We understand three officers and four civilians were hurt. About half of the roughly 65 people who were arrested are juveniles.</p><p>On Saturday, we heard from Mayor Eric Adams as he offered information on what may have led to Friday's incident and also addressed the police response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY, NY): We believe there was some outside influences that may have attempted to aggravate the situation. And I cannot say enough for the police department yesterday. I don't think people realize the level of discipline that was shown to take a very dangerous, volatile situation and to be able to bring it to a level of resolve without any loss of life, any substantial damage to property, and without young people harming themselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDOVAL: As for the social media influencer at the center of it all, he's expected to return to court on August 18th after being charged with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly.</p><p>Polo Sandoval, CNN, New York.</p><p>HARRAK: The White House says it's time for more federal employees to edge away from the work from home. It's asking cabinet agencies to bring workers back to the office more frequently.</p><p>CNN White House Reporter Kevin Liptak has more.</p><p>[03:45:00]</p><p>KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: The White House is making a major new push to get federal workers back into the office now that the national COVID emergency has ended. The White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, saying in an email obtained by CNN and sent to the heads of cabinet agencies that this is a priority of President Biden's, to get federal workers back into the office. He says that it will increase productivity, but he also cites the importance of these face-to-face interactions in developing younger federal workers.</p><p>Now, the White House had been coming under pressure both from Republicans but also from the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, who had voiced increasing concern about the number of vacant office spaces in her city.</p><p>Now, of course, this is an issue that has been going on in workplaces across the country, and the federal government is no different. Some workplaces have struggled to convince workers to come back into the office after they had structured their whole lives around working from home. But President Biden says that this is a priority, and in that email, Jeff Zients directs cabinet heads and agencies and departments to work and aggressively execute this shift over the coming months.</p><p>Now, Jeff Zients doesn't say that work from home will be eliminated entirely. Instead, he says he wants to work to develop a solution while ensuring we have the in-person time we need to build a strong culture, trust and interpersonal connections.</p><p>Kevin Liptak, CNN, in Wilmington, Delaware.</p><p>HARRAK: Wells Fargo says its disappearing deposit glitch has been resolved. The banking giant says all accounts are now showing accurate balances and transactions. The issue began on Thursday when some customers complained on social media they could not access money they had deposited. A person familiar with the matter tells CNN the problem was caused by an isolated technical glitch and was not related to a cybersecurity incident.</p><p>The Biden administration says it's taking a digital first approach to stopping the spread of fentanyl in the U.S., at the center of the search, tracing cryptocurrency payments between some of the most dangerous Mexican drug cartels and Chinese chemical companies. The use of digital currency has exploded among fentanyl traffickers.</p><p>And CNN Cybersecurity Reporter Sean Lyngaas explains.</p><p>SEAN LYNGAAS, CNN CYBERSECURITY REPORTER: The drug war has gone virtual. Mexican cartels are increasingly using cryptocurrency to pay for fentanyl ingredients and smuggle them into the U.S. as part of the deadly drug trade.</p><p>How is the Biden administration responding? There's an ongoing surge involving multiple agencies where they're furiously trying to trace the source of this funding and intercept the funds where they can. The DEA told CNN it has identified senior money launderers within the cartels who specialize in cryptocurrency.</p><p>The IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, for its part, has some of its best agents trying to infiltrate dark web forums where the drugs are bought. It's very much an ongoing process, and progress couldn't come soon enough as tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdoses every year, much of it from fentanyl.</p><p>I'm Sean Lyngaas in Washington.</p><p>HARRAK: A six-year-old boy in Florida was hospitalized with traumatic injuries after an apparent fall from a roller coaster. It happened Thursday at the Fun Spot America Theme Park south of Orlando. Police say they found the boy under the Galaxy Spin roller coaster. The ride's track was about 20 feet above where the child was located. The roller coaster is closed while authorities investigate.</p><p>The most-decorated U.S. gymnast ever stormed back with a vengeance. Ahead, Simone Biles made it look so easy in her return to competitive gymnastics.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[03:50:00]</p><p>HARRAK: After two years away, seven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles triumphantly returned to competition on Saturday. And just like that, she won.</p><p>At the Core Hydration Classic outside Chicago, the 26-year-old U.S. star won the all-around, the floor routine, and the balance beam, and placed third on the uneven bars as the sell-out crowd cheered her on.</p><p>CNN's Isabel Rosales reports.</p><p>ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're just under one year away from the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Time flies here, and seven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles is back. The excitement not just from the fans but from fellow athletes is tangible here at now arena. I've certainly heard little girls screaming all day long here, just waiting, waiting on Simone. And folks are so excited, in fact, that they sold out every single seat, 7,200 of them, all of them here to witness the greatest of all-time back in action.</p><p>And this meet is so important because it is the last chance to qualify for the U.S. Nationals in San Jose and then later on in the fall for the world championships, and all that leading, of course, to the Olympics. Biles has been registered for all four events, and people keeping a close eye on how she does after this two-year hiatus.</p><p>And that's the last time we saw Simone Biles compete was in Tokyo, where she shocked the world by withdrawing from all of her events after suffering from the twisties. That's a spatial and mental block that gymnasts can suffer from where they can't tell what's up and what's down when they're flipping in midair, so certainly problematic for an elite gymnast.</p><p>She, after Tokyo, after the Tokyo games, disappeared from competitive gymnastics. Now, so many people are excited to see her back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSALES: And what does your shirt say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Simone Freaking Biles.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The courage and be a role model to come and say, no, my mental health is more important, my physical health is more important because the twisties, she could have gotten paralyzed, let's be honest. I was so proud of her.</p><p>ROSALES: When you heard Simone was coming back to the world of gymnastics, oh my gosh, what did you think?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We heard Simone was coming back, she started going crazy. She was like, mom, please get tickets, please, please, please get tickets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSALES: And CNN spoke with Joan Ryan. She is author and also a sports analyst. And she says that Simone competing again is proof that there's a positive change in the world of gymnastics, that this whole idea that you have to be a prepubescent teen to succeed at this level, that is just not reality. Biles, 26 years old, recently married, and now getting back on the mat again.</p><p>Isabel Rosales, CNN, Hoffman Estates, Illinois.</p><p>HARRAK: The Netherlands, they are once again advancing to the quarterfinals of the women's World Cup. The 2019 finalists have ended South Africa's remarkable tournament run with a 2-0 victory. The 54th ranked African champions put up a fight in their first knockout stage appearance, but they couldn't find the net all match. And with that, the Dutch will move on to the next round where they'll face Spain in a heavyweight clash.</p><p>And we're wrapping things up this hour with a whole lot of pink, a touch of Barbie, and a full-on display of Caribbean culture. Revelers flooded the streets of Toronto Saturday for the annual grant parade, part of a festival honoring Caribbean culture, which lasts for several days. And this year the dancers wore costumes inspired by, among other things, the movies Barbie and Avatar. The cultural celebration first got started in 1967. Terrific.</p><p>I'm Laila Harrak.

So, they`ll cut a Christmas tree in an area that we haven`t treated yet.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: After being a dude ranch, then a marijuana B&amp;B, came bankruptcy.</p><p>Philip Savier (ph) took over and is working with the Colorado State Forest Service on a three-year plan, going from this to this, spacing the trees and clearing the underbrush to prevent this.</p><p>PHILIP SAVIER: If there were 100 trees, there might be 15 left, and they now have space between them and they can grow, they can get water. And so, the idea is instead of having a forest fire, you create this environment where there`s room between the trees. And it turns into a healthy forest again.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: When he is done, he will sell the ranch to Project Sanctuary, a group that brings military families together in a wilderness setting to reconnect after long deployments.</p><p>PHILIP SAVIER: There`s going to be hundreds of people affected positively, because of this experience. The family fishing on the river, hanging out, hiking. We have beautiful lakes.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And will help heal.</p><p>PHILIP SAVIER: It will, it will. There will be hundreds if not thousands of people affected by this opportunity to come out here and hang out.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: Meanwhile, the Mosleys` tree has gone from its forest home to their home, where grandson three-year-old Monte is a forest firefighting tree trimmer in the making.</p><p>What do you want for Christmas?</p><p>MONTE (Three-Year-Old): A chainsaw.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: What do you do with a chainsaw?</p><p>MONTE: Cut down trees.</p><p>BARRY PETERSEN: And with more trees cut down, the better chance the rest will survive and just maybe become next year`s point of Christmas joy.</p><p>Barry Petersen, CBS News, in the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JERICKA DUNCAN: So many positive connections there.</p><p>Still ahead on the CBS WEEKEND NEWS, remembering Kangol Kid, a hip hop pioneer who spent his final chapter raising awareness of the disease that claimed his life.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>JERICKA DUNCAN: New Jersey`s attorney general`s office is investigating a fatal police shooting after an unidentified man went on a rampage with a backhoe.

In much of the region, plants that fuel fires are also the driest scientists have seen. The vegetation is primed to ignite, especially in the Southwest where <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/prescott/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD904406\">dead juniper trees</url> are full of flammable needles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt\u2019s like having gasoline out there,\u201d said Brian Steinhardt, forest fire zone manager for Prescott and Coconino national forests in Arizona.</p><p>A climate change-fueled megadrought of more than 20 years is making conditions that lead to fire even more dangerous, scientists said. Rainfall in the Rockies and farther west was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/regional/time-series/120/pcp/1/4/1895-2021?base_prd=true&amp;begbaseyear=1901&amp;endbaseyear=2000\">second lowest</url> on record in April, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>\u201cIt means that the dice are loaded toward a lot of forest fire this year,\u201d said Park Williams, a UCLA climate and fire scientist, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/peedublya/status/1391860524388806656\">calculated that soil</url> in the western half of the nation is the driest it has been since 1895. \u201cThis summer we\u2019re going into fire season with drier fuels than we were at this time last year.\u201d</p><p>In addition, the western drought is deepening week by week.</p><p> In late March, less than one-third of California was suffering extreme or exceptional drought. Now more than 73% is, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx\">National Drought Monitor</url>, which is based on precipitation, temperature, soil moisture and streamflow measurements. A year ago, heading into the record-smashing 2020 fire year when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/\">more than 4% of California burned</url>, just 3% of the state was in extreme or exceptional drought.</p><p>But the outlook is worse elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cI think the Southwest is really primed for a bad fire season,\u201d University of Utah fire scientist Phil Dennison said. That\u2019s because last year\u2019s normal monsoon season, which brings much of the year\u2019s rainfall, never showed up.</p><p>A year ago, none of Arizona, Nevada and Utah was in extreme or exceptional drought, but now more than 90% of Utah, 86% of Arizona and 75% of Nevada is in those highest drought categories, according to the drought monitor. New Mexico jumped from 4% extreme or exceptional drought a year ago to more than 77% now.</p><p>UCLA meteorologist Daniel Swain, who also works for the National Center for Atmospheric Research and The Nature Conservancy, said key factors going into fire season are soil and plant wetness.</p><p>\u201cSo is soil moisture very low? Is vegetation extremely dry? Absolutely, yes. Unequivocally, yes. Pretty much everywhere in California and the Southwest,\" Swain said. \u201cSo that box is checked big time in a way that is going to massively increase the potential background flammability ... given a spark, given extreme weather conditions.\u201d</p><p>This doesn\u2019t necessarily ensure the 2021 fire season will be worse than 2020. Last year more than 15,800 square miles (40,960 square kilometers) of the United States burned, an area about the size of Maryland and Delaware combined. Several scientists said last year\u2019s fires were stoked not just by hot, dry conditions, but by unusual situations that made a bad year horrific:</p><p>Two intense heat waves \u2014 one that nearly set a record for hottest temperature on Earth in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-featured-weather-california-3bca83b93a5b3fd967fd97a65a8de2cb\">Death Valley</url> \u2014 set the stage, and a freak California lightning barrage provided lots of spark.</p><p>The lightning outbreak was the type that has happened only a few times in history and is unlikely to occur two years in a row, Swain said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be the hottest summer,\" he said, adding. \u201cI\u2019m really grasping at straws here. All we have going for us is dumb luck.\u201d</p><p>When the scientists see extremely dry or dying trees, they get even more worried.</p><p>In Arizona, junipers are succumbing to the 20-year drought and its two-year intensification, said Joel McMillin, a forest health zone leader for the U.S. Forest Service there. Officials haven\u2019t done a precise count but anecdotally the die-off is 5% to 30% with some patches up to 60%.</p><p>Until the dead needles drop to the ground, which takes a year or so, the fire hazard increases, fire manager Steinhardt said. \u201cSo you have something that\u2019s highly flammable and it\u2019s ... 20-, 30-, 40-foot tall and every single one of those needles on there now becomes an ember that can be launched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably one of the driest and potentially most challenging situations I\u2019ve been in,\u201d said the veteran of 32 fire seasons.</p><p>In California, normally drought-tolerant blue oaks are dying around the San Francisco Bay Area, said Scott Stephens, a fire science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to water. Soil moisture is so low. When you start to see blue oak dying, that gets your attention.\u201d</p><p>Human-caused climate change and decades of fire suppression that increases fuel loads are aggravating fire conditions across the West, scientists said.</p><p>Global warming has contributed to the megadrought and is making plants more prone to burning.</p><p>Normally a good part of the sun\u2019s energy removes water from plants and soil, but when they are already dry, that energy instead makes the air hotter, which creates a feedback loop, Swain said.</p><p>And drier conditions lead to beetle infestations that further weaken and kill trees, said University of Utah's Dennison.</p><p>For decades, U.S. firefighting agencies have tried to put out fires as quickly as possible, and that's usually worked, UCLA's Williams said. But the practice resulted in the buildup of dense trees, brush and other potential fire fuels.</p><p>\u201cFire is escaping our control increasingly frequently,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of the reason for that might be because of increasing density of fuels. But we also see that these fires are escaping our control during record-breaking heat waves \u2014 and it\u2019s the warmest, driest years when we have the hardest time controlling fires.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Read stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate\">https://apnews.com/hub/climate</url></p><p>___</p><p>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/borenbears\">@borenbears</url>.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Firefighters responded in minutes, but the fire spread through the state forest in Burlington County and into Little Egg Harbor Township in Ocean County.</p><p>Fire officials have dubbed it the Ballanger fire, named after Ballanger Creek, a small tributary of the Mullica River where it was first spotted. The fire burned into Monday, until it was fully contained. Officials attributed the spread not only to dry conditions, but also to trees that were defoliated by gypsy moths, which allowed the fire to burn more easily than if the trees were leaf-covered.</p><p>The Ballanger fire initially threatened about 100 structures, but firefighters were able to use prescribed burns to control the fire. However, officials expect smoke to be visible for possibly days as the fire smolders. No one was injured in the fire.</p><p>The second fire broke out 8:30 p.m. Monday about 25 miles away at Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, deep in the heart of the Pine Barrens. It has been dubbed the Turkey Buzzard fire after a nearby road.</p><p>Officials said the fire encompassed about 407 acres and was about 50% contained as of Tuesday morning.

Firefighters responded in minutes, but the fire spread through the state forest in Burlington County and into Little Egg Harbor Township in Ocean County.</p><p>Fire officials have dubbed it the Ballanger fire, named after Ballanger Creek, a small tributary of the Mullica River where it was first spotted. The fire burned into Monday, until it was fully contained. Officials attributed the spread not only to dry conditions, but also to trees that were defoliated by gypsy moths, which allowed the fire to burn more easily than if the trees were leafcovered.</p><p>The Ballanger fire initially threatened about 100 structures, but firefighters were able to use prescribed burns to control the fire. However, officials expect smoke to be visible for possibly days as the fire smolders. No one was injured in the fire.</p><p>The second fire broke out 8:30 p.m. Monday about 25 miles away at Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, deep in the heart of the Pine Barrens. It has been dubbed the Turkey Buzzard fire after a nearby road.</p><p>Officials said the fire encompassed about 407 acres and was about 50% contained as of Tuesday morning. It forced the closure of part of the Batona Trail from Magnolia Road to Four Mile Road.</p><p>Firefighters were still on the scene Tuesday afternoon; no one has been injured in that fire.</p><p>Ray Bukowski, an assistant commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said the fires had limited ecological impact on the fabled Pine Barrens because there was a lot of fuel in the form of downed or dead vegetation that burned.</p><p>Fire is part of the Pine Barrens ecosystem.

More fire engines, personnel and other equipment are on the way, officials said at an online news conference Monday night.</p><p>The Southwest Type 2 Incident Management Team took over operations Monday from the Type 3 Team, which handled the initial response.</p><p>A Type 2 Team brings additional resources and capabilities in fighting a more protracted wildfire.</p><p>In Valencia County, authorities called for evacuations of communities on both sides of the Rio Grande in response to a wildfire that started Monday in the bosque.</p><p>\"It is a rapidly moving fire due to the winds,\" said Matt Propp, the county fire chief.</p><p>Residents were directed to a shelter at a community center in Belen, just south of Albuquerque.</p><p>An unknown number of structures were reported as lost, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they were homes, barns or other outbuildings.</p><p>The fire's cause and the number of acres burned so far is unknown, Propp said.</p><p>In Roswell, the 1,900-acre Overflow Fire was 80 percent contained Monday.</p><p>The Bureau of Land Management was conducting a prescribed burn Thursday when extreme heat caused a \"fire whirl\" or vortex that carried embers across the planned boundaries, igniting dry grasses, agency spokeswoman Jill Aragon said.</p><p>Flames spread onto private and state lands, burning through grassy areas along the Pecos River, Aragon said.</p><p>\"They're dry; they're overgrown,\" Aragon said. \"Which is why we attempted to do a prescribed burn.\"</p><p>High winds make suppressing a wildfire more a challenge, but so far the teams have kept the flames from spreading further, Aragon said.</p><p>Three fire engines and two Hotshot crews are on the scene, along with bulldozers digging fire breaks around the lines, she said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 3,030-acre Collins Fire in the Gila National Forest was fully contained Monday.</p><p>The fire's cause is unknown, other than a human is behind it in some way, Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell said, adding lightning tends to be the main natural cause of a forest fire.</p><p>\"There wasn't any lightning in the area, so it kind of narrows it down,\" Mitchell said.</p><p>Strong winds are forecasted to blow through the region all week, with a slight letup on Wednesday. But even then they'll pose hazards for ongoing fires, said Bryan Guyer, National Weather Service meteorologist in Albuquerque.</p><p>\"This is typically the windy time of year,\" Guyer said.</p><p>Still, Tuesday's forecasted winds will be unusually fierce, even for New Mexico. Peak gusts are expected to reach</p><p>57 mph near Las Vegas, 45 in Albuquerque and 60 in Raton, making those areas and many others vulnerable.</p><p>The low humidity is exacerbating the dry conditions created by the years-long drought and the La Ni\u00f1a, Guyer said, referring to the Pacific Ocean event that pushes precipitation northward, making the Southwest more arid than normal.</p><p>All of that makes the debris and vegetation, known as fuels, more flammable, Guyer said.</p><p>In a phone interview, Overton said last summer monsoons quelled what could have been a severe and extended wildfire season. But the rains also thickened grass and vegetation, which dried out over the La Nina winter, turning into wildfire fuel that is now causing this wildfire season's early start, she said.</p><p>The best scenario is to have summer rainstorms and hope for a reasonably wet winter, Overton said, adding with climate change you can never count on that.</p><p>Associated Press contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15661756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:656V-SC61-DY7H-R52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"892\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 12, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

However, a recent spike in drug-related fatalities has many searching for the cause. The pandemic clearly had an impact on many addicts. Isolated, anxious, and stressed, countless individuals turned back to old habits over the course of the last year. But some are wondering if the ongoing overdose woes \u2014 and fentanyl overdoses, in particular \u2014 may have more to do with the ingredients than use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least, that's what CEO Bryan Alzate is postulating. The co-founder of the luxury rehab enterprise United Recovery Project (URP) and host of the podcastHell Has an Exit\u00a0has 13 years in recovery himself and is all too aware of how drug addiction works, historically speaking.</p><p>This has led Alzate to wonder what is causing a recent uptick in opioid fatalities. As reported by the CDC (via NPR), synthetic opioid fatalities rose \"by an unprecedented 55% during the twelve months ending in September 2020.\"</p><p>Alzate has followed the bread crumbs and pieced together what he believes is the reason for the sudden crisis: drugs laced with the synthetic fentanyl. Alzate explains, \"The days of doing opiates for 20 years are over. There aren't any more old heroin addicts like there were in the 70s. People are trying opiates and now they are dead within three years unless they get clean. Fentanyl has shorted the life expectancy of an entire generation.\"</p><p>Alzate goes further to connect this synthetic lacing with the supply chain woes that the country is currently facing. Just like legal importers and exporters, drug dealers are struggling to bring real heroin or drugs in their pure form. Rather than close up shop, they turn to synthetics.</p><p>This means anyone who seeks out heroin may not realize that what they're actually getting is the much stronger synthetic, fentanyl. In heroin-sized doses, this can lead to overdosing and death.</p><p>While drug addiction will always be something that humans struggle with, the current crisis is unique and demands attention. From ongoing stressors to dangerous synthetics, the risks associated with managing a drug addiction have never been higher.</p><p>Alzate's company, United Recovery Project, offers a luxury recovery environment that has been an effective way to find help for anyone struggling with fentanyl detox as well as opioid, heroin, alcohol, or other substance abuse-related issues. A low client-to-staff ratio ensures that URP can deliver customized and comprehensive care to anyone struggling with a substance abuse disorder.</p><p>Alzate\u00a0continues to be personally involved in the project, as well. \"My job,\" says the co-founder, \"is to spark the flame in the addict who doesn't think he can. That's what I focus on. Little Sparks all over the world. Not trying to put out a forest fire. I'm focused on starting my own fire.\"</p><p>URP has already made its mark on countless lives in the past. With the building synthetic opioid crisis, it appears that its services may be more in demand than ever before going forward.</p><p>About United Recovery Project: URP was founded in 2016 in Hollywood, Florida. The addiction treatment program prides itself on offering an all-inclusive selection of programs that can be tailored to each client's needs. URP is in the process of expanding to other states as well, where it hopes to offer ongoing substance abuse help to those who need it as well as their loved ones.

Resources will continue to patrol and monitor the area.</p><p>Prairie City Ranger District successfully completed approximately 970 acres of prescribed landscape burning in the Elk 16 FA unit this week. Resources will continue to patrol and monitor the area.</p><p>All 3 districts may begin burning piles on November 9. All burning is weather and condition dependent.</p><p>For the safety of firefighters and the public, roads and areas of prescribed fire activity will be signed. Please avoid these areas so as not to interfere with ongoing operations. For safety, roads, trails, and areas may need to close temporarily as firefighter operations are taking place. Although unlikely, smoky conditions may also reduce visibility to a level that would require additional temporary closures. During prescribed fire operations, there is potential for impacts to camping and hunting. Hunters are advised to plan ahead. For their safety they should not camp in or near an area of prescribed fire activity. Until we receive additional precipitation on the burns, forest visitors can expect to see smoke in vicinity of the burn units. Logs and larger fuels will continue to smolder until that precipitation occurs.</p><p>The public can monitor smoke and air quality in our area and across the state by visiting, <url normalizedValue=\"http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/\">http://oregonsmoke.blogspot.com/</url>.

Mike Armstrong, R-12th District, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Legislation introduced in Olympia at the request of Gov. Jay Inslee poses an enormous threat to those involved in agriculture, says Rep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Bill 1838 received a public hearing recently in the House Rural Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources (RDAN) Committee. It would mandate riparian buffers as wide as 250 feet in some areas for salmon habitat. Landowners would have to pay up to 30% of the cost of planting trees and other mitigation actions, and could be fined $10,000 per day for noncompliance.</p><p>After two days of public testimony, Kretz, who is a long-time member of the committee, said he feared for the future of farming in Washington state.</p><p>\"This is one of the worst bills I've seen in my time serving in the state House of Representatives,\" said Kretz, who is currently serving his 9th two-year term in the Legislature. \"This proposal mandates riparian buffers that would devastate family farms, orchards, cattle and ranching operations, dairy farms, and even small forest landowners. It's an unrealistic expectation that places fish habitat above the needs and realities of the agriculture families that feed our state and nation. I've talked to several local farmers and ranchers who have looked at their own land and said this would put them out of business the day it becomes law.\"</p><p>Kretz also expressed his frustration that little-to-no cooperation was attempted outside of the governor's office, calling it the 'ultimate silo bill.'</p><p>\"This is not how you pass legislation in Olympia,\" said Kretz. \"The agriculture industry in our state feeds millions, employs thousands, and has long been on the cutting edge of true conservation. But no one outside the governor's office - no stakeholders - were really brought to the table to talk about these issues to come up with workable solutions. The bill was drafted in a silo of information representing one extreme idea - that salmon habitat is the most important piece of this puzzle and damn everyone else.\"</p><p>Kretz doesn't know if the bill will move beyond the House committee during this short, 60-day remote session, but stressed he's working with legislators on both sides of the aisle to kill the bill. Instead, he'd like to bring a variety of interests and expertise together to find solutions that can make a difference without destroying agriculture families in the process.</p><p>\"I think there are workable solutions to pretty much any problem as long as you can get the right people in the room and have honest, open debate,\" said Kretz, who has worked across the aisle successfully in the past on forest fire prevention and forest health legislation. \"I think the drafters of this bill focused on a few bad apples and then applied their version of a solution across the entire state. That's not the right approach. They're ignoring, whether purposefully or through ignorance, the good work that landowners have done over the last few decades to improve their land and help fish habitat. We need to bring all those efforts to the table, share them, and find ways to incentivize and encourage these actions over time, rather than put a gun to the head of the Ag industry.\"</p><p>Kretz said he's heard from several tribes that no longer support the bill in its current form and said they could be a huge ally in finding solutions that work.</p><p>\"We have worked with our local tribes on a number of issues, from accessing credit for small businesses to working on healthy forests, to responding to local wildfires,\" said Kretz. \"The agriculture industry and the tribes have a lot in common, in terms of the things that are important to them: sustainability, family legacies, feeding communities, and opportunities for economic freedom and food security. I can see our local tribes being part of the solution as we work to counter what the governor has put on the table.\"</p><p>Kretz said concerned citizens can contact the chair of the RDAN committee, Rep. Mike Chapman, at (564) 888-2321, to request he kill the bill.</p><p>The 60-day remote 2022 legislative session began Jan. 10.

'But actually the drought builds up across the year.' <br/>Climate change has lessened temperature differences between regions, sapping the forces that drive the jet stream, which normally brings wet Atlantic weather to Europe, he said. <br/>A weaker or unstable jet stream can bring unusually hot air to Europe from North Africa, leading to prolonged periods of heat. The reverse is also true when a polar vortex of cold air from the Arctic can cause freezing conditions far south of where it would normally reach. <br/>Hoffmann said observations in recent years have all been at the upper end of what existing climate models predicted. <br/>Italy<br/>The parched condition of the Po, Italy's longest river, has already caused billions of euros in losses to farmers who normally rely on it to irrigate fields and rice paddies. <br/>To compensate, authorities allowed more water from Lake Garda to flow out to local rivers - 70 cubic metres (2,472 cubic feet) of water per second. But in late July, they reduced the amount to protect the lake and the financially important tourism tied to it. <br/>With 45 cubic metres (1,589 cubic feet) of water per second being diverted from Garda to rivers, the lake on Friday was just 32cm (12.6 inches) above the water table, near the record lows registered in 2003 and 2007. <br/>The lake's temperature, meanwhile, has been above average for August, according to seatemperature.org. On Friday, the Garda's water was nearly 26 degrees Celsius (78 degrees Fahrenheit), several degrees warmer than the average August temperature of 22C (71.6F) and nearing the Caribbean Sea's average of about 27C (80F). <br/>France<br/>France has also been hit this summer by a historic drought that has forced water use restrictions nationwide, as well as a series of heatwaves that experts say are being driven by climate change. <br/>Fires in France in 2022 have ravaged an area three times the annual average over the past 10 years, with blazes active in the Alpine Jura, Isere and Ardeche regions this week. <br/>European Copernicus satellite data showed more carbon dioxide greenhouse gas - over 1 million tonnes - had been released from 2022's forest fires in France. This is more than in any summer since records began in 2003. <br/>French firefighters are keeping a wary eye on a huge blaze that appeared to be contained in the country's southwest Bordeaux region[3] on Saturday, with thunderstorms and strong wind gusts expected in the area. <br/>The 40km (25-mile) fire front in the Gironde and Landes departments around Bordeaux 'did not significantly progress overnight. Firefighters are working on its periphery,' police said in a statement. <br/>But officials said it was premature to say that the blaze - which has already reignited once - was under control. <br/>'We remain vigilant' because 'while we can't see huge flames, the fire continues to consume vegetation and soil', Arnaud Mendousse, lieutenant colonel of Gironde fire and rescue, told the AFP news agency. <br/>The blaze near Bordeaux erupted in July - the driest month seen in France since 1961 - destroying 14,000 hectares (34,600 acres) and forcing thousands of people to evacuate before it was contained. <br/>But the fire has continued to smoulder in the tinder-dry pine forests and peat-rich soil. <br/>Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Gironde, said the challenge faced by emergency workers is the reoccurrence of fires that they have already extinguished due to high temperatures and extremely dry conditions. <br/>'One of the challenges for them is because the temperatures are so high, and the ground is so dry, as soon as the water hits the ground it evaporates. So it takes a lot more water and a lot more effort to put out the flames.' <br/>Portugal<br/>Portugal's civil protection agency on Saturday said it had brought a wildfire which has ravaged 17,000 hectares[4] (42,000 acres) under control in the UNESCO-designated Serra da Estrela natural park. <br/>The fire had been raging in the park for a week and was contained overnight, civil protection agency official Miguel Criz told TSF radio. <br/>'There is still a lot of work left' to prevent new fires, he said, adding that strong winds on Saturday were a cause of concern for firefighters. <br/>Portugal's Interior Minister Jose Luis Carneiro termed the fire an 'environmental tragedy'. <br/>Portugal recorded its hottest July in nearly a century and wildfires this year have ravaged some 79,000 hectares (195,200 acres). <br/>Germany<br/>In the German capital, Berlin, firefighters were called out to a forest fire in the forested area of the city called Grunewald. About 4,000 square metres of forest floor had burned, a fire brigade spokesperson said on Saturday morning, explaining that the forest floor was so dry it was not easy to extinguish the fire, requiring firefighters to dig up the embers with tools. <br/>Water levels in Germany's Rhine River also continue to dwindle, as authorities reported a drop of about 6cm (2.4 inches) over the past 24 hours on Saturday. <br/>According to the GDWS, a body responsible for waterways and shipping, the water level at Kaub in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, an important marker for shipping, now stands at 36cm (14.2 inches), with the authority predicting that it could fall to 30cm (11.8 inches) by Monday. <br/>Freight and passenger ships have been struggling with low water levels in the Rhine for several weeks. <br/>United Kingdom <br/>In the UK, the heatwave is also hitting hard, with the government formally declaring parts of southern, central and eastern England in drought after a prolonged period of hot and dry weather. <br/>England has suffered its driest July since 1935, with only 35 percent of the average rainfall for the month, and parts of England and Wales are now under an 'extreme heat' alert. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/5/italy-declares-drought-emergency\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/5/italy-declares-drought-emergency</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/12/drought-in-england-fires-rage-in-france-as-heatwave-persists\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/12/drought-in-england-fires-rage-in-france-as-heatwave-persists</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/10/thousands-evacuated-from-frances-gironde-as-forest-fires-rage\">https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/10/thousands-evacuated-from-frances-gironde-as-forest-fires-rage</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/7/11/photos-portugal-battles-wildfires-amid-drought\">https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/7/11/photos-portugal-battles-wildfires-amid-drought</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ALJZ136341166039353017925976100115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALJZ-136341</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6650-F161-JCMN-Y50J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1279\"/><timeReceived>12:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Al Jazeera English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 13, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/>Decades of warnings <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/military-pfas.png\">http://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/military-pfas.png</url> Military installations conducting assessments for PFAS use or potential release (Source. U.S. Department of Defense). <br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011, the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/>Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The manufactured chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/>Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/donate\">https://missouriindependent.com/donate</url><br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/>'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/>Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe\">https://missouriindependent.com/subscribe</url><br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[9]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/>Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[13]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[14]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[15]andMinnesota[16]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://missouriindependent.com/donate\">https://missouriindependent.com/donate</url><br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[17]andSenate[18]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ernst-screen-shot-teletown-hall-screen-shot.jpg\">https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ernst-screen-shot-teletown-hall-screen-shot.jpg</url> Sen. Joni Ernst speaks during a video her office produced about her tele-town hall on May 20, 2020. (Screen shot from Ernst video) <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011, the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The manufactured chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png\">https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png</url> Military installations conducting assessments for PFAS use or potential release. (Source. U.S. Department of Defense) <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[9]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[13]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[14]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[15]andMinnesota[16]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[17]andSenate[18]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[9]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[13]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[14]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[15]andMinnesota[16]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[17]andSenate[18]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/> (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Defense) Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

Activists are pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower, and anything less could disappoint them.</p><p>\"President Biden, canceling $10,000 in student debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement.</p><p>The announcement about Corinthian, which operated from 1995 to 2015, seeks to close the books on one of the most notorious cases of fraud in American higher education. At its peak, Corinthian was one of the largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100 campuses and more than 110,000 students at its Everest, WyoTech and Heald schools.</p><p>When Harris was California's attorney general, she worked with the Obama administration to uncover how campuses were falsifying data on the success of their graduates. In some cases, schools reported that students had found jobs in their fields of study even though they were working at grocery stores or fast food chains.</p><p>Students told investigators they were often pressured to enroll with promises of lucrative employment, only to end up with huge sums of debt and few job prospects. Federal officials found that the company falsely told students their course credits could be transferred to other colleges.</p><p>Harris said Corinthian tried to attract students who were single parents or unemployed and looking to improve their lives.</p><p>\"The company believed they could get away with it because, as predators are wont to do, they targeted people who they assumed wouldn't fight back,\" she said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of former Corinthian students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but they had to file paperwork and navigate an application process that advocates say is confusing. Now, the relief will be made automatic and extended to additional borrowers.</p><p>Those with a remaining balance on their Corinthian debt will also get refunds on payments already made, department officials said. But the action does not apply to loans paid in full. A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to a question about why that decision was made.</p><p>The Corinthian scandal led to a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges, and the Obama administration promised to forgive loans for Corinthian students whose programs lied about job placement rates. That administration went on to expand a process known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows any defrauded student to apply for debt cancellation.</p><p>The Trump administration drew criticism when it started granting only partial loan cancellation to defrauded students, giving lower levels of relief to those with higher incomes. Former Corinthian students sued, and a federal judge halted the policy and ordered the Education Department to stop collecting payments on Corinthian debt.</p><p>The Biden administration later announced full cancellation for all Corinthian students who had been given only partial forgiveness, but thousands of others were left waiting for the department to process their relief applications.</p><p>As of December, the department reported it had more than 109,000 pending applications from students alleging fraud by their colleges, mostly in the for-profit industry.</p><p>Libby DeBlasio Webster, senior counsel for the advocacy group Student Defense, called it a \"fresh start\" for former Corinthian students, but she noted that many defrauded students from other for-profit colleges are awaiting help.</p><p>She said she hopes the news \"is a sign that other decisions are on the horizon for thousands of similarly situated students who are waiting for this kind of relief.\"</p><p>Former Corinthian student Nathan Hornes had his debt forgiven in 2017 through the borrower defense process, but his sister Natasha is among the 560,000 former Corinthian students now getting cancellation.</p><p>\"My sister and all the others who went through the same experience of being cheated by Corinthian finally get to experience the same relief of having the financial burden lifted,\" he said in a statement. \"They deserve that too, and I'm so glad that today they finally get to feel that freedom.\"</p><p>A for-profit college trade group said students who are deceived by their colleges deserve relief, but that Corinthian's actions \"do not represent all private career schools.\"</p><p>\"The (Education) Department and others should not conflate the actions of one organization with an entire sector that has provided opportunities for millions of students and contributed to our nation's workforce,\" said Jason Altmire, president and CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-4914147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65KY-PY51-JCDM-J1YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Woodward Communications, Inc.

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrific fire aboard the USS Forrestal [2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identified more than 700 installations[3] where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/subscribe\">https://lailluminator.com/subscribe</url> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kidd told[4] the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.'  <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector general report[5] on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png\">https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png</url><br/> Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment.  <br/><br/> Need to get in touch? Have a news tip?  <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDC to begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including in Berkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>The report[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST. <br/><br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/donate\">https://lailluminator.com/donate</url> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Department report[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according to a report [8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' said Melanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/> Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on its webpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagency report[9] mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14 proposed new standards[10] for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and the target of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11] in government subsidies and research grants. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firefighting-foam.png\">https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/firefighting-foam.png</url> Canva image Alternative firefighting foam <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon released new requirements[12] for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020 report[13] from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states have passed or proposed prohibitions[14] on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in the Alaska[15] and Minnesota[16] state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to the House[17] and Senate[18] reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, from The Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

The pace of cleanup at potentially contaminated military installations and nearby communities also has come under scrutiny by Congress. </p><p><br/>The Defense Department began searching for a fire suppressant that was more effective than water after a horrificfire aboard the USS Forrestal[2]in 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161. <br/>The answer turned out to be a highly effective firefighting foam containing PFAS \u2014 that the Pentagon and other federal agencies like the Forest Service now are struggling to find a substitute for, given the foam's host of potential health and environmental problems. <br/>The federal government's widespread use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are especially strong and don't break down naturally, has spurred concerns for decades. PFAS are used in hundreds of products where resisting heat or repelling water is especially important. That has made them ubiquitous in household items like nonstick pans as well as larger, more industrial applications like firefighting foam. <br/>'The problem with PFAS is it's a highly effective fire remedy. The other problem, of course, is it's indestructible,' House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif., told States Newsroom. 'So we need to find a solution. We need to find a replacement. It's been a lot harder than expected, but they're working on it.' <br/>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a former U.S. Army officer and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said there are concerns about how exactly the Defense Department is phasing out PFAS and if the replacements will be as good as the firefighting foam it uses now. <br/>But, she said, the Pentagon needs to ensure its use of PFAS isn't causing health impacts for people on or near military installations. The Pentagon has identifiedmore than 700 installations[3]where PFAS could have leached into the soil or groundwater, and begun testing to determine how extensive any contamination may be. Testing and cleanup costs are expected to mount into the billions. <br/>'It's still used broadly by a lot of the firefighting units that exist across the DOD. And we don't have a replacement, so that is a huge concern,' Ernst said. 'We need to have the capability of suppressing fires, fighting fires, and until we have a replacement, we'll have to make do.' <br/>While the Forest Service, commercial airports and fire departments also use the fire-suppressing foam that contains PFAS, the U.S. military's choice of a replacement in the coming months will likely have tremendous influence on what other agencies do. <br/> Decades of warnings <br/><br/>The Pentagon had plenty of notice there was a problem with its firefighting foam. <br/>In the 1990s, after years of use, chemical companies issued health notices about the PFAS-containing firefighting foam, triggering initial reviews of the chemical, according to congressional testimony from Richard Kidd, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment and energy resilience. <br/>Kiddtold[4]the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it wasn't until 2016 the Defense Department 'had a final health advisory from the EPA we were able to take measurable actions.' <br/>But, Michael Roark, deputy inspector general for evaluations at the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, noted that in 2011 the Defense Department issued a risk alert saying the PFAS-containing firefighting foam 'contained chemicals that presented a risk to human health and environmental risks that requires special handling and disposal.' <br/>That inspector generalreport[5]on the 2011 risk alert notes the Defense Department was not taking action to regulate or reduce the use of PFAS at that time. <br/>'As a result, people and the environment may have been exposed to preventable risks from PFAS containing AFFF,' the IG report said. <br/>Congress told the Defense Department inthe fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Actto phase out firefighting foam that contains PFAS, but gave the agency years to do it, seeking to balance environmental health and drinking water exposure concerns with the safety of service members fighting fires, according to a U.S. Senate aide, speaking on background. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png\">http://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-15-at-11.04.51-AM.png</url> Department of Defense PFAS map Effective at extinguishing fires <br/><br/>PFAS-containing firefighting foams have been highly effective for extinguishing high-heat liquid fuel fires because of their useful and unique chemical properties. <br/>The carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest in chemistry. <br/>'It's the strongest bond you can make to carbon, and so that makes the molecules very persistent,' said Ryan Sullivan, a chemistry professor and associate director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br/>The man-made chemicals \u2014 in which fluorine atoms have been bonded to carbon atoms \u2014 are really surface active, meaning they spread quickly across a surface and create a film to interrupt the fuel source feeding the fire. <br/>'If you can quickly coat the surface of, say, the (liquid) that's burning or the forest fire with something that doesn't burn and prevents oxygen from getting to the fire, you shut off the fire,' said Sullivan, who began researching PFAS chemicals in 2000. <br/> Contamination near military bases <br/><br/>While the Pentagon has phased out the foam for training to reduce exposure, it's still present in airplane hanger sprinklers, Navy ships and submarines. It's only used if there's an aircraft fire or a plane crash, according to the U.S. Senate aide. <br/>The Defense Department has to report to Congress anytime the foam is accidentally spilled, though decades of PFAS use, in the firefighting foam and other products, has already contaminated military bases and the surrounding communities. <br/>Congress has also placed language in more than one of the annual defense policy bills, calling for the Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a human health assessment. <br/>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said after securing language in the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill for the first nationwide study on the chemical's impact on drinking water that it was 'completely unacceptable that parents in our community, and those in affected communities across the nation, have to worry about the safety of their children's drinking water because of this contamination.' <br/>That led the CDCto begin tracking PFAS contamination near several military sites, including inBerkeley County, West Virginia, near Shepherd Field Air National Guard Base; El Paso County, Colorado, near Peterson Air Force Base; Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska, near Eielson Air Force Base; Hampden County, Massachusetts, near Barnes Air National Guard Base; Lubbock County, Texas, near Reese Technology Center; Orange County, New York, near Stewart Air National Guard Base; New Castle County, Delaware, near New CastleAir National Guard Base; and Spokane County, Washington, near Fairchild Air Force Base. <br/>Results showed that residents living in several of those communities had higher blood levels of certain PFAS chemicals compared to PFAS blood levels nationwide. <br/>Thereport[6], released in September, revealed that residents' blood in Airway Heights, Washington, presented significantly higher levels of two types of PFAS chemicals when compared to national levels, and to the other communities tested. Airway Heights sits in close proximity to the runways at Fairchild Air Force Base and Spokane International Airport. <br/> 'Early phases' of investigation <br/><br/>As of July 2022, the Defense Department had completed preliminary assessments at 476 of the 700 sites determined to have possible PFAS spread, with preparations for cleanup underway at 144 sites, according to a Defense Departmentreport[7]. <br/>Testing and cleanup will cost at least $2.1 billion more than the $1.1 billion the Pentagon's already spent, according toa report[8]to the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency. <br/>'These costs will likely increase significantly, because DOD is still in the early phases of its PFAS investigation,' the GAO wrote. <br/>Senate Defense Appropriations Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said he hopes the Pentagon moves quickly to phase out PFAS wherever it can, noting 'it's a problem in polluting the water and causing cancer.' <br/>'It's a good thing for the military too, because the base cleanup is expensive as s\u2014t,' Tester added. <br/>Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, ranking member on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a written statement she plans to focus on PFAS remediation, cleanup and destruction technology during the upcoming government funding cycle. <br/>'PFAS is linked to thyroid disease, cancer, and birth defects, among other serious diseases,' McCollum said. 'It's clear this is a very serious issue that must be addressed to keep people healthy and safe.' <br/>The funding Congress has approved so far, McCollum said, has led the Pentagon to move toward phasing out firefighting foams, which she called 'one of the most significant uses of PFAS.' <br/>'The DOD must work with the EPA to control these substances similar to the way they do with nuclear waste,' McCollum said. 'In very rare instances, some PFAS products will need to continue to be used in the short term until alternatives exist \u2014 for example, those with national security implications like critical microelectronic production.' <br/>The Environmental Working Group, one of the main advocacy organizations tracking the cleanup effort, has criticized the Defense Department for moving 'slowly.' <br/>'In most cases, they are not even at the point where they're hiring someone to do the cleanup,' saidMelanie Benesh, the organization's vice president for government affairs. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_6538-e1678980374701.jpg\">http://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC_6538-e1678980374701.jpg</url> Wurtsmith Air Museum, near former the Air Force base from which PFAS has contaminated Oscoda | Michael Gerstein Potential risks of PFAS exposure <br/><br/>Scientists and advocates have been sounding the alarm for decades on the potential health impacts of PFAS. <br/>The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry warns studies indicate human exposure to high levels of PFAS 'may' lead to increased cholesterol, increased risk of kidney and testicular cancers, increased risk of high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia during pregnancy, low birth weight, changes in liver enzymes, and decreased vaccine response in children. <br/>'Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects,' the agency states on itswebpage[1]. <br/>As a requirement of the fiscal 2020 defense policy bill, the military in 2021 began testing PFAS levels in the blood of its firefighters during annual exams. <br/>Attention to PFAS, beyond just military bases, has accelerated in recent years. <br/>More than a dozen government agencies allocated just over $250 million on research and development related to PFAS chemicals between 2019 and 2022, according to an interagencyreport[9]mandated by the 2021 defense policy bill. <br/>The bipartisan infrastructure law, enacted in 2021, allocates $5 billion in grants and resources for small and disadvantaged communities to tackle PFAS contamination in drinking water. <br/>The EPA on March 14proposed new standards[10]for six types of PFAS chemicals in drinking water. <br/>If finalized, the agency will regulate PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) to a level of four parts per trillion \u2014 the level at which those chemicals can be reliably detected \u2014 in public drinking water systems. <br/>The rule proposes limits in public drinking water on any mixture of four other specific PFAS chemicals, including types under the brand name GenX, manufactured by the North Carolina-based company Chemours as a replacement for PFOA. <br/>The company, a spin-off of DuPont, touts the effectiveness of its GenX chemicals in the defense, energy and technology sectors, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips \u2014 an industry crucial for the technology supply chain and thetarget of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars[11]in government subsidies and research grants. <br/> Alternative firefighting foam  <br/><br/>In January, the Pentagon releasednew requirements[12]for PFAS-free firefighting foam. <br/>The department has until October to ensure there's an alternative foam on the market that meets the new performance standards and to stop buying any PFAS-containing foams. It then has one additional year, until October 2024, to stop using them entirely. <br/>EPA proposes new rule to crack down on PFAS, forever chemicals in our water[13] <br/>The Pentagon, however, hasn't yet released a list of PFAS-free fire-suppressing foams. <br/>The Naval Sea Systems Command is in the process of reviewing applications from PFAS-free foam manufacturers. Any approved candidates will need to undergo 'various inspections, tests, and evaluations to determine if the product meets the specification,' according to Kelly Flynn, spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense. <br/>The process is expected to take up to 120 days. <br/>The Pentagon's two programs tasked with researching the alternatives have 'conducted rigorous research and demonstration testing for viable PFAS-free solutions,' including some non-foam alternatives. <br/>'There are many viable alternatives for replacing AFFF, however, no single technology is suitable for every situation. The Department continues to evaluate all available technologies to find the best fit for each mission need and level of risk,' Flynn said. <br/>PFAS-free firefighting foam has been on the market for decades and several countries have put it to use extinguishing jet fuel blazes at major international airports, including Australia's Sydney Airport, Dubai International in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom's London Heathrow airport and several European hubs, according to a 2020report[14]from the European Chemicals Agency. <br/>Several U.S. states havepassed or proposed prohibitions[15]on foam that still contains PFAS. Hawaii banned it last year, and bills in theAlaska[16]andMinnesota[17]state legislatures would strictly regulate or outlaw the use of such foams, though with some exceptions. <br/>At the federal level more decisions \u2014 for example, what firefighting foams are used by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 hinge on the Defense Department's decision. <br/>The FAA has until July to develop a plan to transition from the PFAS-containing foam now that the Pentagon has updated its specifications, according to theHouse[18]andSenate[19]reports that accompanied Congress' latest funding law. <br/>'We're waiting to see their list (of alternatives),' said Benesh, fromThe Environmental Working Group. <br/>'There are well over 100 foams that are considered good for Class B fires \u2014 these high-heat, jet-fuel based (fires) \u2014 that are used at airports and fire stations all over the world and have been in development for a long time,' Benesh said. 'Not all of those hundreds of foams will meet the new military standard, but certainly a number of them will.' <br/> [ 1]: <url

There\u2019s been no word on how Biden will handle the issue, even with pressure building on him. The White House has suggested there would be some kind of income criteria that would prevent high earners from benefiting.</p><p>Debt payments were paused by President Donald Trump near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-congress-miguel-cardona-lifestyle-education-2fad4da6c3fee980b5dacc65561ffa81\">Biden has kept the freeze</url> in place while considering a more permanent solution.</p><p>Any decision carries political risks. Republicans accuse Biden of plotting an election-year giveaway. Activists are pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower, and anything less could disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cPresident Biden, canceling $10,000 in student debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. Black students and other students of color are more likely to take out loans to pay for college.</p><p>The announcement about Corinthian, which operated from 1995 to 2015, seeks to close the books on one of the most notorious cases of fraud in American higher education. At its peak, Corinthian was one of the largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100 campuses and more than 110,000 students at its Everest, WyoTech and Heald schools.</p><p>When Harris was California's attorney general, she worked with the Obama administration to uncover how campuses were falsifying data on the success of their graduates. In some cases, schools reported that students had found jobs in their fields of study even though they were working at grocery stores or fast food chains.</p><p>Students told investigators they were often pressured to enroll with promises of lucrative employment, only to end up with huge sums of debt and few job prospects. Federal officials found that the company falsely told students their course credits could be transferred to other colleges.</p><p>Harris said Corinthian tried to attract students who were single parents or unemployed and looking to improve their lives.</p><p>\u201cThe company believed they could get away with it because, as predators are wont to do, they targeted people who they assumed wouldn\u2019t fight back,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of former Corinthian students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but they had to file paperwork and navigate an application process that advocates say is confusing. Now, the relief will be made automatic and extended to additional borrowers.</p><p>Those with a remaining balance on their Corinthian debt will also get refunds on payments already made, department officials said. But the action does not apply to loans paid in full. A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to a question about why that decision was made.</p><p>The Corinthian scandal led to a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges, and the Obama administration promised to forgive loans for Corinthian students whose programs lied about job placement rates. That administration went on to expand a process known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows any defrauded student to apply for debt cancellation.</p><p>The Trump administration drew criticism when it started granting only partial loan cancellation to defrauded students, giving lower levels of relief to those with higher incomes.

Hemp Living has Delta 10 Vape Cartridges in six flavors, Delta 10 Dab Wax in eight flavors, and Delta 10 Gummies in two flavors. All products contain less than 0.3% Delta 9 THC to comply with the 2018 Farm Hemp Bill.</p><p>\"When we released this to the market, we wanted to do it right,\" said A.J. Jacunski, Director of Marketing and Product Development at Hemp Living. \"By using the best-quality distillate, eye-catching packaging, and the hottest flavors, we proudly hit the ground running. There's a lot of fun strains to choose from, like Northern Lights, Watermelon Kush, Blue Widow, and 24K Gold Punch.\u00a0Our goal is to continue expanding our premier Delta 10 product offering, so users can get the best variety and lowest prices\u00a0from industry experts they can rely on.\"</p><p>Delta refers to the molecular structure of THC. Delta 8 is a minor cannabinoid with a double-bonded carbon on the eighth carbon chain. Delta 9 is a major cannabinoid with its double-bonded carbon on the ninth carbon chain, and Delta 10 has its double-bonded carbon on the 10th. Traditional cannabis contains trace amounts of Delta 10, making it difficult to research and use effectively.</p><p>Delta 10 THC was an accidental discovery by a California-based concentrate producer. After purchasing an outdoor-grown cannabis crop grown near a wildfire, the Delta 10 compound was found to be a byproduct of that forest fire. Winds had spread fire-retardant chemicals onto the crop, setting off a chemical reaction that resulted in the formation of unusual crystals that would be later identified as Delta 10 THC. Research has led to a new process that converts CBD into Delta 10 using food-grade chemical agents, making it safer and easier to produce at scale.</p><p>The 2018 Farm Bill legalizes hemp products containing less than 0.3% Delta 9 THC at the Federal level. Delta 10 THC is legal unless specifically deemed illegal by State and/or Local Authorities.</p><p>Delta 10 THC products are available on their retail website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hemplivingusa.com\">http://www.hemplivingusa.com</url>\u00a0and are also available for wholesale and distribution via<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hemplivingwholesale.com\">http://www.hemplivingwholesale.com</url>.</p><p>About Hemp Living</p><p>Hemp Living is a leading licensed Hemp Processor and Distributor located in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Their Delta 8, Delta 10, and CBD products, ranging from Flower, Dabs, Cartridges, and Edibles, have made them a nationally recognized brand in the Hemp Industry. Hemp Living sources its hemp from local Wisconsin farms and conducts third-party lab testing to ensure safe, high-quality Delta 10 products.</p><p>A.J.

There\u2019s been no word on how Biden will handle the issue, even with pressure building on him. The White House has suggested there would be some kind of income criteria that would prevent high earners from benefiting.</p><p>Debt payments were paused by President Donald Trump near the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-congress-miguel-cardona-lifestyle-education-2fad4da6c3fee980b5dacc65561ffa81\">Biden has kept the freeze</url> in place while considering a more permanent solution.</p><p>Any decision carries political risks. Republicans accuse Biden of plotting an election-year giveaway. Activists are pushing him to cancel at least $50,000 per borrower, and anything less could disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cPresident Biden, canceling $10,000 in student debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. Black students and other students of color are more likely to take out loans to pay for college.</p><p>The announcement about Corinthian, which operated from 1995 to 2015, seeks to close the books on one of the most notorious cases of fraud in American higher education. At its peak, Corinthian was one of the largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100 campuses and more than 110,000 students at its Everest, WyoTech and Heald schools.</p><p>When Harris was California's attorney general, she worked with the Obama administration to uncover how campuses were falsifying data on the success of their graduates. In some cases, schools reported that students had found jobs in their fields of study even though they were working at grocery stores or fast food chains.</p><p>Students told investigators they were often pressured to enroll with promises of lucrative employment, only to end up with huge sums of debt and few job prospects. Federal officials found that the company falsely told students their course credits could be transferred to other colleges.</p><p>Harris said Corinthian tried to attract students who were single parents or unemployed and looking to improve their lives.</p><p>\u201cThe company believed they could get away with it because, as predators are wont to do, they targeted people who they assumed wouldn\u2019t fight back,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tens of thousands of former Corinthian students were already eligible for debt cancellation, but they had to file paperwork and navigate an application process that advocates say is confusing. Now, the relief will be made automatic and extended to additional borrowers.</p><p>Those with a remaining balance on their Corinthian debt will also get refunds on payments already made, department officials said. But the action does not apply to loans paid in full. A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to a question about why that decision was made.</p><p>The Corinthian scandal led to a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges, and the Obama administration promised to forgive loans for Corinthian students whose programs lied about job placement rates. That administration went on to expand a process known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows any defrauded student to apply for debt cancellation.</p><p>The Trump administration drew criticism when it started granting only partial loan cancellation to defrauded students, giving lower levels of relief to those with higher incomes.

Animal agriculture is responsible for more than one-fifth of human-induced greenhouse-gas emissions, so PETA wants the mayor to take part in a three-week vegan challenge and will cater it. In a letter sent to Wu's office today, PETA promises that if the mayor accepts the Earth- and animal-saving challenge, the group will provide her with 21 days of vegan vittles, including calzones, buffalo JackFruit chick'n sandwiches, and other fine fare from the best vegan eateries in Beantown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The United Nations agrees with PETA that there's no such thing as a meat- and dairy-eating environmentalist, so it only makes sense for the 'climate mayor' to lead by example and go vegan,\" says PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman. \"PETA is ready to provide the mayor with delicious, free vegan dishes, including butternut squash soup, soy cheese lasagna, and New York-style 'cheese' cake with apricot glaze.\"</p><p>PETAwhose motto reads, in part, that \"animals are not ours to eat\"opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview.</p><p>Note: PETA supports animal rights, opposes all forms of animal exploitation, and provides the public with information about those issues. The group does not directly or indirectly participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office or any political party.</p><p>PETA's letter to Wu follows.</p><p>December 9, 2021</p><p>The Honorable Michelle Wu</p><p>Mayor of Boston</p><p>Dear Mayor Wu:</p><p>Greetings from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). We applaud your passion for climate justice and your commitment to making Boston a zero-emission city. To make it truly \"green,\" the single most important thing that you can do is to set an example for your constituents by going vegan. Will you take PETA's 3-Week Vegan Challenge and urge Bostonians to join you?</p><p>The United Nations says that raising animals for food is \"one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\" Calling for carbon reductions and shifting to renewable energy while still eating meat, eggs, and dairy is like trying to put out a raging forest fire with a single-use plastic water bottle. It's not enough by a long shot, and every animal-based meal actively harms the planet.</p><p>Going vegan makes an immediate difference: Every vegan saves 1,100 gallons of water, nearly 40 pounds of grain (fed mainly to animals raised for food), and 30 square feet of forested land each day. Going vegan also prevents nearly 200 animals every year from being treated like things rather than living beings with beating hearts.</p><p>When asked whether animal protection is a core value, you responded, \"Yes. There must be no tolerance for cruelty to or mistreatment of animals.\" You must know that behind every animal-derived product lies extreme cruelty, including mutilations such as debeaking, dehorning, and castration without painkillers. In slaughterhouses, animals' throats are slit, often while they're still conscious. Many remain alert while they're plunged into the scalding-hot water of defeathering or hair-removal tanks and their bodies are skinned or hacked apart.</p><p>I hope you will lead by example on this critical issue and encourage residents of \"The Athens of America\" to take the most effective action that they can right now to fight the climate crisis. PETA's 3-Week Vegan Challenge can show you how to make this healthy change, and we'd be happy to provide you and your staff with 21 days' worth of vegan meals from the best eateries in Boston if you take us up on this challenge. Are you in?</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Tracy Reiman</p><p>Executive Vice President</p><p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124895515</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:648H-H6T1-JCBF-S539-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 9, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(AP) \u2014 A sweltering heat wave smashed daily temperature records in Montana and Wyoming and complicated the fight to corral several large wildfires, as gusts fanned the blazes and triggered evacuations of some rural areas.</p><p>A temperature of 109 degrees (43 degrees Celsius) was recorded at the airport in Miles City in eastern Montana, where the previous daily record was 97 degrees (35 degrees Celsius), in 1987, the National Weather Service said. The new record approached the highest temperature ever recorded in Miles City at any time of the year.</p><p>Billings, Livingston and Sheridan, Wyoming, also set daily heat records.</p><p>An excessive heat warning was in effect across much of central and eastern Montana and portions of northern Wyoming through 9 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasters warned people to stay out of the sun and not to leave young children and pets in unattended vehicles.</p><p>A red flag warning for extreme fire danger was issued. Strong winds with gusts up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph) were expected.

From Italy to Japan and places in between, records being set day after day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, it is during one of the hottest summers on record that the U.S. climate envoy is meeting with his Chinese counterpart, the world's two largest polluters meeting to restart climate talks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, a crucial grain deal providing food to the world from Ukraine for more than a year is set to expire.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from CNN CENTER, this is CNN NEWSROOM with Michael Holmes.</p><p>HOLMES: And we begin this hour with extreme weather all around the world, bringing dangerous wildfires and heat waves, deadly flooding, and powerful storms to several continents.</p><p>Starting in Asia, where a powerful heat wave is impacting China and Japan; and China has now recorded its highest temperature ever, just over 52 degrees Celsius at one location. In fact, five weather stations in China have topped 50 degrees Celsius in the past day.</p><p>In Southern Europe, the heat wave has been relentless and, of course, it comes right in the middle of the summer tourist season. Climate scientists in Italy say temperatures could reach the hottest ever recorded in Europe, as high as 48 degrees in Sicily and Sardinia.</p><p>Sixteen Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, are under extreme health risks because of the heat.</p><p>People in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain also sweltering.</p><p>On the Spanish island of La Palma, a forest fire is only making matters worse. It's burning out of control and forced at least 4,000 people so far to evacuate. In Italy, at least one person has died, and several tourists have collapsed from the heat. Italian authorities are advising people to stay hydrated and, of course, avoid direct sunlight during the midday hours.</p><p>CNN's Barbie Nadeau with more, reporting from Rome.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's another grueling day here in the center of Rome, and we're here in front of the Roman Coliseum, where you can see behind me just how many tourists are not taking the advice of the officials to stay inside during these hot hours of the day.</p><p>This is a very popular place for tour groups who want to tour the Coliseum, where they meet and gather. And we're just seeing group after group come up here so that they can go down here below me to the Coliseum and go inside, which, of course, is also not air-conditioned or covered.</p><p>We're expecting Rome, on Tuesday, to hit a potentially record-breaking high temperature. And we're also expecting, potentially, the European high temperature to be broken down in Southern Italy and Sicily. That record was set last year.</p><p>And it's not just Italy that's suffering under this intense heat wave. It's also all of Southern Europe. And temperatures in Greece have caused the closing of the Acropolis, one of the most popular tourist attractions, and it's just continuing.</p><p>This heat wave is expected to go on for several more days, meaning as hot as it is today, it's the coolest day for the next several to come.</p><p>Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: A massive heat wave also scorching Americans in the Southern and Western U.S. More than 90 million people under heat alerts. Nearly three dozen daily high temperatures were broken on Sunday alone. And high temperatures are forecast for much of the next week.</p><p>In the Plains and in the Northeast, they've dodged the extreme heat, but they've been dealing with relentless heavy rain and floods.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, authorities are searching for a 2-year-old and an infant who disappeared in floodwaters. The children's mother and four others died in the flooding.</p><p>Storms also caused ground stops at airports around New York City and Boston on Sunday. According to FlightAware.com, more than 1,600 U.S. flights were canceled.</p><p>And that's not all on the extreme weather front. Authorities in South Korea say 40 people have now died from flash floods and landslides in the past few days.</p><p>Thirteen people died in a flooded underpass in central South Korea, extreme weather turning an ordinary road trip into a tragedy. Here's how it happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES (voice-over): Working in mud and against the clock, rescuers in South Korea pump water from a flooded tunnel.</p><p>Arcs of water redirected from the once-clogged underpass, revealing some of the vehicles trapped inside.</p><p>Dash cam video shows how quickly the tunnel filled up on Saturday. Local authorities say a levee broke after days of heavy rain across the country, sending a rush of water through the underpass, some cars barely escaping the deluge.</p><p>But authorities say 15 vehicles, including a bus, were trapped in the tunnel, along with their drivers and passengers.</p><p>Divers have been painstakingly searching for them and have retrieved multiple bodies from the scene. Many family members of those thought to be missing gathered at a nearby hospital, their misery compounded by the agony of a long wait for information.</p><p>One man says he's speechless and says he hasn't eaten for hours while waiting for authorities to brief him.</p><p>The tragedy has shocked South Korea, some people saying the government should have been better prepared after last year's torrential rains, which were the worst in 115 years.</p><p>One man, who lives near the tunnel, says authorities should have closed it when flooding was expected. He says he feels like this could have easily happened to him, and he feels like part of himself died, too.</p><p>Heavy monsoon rains have caused dozens of deaths, not just in the tunnel, but across the country. Thousands of people forced to evacuate because of floods and landslides.</p><p>In some areas, riverbanks completely collapsed because of saturated ground, and meteorologists warn it could get worse, with as much as 300 millimeters of additional rain forecast to fall in some parts of the country over the next few days.</p><p>Other parts of Asia are also dealing with intense weather. Southern China bracing for a powerful storm, which is expected to lash the area with strong winds and heavy rains in the next few days.</p><p>And parts of New Delhi are still water-logged, even though water levels in the Yamuna River, which flooded the city, have receded. But the water hasn't drained away yet, creating very wet and frustrating circumstances for people just trying to move about the city.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: And more dangerous weather is headed for East Asia. Tropical Storm Talim has now strengthened into a typhoon in the South China Sea. It's carrying winds of 120 kilometers an hour at the moment, equivalent to a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane.</p><p>It is expected to make landfall in Southern China in the next 24 hours, and forecasters warn heavy rainfall could trigger flash flooding and landslides.</p><p>And amid all of this right now, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart. They're discussing how to reduce their country's carbon emissions.</p><p>China and the U.S. are the world's largest carbon polluters, and the backdrop for their talks couldn't be more appropriate. They're meeting, of course, in China's capital during the city's hottest ever recorded summer.</p><p>Anna Coren joins me now from Hong Kong. And Anna, together, the U.S. and China account for more than 40 percent of global emissions and are key, of course, for the planet's future. What are the hopes for this visit?</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a lot on the line, as you're saying, Michael. And, you know, John Kerry's visit couldn't be more timely, considering the brutal heat wave across China.</p><p>We are seeing, as we've been showing our viewers, this extreme weather across Asia and, obviously, parts of the world, which experts say is a direct link to global warming.</p><p>China and the U.S., as the world's two largest economies, are the world's two biggest emitters, as you say, accounting for 40 percent of global emissions.</p><p>So there really needs to be global cooperation between the two to make a concerted effort to drastically cut fossil fuel production.</p><p>Now, climate talks between the two countries came to a standstill last August. After then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, Beijing severed talks in protest.</p><p>A long list of other geopolitical issues that have led to a fraught relationship between the two superpowers. But certainly in the last month, there has been a real effort to improve this very important bilateral relationship.</p><p>We saw Antony Blinken, U.S. secretary of state, travel to Beijing last month. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was there just a few weeks ago. And now John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy.</p><p>This morning, Kerry met with China's chief climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, in a conference room overlooking Beijing's Forbidden City.</p><p>These men, Michael, they have history. They worked together in 2021 for COP26 in Glasgow, and really, you know, got some momentum there.</p><p>[00:10:05]</p><p>Then, on the sidelines of COP27 in Egypt last year, when things were obviously quite fractured. And and then, obviously, in January of this year, they talked via video link.</p><p>This morning, Kerry said -- and let me read it to you -- \"In the next three days, we hope we can begin talking some big\" -- taking, I should say -- \"some big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the U.S. to address a common risk threat challenge to all of humanity created by humans themselves.\"</p><p>Now this face-to-face meeting, obviously, very important. It's about resuming this working group on climate cooperation and to pledge, you know, this continuing communication before COP28 in Dubai, which happens at the end of November, Michael.</p><p>And we understand, you know, that that meeting, it's still taking place behind closed doors, but obviously, the hope is that U.S. and China, you know, over Kerry's three-day visit, will really get these two countries on the same page in tackling global climate change.</p><p>Kerry and his delegation will meet with other Chinese officials and possibly, Michael, even Xi Jinping. Experts are sort of saying that -- that, you know, obviously, Kerry met with Xi when he was the U.S. secretary of state under Obama. And some, you know, believe that this would send a very important signal of Beijing's commitment to tackling global warning. So we'll just have to see if that actually takes place.</p><p>HOLMES: Comes at a critical time. Anna, good to see you. Anna Coren there in Hong Kong for us.</p><p>David Sandalow is the inaugural fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. He founded and directs the Center's U.S.-China program. So, a great voice to have at the time of this -- this meeting.</p><p>The impacts of climate change, of course, couldn't be more obvious right now. How much incentive does that offer for the two biggest polluters to make significant progress on this visit?</p><p>DAVID SANDALOW, FELLOW, CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: It underlines the importance of this visit, that China and the United States together are almost 45 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>And in both countries, today, we are having extraordinary, record heat. It's possible that the hottest temperature ever recorded is going to occur in the United States in the next couple of days. And China's got quite a heat wave going on right now, as well.</p><p>We've got all (ph) this problem, and we're not going to do it unless the two largest emitters in the world are talking to each other. HOLMES: Yes, yes. Yes, China, it-s interesting with China, the clear global leader in solar and wind technology and production, but you know, at the same time, they're still wedded to coal as an energy source. I think it's 60 percent of their supply comes from coal.</p><p>What is China doing and what can it do about that dependence?</p><p>SANDALOW: It needs to integrate those renewables into its electric grid in much more rapid fashion than is happening right now.</p><p>Give the Chinese government credit for an enormous build-out of solar power and wind power in the past couple of years. It's extraordinary how much is being built.</p><p>But at the same time, there are tools like more energy storage, like building transmission lines between provinces, like moving towards market mechanisms to sell (ph) the power that would help it use that renewable power much better, much more efficiently. And that would reduce the reliance on coal.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. As you point out, I mean, the two countries account for nearly 40 percent of global emissions. So the U.S. isn't in a position to lecture China.</p><p>But China's emissions are double those of the U.S. What -- what do you see as the level of concern in China about willingness, but importantly, capacity to take significant, urgent action?</p><p>SANDALOW: You know, like many Westerners, I haven't been in China much since the pandemic. And -- and I think this is a bigger problem in the bilateral relationship, is the people-to-people exchange has just dropped dramatically in the past couple of years.</p><p>I think we need to get that going again so people really are talking to each other from in the West and from China; and they understand each other.</p><p>Now, the signals that we see are, I'd say, the following. That the Chinese government takes climate change seriously. It has some very ambitious climate-change goals.</p><p>But in the past couple of years, when those goals have conflicted with energy security goals or economic goals, the latter have tended to win out. So that's one reason -- we say it's called planned approvals (ph). I think it's a focus on energy security, in particular.</p><p>HOLMES: yes. You mention China's impressive advances in renewables, obviously, a good thing. But when it comes to the global picture, and you just touched on this, do you think geopolitics and global competition get in the way?</p><p>I mean, not wanting your foe, for want of a better word, to dominate anything, get a competitive advantage, particularly when it comes to things like solar?</p><p>[00:15:05] SANDALOW: No question. I think the geopolitical tensions make it harder to cooperate on clean energy technologies and on climate change, and it's -- it's a real -- it's a real problem right now.</p><p>I think the United States and China would be better in addressing this problem, if they could do it together in it at least some -- some ways.</p><p>And you know, historically, they have. Historically, the U.S. and China have worked together on some really extremely important agreements that have been reached between the two countries. I hope that can continue in the years ahead. It's certainly not going to be easy.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. Of course, COP28, the climate conference, isn't that far away. How important will that be? And how difficult is it to encourage other nations to take meaningful mitigation steps if the U.S. and China don't lead more in terms of emission reduction?</p><p>I mean, COP is already famous for talking a lot and doing not much.</p><p>SANDALOW: Well, just on your second question about the impact on other countries, is one thing I've seen, as I travel and as I talk to people around the world, countries are looking to the United States and China for action and for leadership.</p><p>So I think without the United States and China taking strong steps, it is harder to -- to motivate action in other -- in other countries.</p><p>I think it's going to be important -- COP -- these COPs go -- they're Conference of the Parties. They're called COPs. I think it's an important one. There is -- these tend to go in cycles. And I think we're ready for a COP that's going to make a big difference. There's some -- some very -- very capable leadership of this COP.</p><p>So I think there's a potential for a real step forward at this meeting. But -- but as I think you are just alluding to, these -- these meetings tend to go very slowly. By their nature, these big conferences of the parties require 150, 100 -- you know, almost 200 countries to agree. So things move quite slowly in these meetings.</p><p>HOLMES: Yes. Well, if the Northern Hemisphere weather at the moment doesn't convince people them it's time to do something, nothing will.</p><p>SANDALOW: Yes.</p><p>HOLMES: David Sandalow, I wish we had more time. We've got to leave it there. Thank you so much.</p><p>SANDALOW: Michael, thanks for having me.</p><p>HOLMES: World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz says winning Wimbledon is a dream come true. Well, you would say that, wouldn't you?</p><p>The Spaniard defeated reigning champion Novak Djokovic in a thrilling top-quality five set men's final on Sunday. Alcaraz prevailed after nearly five hours on center court.</p><p>The 20-year-old becomes the third youngest Wimbledon champion in the Open era. After winning, he paid tribute to Djokovic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLOS ALCARAZ, WIMBLEDON 2023 CHAMPION: You inspire me a lot. You know, I started playing tennis, watching -- watching you, I mean, since I -- since I was born. You know, you were -- you were already winning tournaments. You know, it's amazing. Probably you (UNINTELLIGIBLE) than me. You just said that 36 is the new 26. And you make -- you made that happen. But it's amazing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Good on him. What a terrific match it was. We'll have more on Carlos Alcaraz's win coming up in WORLD SPORT in about 30 minutes or so from now.</p><p>Now, Ukraine's grain and world food prices might be on the line. The deal to allow Ukraine to export its grain expires in just hours. Coming up, why Vladimir Putin alone can keep it going or let it die.</p><p>Also, Russia's classrooms become bleak monuments to the country's fallen soldiers. A special report on the Kremlin's efforts to stamp out dissent in schools.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[00:21:08]</p><p>HOLMES: And we have gotten word, in the last hour or so, of an emergency on the Kerch Bridge. That is the only land link between Russian-occupied Crimea and the Russian mainland.</p><p>Multiple sources say that two blasts hit the bridge around 3 a.m. on Monday, local time. CNN has not independently confirmed that, but there are a lot of reports about it.</p><p>Traffic on the stand (ph) is stopped at the moment. Officials say emergency agencies are on the scene.</p><p>This coming hours after Russia says it repelled a Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea's largest city.</p><p>Now, to the West, the last ship protected under the Black Sea grain deal and with Russia has left of the port of Odessa in Ukraine. That deal, which allowed safe passage for Ukrainian grain, will expire later on Monday unless Russia extends it.</p><p>President Vladimir Putin has complained the agreement is unfair to Russia, but he's still agreed to previous extensions, despite threatening to pull out of the deal.</p><p>Now, the U.N. has offered Russia some financial concessions to try to keep them in play. Meanwhile, President Putin calling Washington's agreement to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions a crime, despite widespread evidence his own forces have repeatedly used those same weapons in Ukraine. The Russian leader flatly denying it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I want to note that Russia has a sufficient supply of various types of cluster munitions. Various types.</p><p>Until now, we have not done this. We have not used them and we have not had such a need, despite the well-known shortage at a certain period of time. And we also have ammunition. But we have not done this.</p><p>But, of course, if they were used against us, we reserve the right to mirror these actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Odessa and has more on the grain deal deadline and the latest from the battlefield.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Ukraine says there has been an escalation in the fighting in the Eastern part of the country, that there are fierce battles underway, and that the Russian and Ukrainian sides are changing positions dynamically. That's according to Ukraine's deputy defense minister.</p><p>MARQUARDT (voice-over): In the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces are in the -- on the defensive as Russian forces have managed to make some advances there, as well as a little bit farther South.</p><p>And then, around the city of Bakhmut, which has seen the fiercest fighting during this entire war, most of which the city is now controlled by Russian forces.</p><p>There, Ukrainian troops are trying to push forward. They are holding grounds to the North of the city while trying to push forward to the South of the city.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Meanwhile, we are here in Odessa, where the Black Sea grain initiative is set to expire on Monday at midnight. That critical deal allowed Ukrainian grain to be exported to the world from here in Odessa.</p><p>MARQUARDT (voice-over): That deal was struck between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey. It is set to expire Monday at midnight. The last ship has now already left from the Odessa port.</p><p>Russia complains that this deal is one-sided, that it only benefits Ukraine. MARQUARDT: And Russia continues to be punished financially. Russia would like to see its agricultural bank put back on the swift, international payment system.</p><p>Now, if this deal is not renewed, it could lead to a spike in global grain prices, to threats to the global food supply, as well as damage to the Ukrainian economy. And the United Nations continues to negotiate with the Russian side to prevent this grain deal from lapsing.</p><p>Alex Marquardt, CNN, in Odessa.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: Classrooms across Russia are slowly becoming bleak monuments to the country's war dead. It's all part of a patriotic program by the Kremlin and a means to stamp out early seeds of dissent against the war in Ukraine and the Putin regime.</p><p>[00:25:04]</p><p>CNN's Clare Sebastian with that story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're marching, not perfectly in time. But what this ceremony lacks and military precision, it makes up for in propaganda value.</p><p>These children in central Russia will now get the chance to sit at a new desk, emblazoned with the face of one of Russia's war dead, a former pupil at this school, killed just three days into the invasion.</p><p>His grieving mother, struggling through.</p><p>These so-called hero desks, turning classrooms into bleak memorials of a death toll Russia has otherwise tried to hide, are actually part of a government initiative. Russia's ruling party says they now number over 14,000. They will apparently include veterans of other wars.</p><p>DANLIL KEN, HEAD, ALLIANCE OF TEACHERS UNION: We see his picture, his name. He was our pupil just seven years ago. He tried to save our country. And for young people, very young people. it's hard not to feel the pain from that.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Danlil Ken, head of an openly anti-Kremlin teachers union, now living outside Russia, says the atmosphere in schools changed overnight when the war started.</p><p>Information so tightly controlled, he says multiple teachers have been fired, some even fined for speaking up.</p><p>A fate that Olga, a teacher in St. Petersburg -- we've changed her name and disguised her identity for safety reasons -- narrowly avoided. \"OLGA\", TEACHER IN ST. PETERSBURG: I also tried to convince my colleagues that our country has committed a crime. One week later, the director of the school invited me to talk, and she warned me that, if I continue, then she will have to appeal to a special body of the state. She meant FSB.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And then there are the not-so-subtle curriculum changes. This video on the Crimean bridge, part of a new state-controlled weekly lesson series launched last year, called Conversations about Important Things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): \"It's not just a transport crossing,\" the speaker explains, \"but a spiritual crossing.\"</p><p>No mention of the huge explosion that caused part of the bridge to collapse a few months earlier.</p><p>History is being re-written in the textbooks. This will now include the so-called special military operation. And it's not just recent history.</p><p>\"OLGA\": It is an historic fact that the Russian state began with Kyiv, Kyivskaya Russia, so to say. But nowadays, the new textbooks of history are issued where this idea is removed.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Scenes like this at a school in Crimea will also likely become much more common. Basic military preparation, a throwback to Soviet times, set to officially re-enter the school curriculum for older classes.</p><p>KEN (through translator): It's a cheap, simple method of reaching a very large audience and to get across the government's position. It is, in essence, moral violence against children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Education for comment on the purpose of these changes and got no response.</p><p>Sitting at these hero desks, in many schools, a reward for only the best students. A morbid incentive designed to breed a generation patriotic enough to accept a war whose consequences they are sure to inherit.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: Iran is cracking down on women's freedoms yet again, state media reporting the country's so-called Morality Police have resumed controversial patrols to impose the country's strict Islamic dress code, including the hijab.</p><p>Officials say those who don't comply might face legal action. Some women, though, pushing back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Do you think the Morality Police can prevent women from not wearing a hijab? They cannot impose it like before. The number of people who do not obey is too high now. They cannot handle all of us. The last thing they can do is use violence and force against us. They cannot do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOLMES: Now, the move comes ten months after the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after she was detained for allegedly not wearing her hijab correctly.</p><p>In the coming hours, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will chair a weekly cabinet meeting one day after being released from the hospital. He was admitted on Saturday for what doctors say was dehydration amid an ongoing heat wave in the country.</p><p>CNN's Hadas Gold with more on that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[00:30:01]</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released from the hospital Sunday morning, this after being admitted on Saturday afternoon after feeling reportedly dizzy, according to his office.</p><p>His office saying that, on Friday, he spent part of the day at the Sea of Galilee. This entire region has been under a major heat wave. And the Sea of Galilee in particular was under a heat advisory.</p><p>The prime minister himself saying in a video statement that he went to the Sea of Galilee without a hat, without water, was in the sun, saying it was not a good idea.</p><p>So after feeling dizzy on Saturday, he went to the emergency room where, after undergoing a series of tests, the hospital has determined, they said on Sunday morning, that it was as a result of dehydration.</p><p>And they did a series of other tests, including on his heart, that they said all came out as normal, saying that the prime minister is in good condition.</p><p>However, they did decide that, in order to be able to continue monitoring, they have implanted him with a continuous heart monitor. This is a small device about an inch, inch and a half long that goes just under the skin, that is able to provide continuous, 24/7 heart monitoring.</p><p>So although the doctors there are saying that all the tests came out normal, they decided to implant him with his heart monitor, although he now has been discharged.</p><p>Now, the prime minister has no known major health conditions, but he is 73 years old. It's been very hot here, and this is not the first time he's gone to hospital in the past year.</p><p>Last October he also reported feeling unwell. He was taken to the emergency room, was kept there overnight, and released the next morning.</p><p>It's also been a very intense period in Israel and across the region, the rising levels of violence across the West Bank and Israel, as well as increasing political strife that Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing internally.</p><p>But as far as we understand right now, Benjamin Netanyahu has now been released back home, and his doctors saying that he is in the condition, but he now has this new heart monitor.</p><p>Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOLMES: Still to come on the program, new economic data out of Beijing shows the bounce-back from COVID-19 may have run its course. We'll break down the numbers in a live report after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOLMES: China's economy slowed to less than 1 percent growth in the second quarter of this year.

So walk us through the data and what it says about the pace of China's economic recovery, post-COVID?</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR/CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Michael, China's economy is struggling to gain traction. Economic growth is stronger, if you compare it to last year. That was when lockdowns gripped the country.</p><p>But the pace of recovery, after the pandemic, after zero-COVID, is slowing down. And adding to the overall negative economic picture, we've learned that China's youth unemployment rate has hit another record high of 21.3 percent in June.</p><p>So pressure is building on Beijing to roll out more stimulus measures soon.</p><p>Now, according to official data out this morning, China's GDP grew 6.4 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, but it grew only 0.8 percent in the second quarter from the first three months of the year, when it expanded to 2.2 percent.</p><p>And, according to Mattie Bekink of the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network, she says this. She says, quote, \"China's post- reopening recovery has fallen short of expectations.\"</p><p>She goes on to say, \"Sources of stress relate to excess capacity and the manufacturing sector relative to soft demand; an ephemeral recovery in the housing market; the deleveraging of the household sector; subdued income growth and elevated youth unemployment; and strains in local public finances.\" Quite a long list there.</p><p>Economists say that China is essentially counting the costs of weak demand, both at home and abroad. Remember, there is that fresh data out last week. It showed China's exports fell at their fastest pace in three years in June.</p><p>Another factor: the so-called scarring effects of zero-COVID. And because of the uncertainty that was caused by this harsh pandemic policies last year, it caused consumers and businesses to save more, instead of buying more, instead of making purchases and investments.</p><p>Now, looking ahead, investors have their eyes on an expected Politburo this month. The government has promised to make stimulating consumer spending a priority. All eyes on that meeting.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>HOLMES: All right. Kristie, good to see you. Kristie Lu Stout there in Hong Kong with the very latest for us.</p><p>Now, months after billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter, the company has not only abandoned its office in Africa, but it's also abandoned some of its staff there.</p><p>A group of former employees spoke exclusively with CNN about what has been an ordeal for them.</p><p>About a dozen team members were laid off just four days after Twitter opened an office in Accra, which is Ghana's capital. They say they accepted Twitter's offer to pay three months' severance, repatriation costs, and legal expenses from negotiating with the company.</p><p>But, in the nine months since then, ex-employees claim Twitter has not followed through, one saying the company literally ghosted them.

As of March 25, the state reported more than 30,000 new cases, more than half of which are in the five boroughs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the city and state regularly publish health data on COVID-19, those data may be difficult for the researchers to easily access and interpret, let alone for the average New Yorker. To address this challenge, Micaela Martinez, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences, has been aggregating city and state data and creating graphics to provide an easy-to-understand picture of the pandemic in New York. She updates the site every 24 to 48 hours, as new data become available.</p><p>\"I was motivated to create this page because New York is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., and I didn't see any place where the local data were being mapped and presented for the public and the research community,\" Martinez says.</p><p>At the top of the website this week, a chart illustrates the steep rise in coronavirus cases in New York State and the distribution of cases within New York City (Brooklyn and Queens report the most cases, Staten Island, the least). Another chart looks at the number of cases and deaths by age and sex in the city. More young people ages 18 to 44 have tested positive than any other age group, although those aged 75 and older were much more likely to die. More men have tested positive than women, and men also had a slightly higher risk of death.</p><p>\"This is a resource that everyone in New York may want to check regularly,\" says Andrea Baccarelli, chair of environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman.</p><p>SEASONALITY OF COVID-19</p><p>Martinez is an infectious disease ecologist whose focus is the seasonality of infectious diseases and the impact of biological rhythms on disease. She argues in a 2018 article in the journal PLOS Pathogens that all infectious diseases have a seasonal element (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/mark-your-calendar-all-infectious-diseases-are-seasonal\">https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/mark-your-calendar-all-infectious-diseases-are-seasonal</url>).</p><p>There has been a lively debate in scientific circles about whether or not COVID-19 will spread less quickly in the summer months. One clue might be the behavior of other coronaviruses. There are four coronaviruses currently endemic in the United States which circulate regularly and are a major cause of the common cold. Like SARS-COVID-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, these other coronaviruses cause respiratory illness, although much less severe. All four of the endemic coronaviruses are seasonal.</p><p>\"These endemic coronaviruses have a wintertime seasonality, meaning we see more cases in the colder months,\" says Martinez. \"However, it is still too early to tell if the novel coronavirus will behave in the same way.\"</p><p>Even if new cases slow in the summer, she says it won't be enough to end the pandemic when most of the world is susceptible to infection because they haven't gained immunity to the virus. \"Susceptible individuals are analogous to kindling for a forest fire; when there is a lot of kindling the fire can rage on. Summertime could bring with it a decline in transmission, but like a big forest fire, even if it rains, it can slow the pace of growth, but it won't stop it completely.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7068615 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7068615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHM-PC41-JC11-154G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 27, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Both items relate to the same part of the Book of Order (G-3.0106). Sponsoring POL-17 was Philadelphia Presbytery. Sheppards and Lapsley Presbytery sponsored POL-10.</p><p>After the committee heard from resource staff and overture advocates discussing, there was commissioner support for combining the two items of business into a substitute motion.</p><p>The committee broke into crystallization small groups, as they had to good effect on day 2, and heard more from overture advocates, including Denis Anderson speaking on behalf of the Racial Equity Advocacy Committee (REAC). REAC had written in its overture response that Noticeably absent is the language related to addressing systemic and structural racism, and suggested adding language to that effect.</p><p>Despite one commissioners speaking out against combining the two business items, saying the committee could be creating a forest fire, support for combining the items continued to grow.</p><p>Another approach from the day before was reprised by the commissioners: adding comments to motions to help advise the Assembly in a non-binding way.</p><p>After voting to include one such comment recommending a 1998 denominational standard of ethics to councils of the church in their development and adoption of these policies, (earlier amendments had removed a proposed phrase about cultural and systemic racism), Maureen Wright, Committee Parliamentarian, gave what she called a remedial reminder of where the group found itself in the procedural process road map.</p><p>The You are here spot of the moment was Perfecting the substitute motion, which is what the committee proceeded to do, voting 17 to 12 to add the comment to the substitute motion.</p><p>Moderator Thornburg declared the substitute motion perfect and the committee voted to replace the main motion with it, with 24 votes for and 4 against.</p><p>Wright pointed out a cleaner way to get the substance of the combined items of business to the full Assembly: sending the approved POL-10 (containing language from POL: 17) on with one vote and with another telling the Assembly that POL-17 had been handled by POL-10.</p><p>Thats what the committee did, with the initial vote 25 for and 3 against, and the second 25 to 1.</p><p>From there the committee turned to its last scheduled item of business, with Moderator Thornburg thanking all for their patience and urging renewed attention.</p><p>POL-15 : A Resolution on Receiving Immigrant Pastors as Members of the PresbyteryFrom the Racial Equity Advocacy Committee began with Carmen Rosario of REAC, which had brought the resolution, speaking in support. She referenced changes that had been advised by the Advisory Committee on the Constitution (ACC) and requested they be incorporated whole-cloth into the resolution. Anna Kendig Flores, speaking for the General Assembly Committee on Representation, said GACOR also supported the resolution as changed.</p><p>With the ACCs language advice added, the resolution continued to acknowledge the difficulties faced by many immigrant pastors trying to satisfy the denominations standard ordination exams early in their pastorate. The resolution also included changes to the Book of Order that instruct presbyteries to use other approaches they deem appropriate to provide such educational and mentorship opportunities as seem necessary and prudent for that ministers successful ministry in the presbytery.</p><p>Again the committee broke into small groups to discuss POL-15. The difference between may and should (words found in the resolution) was parsed, with a consensus view that may was less binding, and in this matter wholly appropriate.</p><p>Voting to amend the main motion inserting the ACC language changes passed with 25 yes votes. Then the committee voted to approve the amended motion with 28 yes votes. There was an identical result on a procedural vote to send the approved motion to the Assembly.</p><p>With a final unanimous vote to receive the report of the General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission, the committees business concluded. The commissioners and advisory delegates, the moderator and vice moderator, the resource staffall made a joyful noise, joining their politely Presbyterian ruckus to the committees who had finished earlier in the day.</p><p>Over three days the Polity Committee had found tactics that worked well for its members, including small groups that helped crystallize ideas about the substance of proposals before leadership walked the body through the procedural steps of amendments and motions.</p><p>Moderator Thornburg told the GA News that another person from the committee had come up with the idea to use the crystallization sessions, which were first tried when Vice Moderator Hartman was behind the leadership microphone on the afternoon of day 2. From that point forward, every item saw the committee break into small group discussions.</p><p>As for a commissioners perspective, Denise Pass from Plains and Peaks told the GA news that issues she had shared on day 1 with using hearing aids together with headphones continued into day 3. She liked being able to follow along with the motions inside PC-Biz. She recommended other commissioners use a laptop for their committee work inside the Center, a full keyboard and mouse making it quicker to submit proposed amendments.</p><p>It was great to have PC-Biz available, she said. Being even more intentional, deliberate, and slow would help with frustrations some commissioners had felt earlier in the process, including participants accessing interpretation in Spanish or Korean.</p><p>Getting more feedback from commissioners like Pass will help the Assembly with future meetingsnot only because of the increasing number of digital tools and resources being used, but the perennial struggle commissioners and advisory delegates face working through procedural steps decently and in order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125293457</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65S3-N9F1-JCBF-S45N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1134\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 22, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp; XENOPHOBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001556</classCode><className>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001444</classCode><className>RACE &amp; ETHNICITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPRD</classCode><className>RACIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DPKD</classCode><className>SYSTEMIC RACISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX623</classCode><className>LOUISVILLE, KY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Anthony English, Georgia Forestry Commission Wildland Urban Interface Specialist, of Cornelia, GA has won the Robert E. Browning award for 2019 in Georgia.</p><p>\"This recognition from the U.S. Forest Service is an outstanding achievement for Anthony and for our agency,\" said Georgia Forestry Commission Director Tim Lowrimore. \"Anthony is known for his collaborative work with all of our partners and cooperators to get the message out about the importance of wildfire prevention. North Georgians and the landscape itself have benefitted from the outreach he's done to lessen the possibility of dangerous wildfires.\"</p><p>The Robert E. Browning Award was established by the U.S. Forest Service in 1990 to recognize employees, groups or projects that are extremely valuable to the fire prevention effort. In 1994, the award's name was changed to memorialize the loss of Robert Browning, who died fighting a wildfire in Colorado. Each State Fire Chief or the Forest Fire Management Officer is allowed to nominate one individual or group each year.</p><p>English was nominated for the award by Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest Service Fire Management Officer Mike Davis. In his nomination documents, Davis lauded English for numerous activities that promoted wildfire prevention. They included media appearances, extensive promotion of the Firewise USA program, many stints portraying Smokey Bear, and an assignment to the North Georgia Wildfire Prevention &amp; Education Team during a flash drought period that was beginning to rival historic 2016 fall fire season conditions. Records indicate English's program outreach over the past five years impacted close to 29,000 people at events large and small across north Georgia, yet Davis believes the impressions total several hundred thousand because of his collaborative efforts.</p><p>\"I'm flattered and honored to receive this award,\" said English. \"People remember the 2016 fires in North Georgia and those in California. It's encouraging that what we do has real meaning for them and can make a difference.\" For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR3703400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61XV-NGV1-F12F-F454-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><timeReceived>8:37 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd.

This Supplementary Information section is arranged as follows:</p><p>Table of Contents</p><p>I. Background</p><p>II. Washington's Smoke Management Plan</p><p>III. Evaluation of Washington's SIP Submittal</p><p>IV. EPA's Proposed Action</p><p>V. Incorporation by Reference</p><p>VI. Statutory and Executive Orders Review</p><p>I. Background</p><p>Each state has a State Implementation Plan (SIP) containing the control measures and strategies to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the criteria pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide). The SIP contains such elements as air pollution control regulations, emission inventories, attainment demonstrations, and enforcement mechanisms.</p><p>Washington adopted a Smoke Management Plan as part of the Washington SIP to reduce emissions that contribute to visibility impairment. Wildfire has had a serious impact on Washington during the past decade with many large-scale wildfires impacting air quality. Prescribed fires[1] have been increasingly used as a land management tool to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires by reducing the buildup of unwanted fuels and strengthening an area's ecosystems. This controlled application of fire to wildland fuels, is done under specific environmental conditions and protocols that typically call for a prescribed fire to be confined to a predetermined area and limit the fire to an intensity and scale required to attain planned forestland management objectives. The State anticipates increasing the application of prescribed fire in response to the increasing threat of wildfires in Washington. The state intends to balance the need to increase the use of prescribed fire as a forest management tool while minimizing smoke impacts through the implementation of policies and processes outlined in Washington's Smoke Management Plan (SMP).</p><p>EPA first approved Washington's SMP into the Washington SIP in 1987 (52 FR 16243, May 4, 1987) as part of Washington's visibility protection plan. Washington updated and EPA approved the SMP in 1998 (1998 SMP) and 2003 respectively (68 FR 34821, June 11, 2003). In 2016, the Washington State Legislature provided funding to update the 1998 SMP and the Legislature made changes to statutes affecting the SMP in 2019 and 2021. After revising rules to reflect the updated legislation, Washington updated the SMP to reflect the statutory and regulatory changes. On August 10, 2022, following a state public comment process, the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) submitted the updated SMP, including the statutes and regulations relied on in the Plan, to EPA for approval (2022 SMP).</p><p>II. Washington's Smoke Management Plan</p><p>Washington's SMP establishes a program to allow silvicultural burning on forestland while protecting air quality. Although Ecology is the primary delegated air quality agency for the state and submitted the Washington SMP to EPA for approval, Washington's Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has been and continues to be the state agency with the responsibility for regulating smoke from silvicultural burning on forestland. See Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70A.15.5120 and RCW 70A.15.5130. The Washington SMP is therefore primarily implemented by DNR with assistance from Ecology.</p><p>DNR oversees prescribed silvicultural burning in Washington to improve fire dependent ecosystems, mitigate wildfire potential, decrease forest susceptibility to insects or disease, and otherwise enhance forest resiliency to fire. The purpose of the SMP is to coordinate and facilitate the statewide regulation of prescribed, silvicultural (forestland) burning on lands under the authority of DNR, and on unimproved, federally managed forestlands and participating tribal lands. The SMP applies to all persons, landowners, companies, state and Federal land management agencies, and others who conduct silvicultural burning in Washington State. The SMP does not apply to agricultural burning, outdoor burning that occurs on improved property, or tribal lands described in Section VI of this document.</p><p>For purposes of discussing the Washington SMP, prescribed fires fall into three main categories based on the size of the burn: \"rule burns,\" \"small burns,\" and \"large burns.\" The approval process for burns under the SMP[2] also varies based on whether the burn is a \"multiple day burn\" and whether the burn is conducted in an urban growth area.</p><p>\"Rule burns\" are generally no more than ten feet in diameter and are always limited to one fire at a time. They include burning of hand-built piles for recreational purposes, as well as fuels reduction, or other silvicultural purposes. Rule burns may also be restricted to no more than 4 feet in diameter depending on time of year and the county within which the burning occurs.[3] DNR has authority over rule burns, but no written permit or site-specific burn approval or decision is required under either the 1998 SMP or 2022 SMP for rule burns, provided the burns comply with minimum requirements for all burns listed in WAC 332-24-205[4] and the specific provisions for rule burns in WAC 332-24-211. No changes have been made to WAC 332-24-211, since EPA approved it into the Washington SIP in 2003. The \"Scope\" sections in both the 1998 SMP and 2022 SMP state that the SMP does not apply to burning done \"by rule\" (\"rule burns\").</p><p>\"Small burns\" require site-specific written permits and are defined under the 2022 SMP as fires that will consume less than 100 tons of forest debris[5] in a 24-hour period. The size threshold is extended to 300 tons in \"low-risk areas.\" \"Low risk areas\" are generally remote areas and are defined by DNR using the criteria described in Appendix 10 of the 2022 SMP. Burners intending to conduct small burns are required to obtain a site-specific written permit.[6] DNR conditions such permits based on the proposed locations and may include specific instructions in the permits, such as limits on wind directions under which the burns may be conducted. Burners are required to follow all conditions in their burn permits. Prior to igniting a small burn, the burner must also call 1-800-323 BURN and follow the instructions that apply for the day and location of the burn being conducted. Burners cannot ignite small burns if an air quality episode is declared, or conditions of impaired air have been declared by Ecology or the local clean air authority as provided under RCW 70A.15.5140 and WAC 332-24-205(5). DNR may also suspend small burns on private and state lands due to high fire danger (Federal officials manage fire danger on Federal lands). In contrast to large burns, small burns conducted outside of urban growth areas do not require a site-specific burn decision just prior to the burn. Small burns within urban growth areas are not treated the same as other small burns but instead must undergo the same permitting process as large burns.</p><p>\"Large burns\" are defined as fires that will consume 100 tons or more in a 24-hour period (300 tons or more in low risk areas). Like small burns, large burns require site-specific permits; burners must follow all conditions in their burn permits; ignition is prohibited if an air quality episode is declared or conditions of impaired air have been declared by Ecology or the local clear air authority as provided under RCW 70A.15.5140 and WAC 332-24-205(5); and DNR may suspend large burns on private and state lands due to high fire danger (Federal officials manage fire danger on Federal lands). The distinction here from small burns outside of UGA's is that prior to igniting a large burn outside of UGA's, the burner must contact DNR directly and request authorization to ignite the large burn on a particular day. The SMP identifies eight specific burn approval criteria to be met before DNR decides whether ignition will be authorized for large burns (and small burns inside urban growth areas) and tasks DNR wildland fire management division managers with assessing the potential for smoke intrusions. To inform decisions, DNR utilizes numerous tools as well as site- and temporal-specific considerations, including, but not limited to, current and forecasted weather conditions, air quality, fuel moisture, firing techniques, and availability of suppression forces.</p><p>\"Multiple day burns\" are subject to the same approval criteria used to approve large burns, regardless of burn size. Additional information and actions are required from burners before DNR will approve a multiple day burn. Those additional requirements are in the SMP in the Approval Process for Multiple Day Burns section and include, but are not limited to, notifying DNR at least three months before the proposed start of the burn, providing a rationale for why the burn cannot be accomplished in single day increments, providing communication and public notification plans, obtaining spot forecasts for each day of the burn, identifying what monitoring resources will be utilized, and participating in daily coordination calls.</p><p>Although the 2022 SMP burn approval criteria prohibit authorizing burns that would cause an exceedance of air quality standards, DNR's goal as stated in the SMP is based on levels below the 35 ug/m[3] 24-hour NAAQS for PM2.5 .[7] This is a new element of the 2022 SMP. Under the 2022 SMP, DNR now considers exceeding a PM2.5 level of 20.5 ug/m[3] (on a 3-hour rolling average) a smoke \"intrusion\" and unacceptable for purposes of the SMP.[8] The 2022 SMP sets forth new procedures to avoid, detect, and respond to smoke intrusions. These procedures include, but are not limited to:</p><p>Incorporating consideration of potential intrusions when making burn decisions;</p><p>Using available resources such as monitors and webcams to assess the level of smoke in potentially impacted communities;</p><p>Reporting and documenting where and when smoke intrusions occur;</p><p>Issuing health advisories as needed and collaborating with Ecology, Washington Department of Health, and local clean air authorities;</p><p>Requiring burners to submit intrusion reports when DNR determines one has occurred; and</p><p>Sharing all data and final intrusion reports with applicable partners and regulators, including Ecology, local clean air authorities, state and local health departments, and EPA.</p><p>In the 2022 SMP, DNR commits to reviewing the SMP every five years and revising the plan or procedures as necessary as a result of that review. The SMP specifies that plan revisions will adopt the same review procedures used for the original adoption. The EPA notes that any revision to the SMP would not be part of the Washington SIP unless submitted to and approved by the EPA as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7410.</p><p>III. Evaluation of Washington's SIP Submittal</p><p>As with its previous SMP, Washington's 2022 SMP submittal includes an extensive discussion of how the state implements its smoke management program as well as the statutes and regulations that apply to prescribed burning on forest land in Washington. Washington states that it revised its SMP to better regulate burning while reducing fuel loading, restore forest ecosystems, and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire while continuing to protect air quality. The revisions include changes to both the main body of the SMP as well as state statutes and regulations that apply to prescribed burning and are included in Appendix 7 of the submittal.[9]</p><p>The bulk of revisions in the 2022 SMP are non-substantive from a SIP approvability perspective and include reorganizing the order of SMP sections and content; updating wording for consistency and more current vernacular; and updating citations to reflect recodification of applicable statutes and rules. Washington also revised the SMP to add or clarify recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for prescribed fires that may later qualify as an \"exceptional event\" under 40 CFR 50.14. This is also a non-substantive change to Washington's SMP because EPA is not approving or disapproving this SMP as meeting the requirements of EPA's exceptional event guidance.[10]</p><p>The 2022 SMP also contains several substantive revisions to the SMP. Those revisions affect burn decision timing, burn approval criteria, summer weekend burning, and burning in urban growth areas. Washington included in the submittal information to demonstrate that these revisions to the SMP will not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment or reasonable further progress or any other applicable requirement of Title I of the CAA. See 42 U.S.C. 7410(l). The most relevant pollutants for Washington's analysis of visibility and interference with NAAQS attainment are PM2.5, PM10, and ozone due to the nature of prescribed fire emissions and because EPA revised the PM2.5 and ozone NAAQS resulting in more stringent standards (78 FR 3085, January 15, 2013, and 80 FR 65292, October 26, 2015) since EPA last approved Washington's SMP.[11] The substantive changes to the 2022 SMP and the demonstration supporting the changes are discussed below.</p><p>Burn Decision Timing</p><p>Under the current approved 1998 SMP, \"large burns\" require that DNR issue a site-specific smoke management decision (permission to ignite) the morning of the day the fire is to be ignited. Under the 2022 SMP, if a burner submits a request to DNR by noon the \"day prior\" to the planned ignition, DNR must issue a decision by 4:00 p.m. that same day--about 15 hours earlier than what would be expected under the 1998 SMP. The result of this change is reliance on products, primarily meteorological forecasts and models that are produced earlier and, due to advances in science and technology, are more reliable than what would have been available when the 1998 SMP was created.</p><p>Washington's demonstration included a technical analysis[12] of forecast models used for day of versus day prior to ignition in the 2022 SMP. The technical analysis of the revised protocols shows no appreciable loss in forecast accuracy and indicates DNR would likely make the same operational burn decision regardless of whether the decision is rendered by 4:30 p.m. on the day prior to ignition or 8:00 a.m. on the day of ignition. The analysis also shows that, in the season when most burn decisions are made (fall), model runs the day prior to a burn have slightly smaller wind speed forecast errors than the day-of-burn model runs (wind speed is a significant factor for burn decisions). This lends confidence that a status-quo or better burn decision will be made.</p><p>In addition, this burn decision timing change is not a complete departure from the procedure under the 1998 SMP. Burners seeking day prior burn decision approval under the 2022 SMP must submit their request by noon the day prior to ignition. Failure to do so may result in a burn decision on the day of ignition, instead of by 4:30 p.m. on the day prior to ignition. Burners may still request a burn decision on the planned day of ignition.</p><p>More importantly, there are protections in the burn approval process in the 2022 SMP based on air quality on the morning of ignition.[13] Specifically, the 2022 SMP states that on the day of the burn \"If the burn was approved, the Smoke Management Section will verify weather conditions have not changed so much as to result in a violation of the Approval Criteria, by 7:30 a.m. If weather conditions have unexpectedly changed burners will be notified and advised that they may have to extinguish, and therefore are advised to not burn that location.\" This 2022 SMP weather verification requirement applies to large burns and all burns in urban growth areas, regardless of size.</p><p>For these reasons, including the technical demonstration supporting this change, we are proposing to find that attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS are unlikely to be affected by changes to the burn decision timing.</p><p>Burn Approval Criteria</p><p>As under the 1998 SMP, the 2022 SMP has eight approval criteria. All eight were updated to include state or Federal air quality regulation citations, which improve clarity for both regulators and the regulated community as compared to the 1998 SMP, which did not include citations. There are no substantive changes to approval criteria 3, 4, 6, and 7. Washington revised approval criteria 2 to reflect the specific statutory language authorizing the condition and the corresponding citation.[14]</p><p>The most substantive changes are to approval criteria 1, 5, and 8. Under the 1998 SMP, approval criteria 1 considered whether there was a likelihood of an \"intrusion\" of visible smoke, whereas under the 2022 SMP, this criterion was revised to the likelihood of an exceedance of state air quality standards, which include the NAAQS, based on the requirement in RCW 70A.15.5140. The 2022 SMP also includes a new requirement for DNR and burners to monitor for and address intrusions of smoke due to silvicultural burning above 22.5 ug/m3 of PM2.5, a level significantly below the 35 ug/m3 PM2.5 NAAQS exceedance level. With this new requirement, combined with the revision to rely on the NAAQS exceedance level, criteria 1 is more protective in the 2022 SMP than the 1998 SMP. Approval criteria 5, previously a non-air quality specific reference to endangered species protections already in Washington State's Forest Practices Rule and Regulations, now prohibits burning in areas where Federal or State air quality standards are exceeded for any criteria pollutant, with limited exceptions for silvicultural burning to improve or maintain fire dependent ecosystems for rare plants or animals in specified areas. This is more protective than the existing criteria. Approval criteria 8 was revised by replacing language regarding smoke dispersion thresholds with criteria based on whether a declared stage of impaired air quality has been called or is likely to be called in the next 24 hours, based on coordination among DNR, Ecology, and local air agencies.[15] DNR still evaluates smoke dispersion under the 2022 SMP when assessing meteorological data, forecasting models, and permitting data to evaluate whether approval criteria 1, 2, and 3 have been met.[16] For these reasons, we are proposing to find that attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS are unlikely to be affected by the revisions to the eight approval criteria.</p><p>Summer Weekend Burning</p><p>The 1998 SMP contains a statewide prohibition on large burns from midnight Thursday through midnight Sunday between June 15 and October 1 and on the holidays of July Fourth and Labor Day. This prohibition is commonly referred to as the \"summer weekend burning prohibition.\" The summer weekend burning prohibition only applies to large burns under the 1998 SMP. Moreover, all prescribed burns are, and will continue to be, severely limited for much of the period covered by the 1998 SMP summer weekend burning prohibition regardless of size. This is because prescribed burns during this period are frequently limited due to high occurrences of inconducive weather, fuel conditions, preparedness levels and other safety constraints.[17]</p><p>Although the 2022 SMP does not retain the summer weekend burning prohibition, air quality protections are in place for the newly allowed burning because removing the prohibition only affects large burns, which require site-specific DNR smoke management decisions before ignition may occur.[18] The 2022 SMP requires DNR's smoke management decisions to be protective of air quality through the inclusion of the Approval Criteria for Large Burns and All Burns within UGAs. For these reasons, we are proposing to find that attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS are unlikely to be affected by removal of the summer weekend burning prohibition.</p><p>Burning in Urban Growth Areas</p><p>In 2019, the Washington State Legislature amended state law[19] to allow previously prohibited prescribed burning in urban growth areas. Unlike the summer weekend prohibition, the newly allowed burning is not burn size specific. The 2022 SMP includes allowances for prescribed \"Urban Growth Area (UGA) Burns\" and defines them as any \"fire that takes place wholly or in part within a UGA as defined by the county.\"[20] Regardless of consumable tonnage, urban growth area burns require a site-specific DNR smoke management decision, a documented test fire and a spot weather forecast.[21] This site-specific decision follows the same approval criteria used for making site-specific decisions for large burns. The criteria include requirements that approval to ignite be denied if there is a likelihood of an air quality standard exceedance, as well as other air quality considerations.[22] For these reasons, we are proposing to find that attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS are unlikely to be affected by the newly allowed urban growth area burning.</p><p>Regional Haze and Visibility</p><p>As discussed above, the 1998 SMP that is currently approved in the Washington SIP was approved as part of Washington's regional haze and visibility protection plan. 68 FR 34821 (June 11, 2003). EPA has recognized that prescribed fires conducted for the purpose of ecosystem health and public safety in accordance with basic smoke management practices are generally consistent with the goal of making reasonable progress toward natural visibility in mandatory class I areas because prescribed fires are most often conducted to improve ecosystem health and to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, both of which can result in net beneficial impacts on visibility.[23] EPA proposes to find that none of the substantive changes to Washington's SMP discussed above interfere with reasonable progress towards natural visibility in mandatory class I areas, as laid out in Washington's regional haze and visibility SIP. As under the 1998 SMP, approval to burn will be denied if burning will not protect the public welfare, preserve visibility, protect scenic, aesthetic, historic, and cultural values, and prevent air pollution problems that interfere with the enjoyment of life, property, or cultural attractions or if burning will not comply with the Federal Clean Air Act regarding visibility protection of Federal Class I Areas.</p><p>IV. EPA's Proposed Action</p><p>We have reviewed the submitted SIP revisions and propose to find that the revisions meet the requirements of the CAA for approval. Based on our review of Washington's demonstration, we propose to conclude that the revisions to Washington's SIP will not interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment, reasonable further progress, or any other applicable requirement of the CAA. Under CAA section 110(k), EPA is proposing to approve, and incorporate by reference, into the Washington SIP at 40 CFR part 52, subpart WW the following statutes and regulations in Appendix 7 to the 2022 SMP that provide the authority for implementation and enforcement of the plan, as well as the permits that authorize burning under the 2022 SMP:</p><p>- RCW 52.12.103, Burning Permits--Issuance--Contents (state effective March 27, 1984);</p><p>- RCW 52.12.104, Burning Permits--Duties of permittee (state effective March 27, 1984);</p><p>- RCW 76.04.005, Definitions.

Incorporation by Reference</p><p>In this document, EPA is proposing to include in a final rule, regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, EPA is proposing to incorporate by reference the provisions described in Section IV of this preamble. EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents generally available through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulations.gov\">https://www.regulations.gov</url> and at EPA Region 10 Office (please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more information).</p><p>VI. Statutory and Executive Orders Review</p><p>Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this proposed action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this proposed action:</p><p>- Is not a \"significant regulatory action\" subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011);</p><p>* Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);</p><p>* Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);</p><p>- Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);</p><p>- Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</p><p>- Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</p><p>- Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001);</p><p>- Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act; and</p><p>- Does not provide the EPA with the discretionary authority to address, as appropriate, disproportionate human health or environmental effects, using practicable and legally permissible methods, under Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).</p><p>The SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land in Washington except as specifically noted below and is also not approved to apply in any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000), nor will it impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law. Washington's SIP is approved to apply on non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation, also known as the 1873 Survey Area. Under the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, Congress explicitly provided state and local agencies in Washington authority over activities on non-trust lands within the 1873 Survey Area. Consistent with EPA policy, the EPA provided a consultation opportunity to potentially affected tribes in a letter dated May 24, 2022.</p><p>List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</p><p>- Environmental protection</p><p>- Air pollution control</p><p>- Incorporation by reference</p><p>- Intergovernmental relations</p><p>- Lead</p><p>- Nitrogen dioxide</p><p>- Ozone</p><p>- Particulate matter</p><p>- Reporting and recordkeeping requirements</p><p>- Sulfur oxides</p><p>- Volatile organic compounds</p><p>Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.</p><p>Dated: March 13, 2023.</p><p>Casey Sixkiller,</p><p>Regional Administrator, Region 10.</p><p>Footnotes</p><p>1.

Size limits, including seasonal and county specific limitations, are described in Washington Administrative Code 332-24-211.</p><p>4. WAC 332-24-205 applies to \"all burning regulated by the department\" and WAC 332-24-211 Specific rules for small fires not requiring a written burning permit. WAC 332-24-211 clarifies that the requirements contained therein are \"[i]n addition to WAC 332-24-205\" and sets forth the diameter and seasonal restrictions for so called \"rule burns.\"</p><p>5. \"Forest debris\" includes forest slash, chips, and any other vegetative residue resulting from activities on forestland. This definition is from RCW 76.04.005(9), which is included in Appendix 7 of the 2022 SMP.</p><p>6. WAC 332-24-201(4) requires a written permit for all burning other than \"rule burns\" which are outside the scope of the SMP. \"Rule Burns\" must meet all general rules in WAC 332-24-205 as well as specific additional conditions in WAC 332-24-211.</p><p>7. PM2.5 is fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.</p><p>8.

See EPA's 2019 Exceptional Events Guidance: Prescribed Fire on Wildland that May Influence Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations, page 20.</p><p>11. Washington states, and EPA agrees, that attainment and maintenance related to criteria pollutants other than PM and ozone are unlikely to be impacted by the changes to Washington's SMP. There are no nonattainment areas in Washington except for one sulfur dioxide nonattainment area that is small in area and encompasses an aluminum smelter facility and the area immediately adjacent to this facility. No discernible sulfur contributions to that area are expected to result from prescribed fire due to the low levels of sulfur in the woody biomass being burned.</p><p>12.
