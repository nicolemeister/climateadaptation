Protection of 20,5 Million Acres of Wild Bolivian Forest</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As part of its efforts to address global warming,Bluegrace Energystarted the Adopt a Forest campaign, with the main goal of protecting as much of the Bolivian forests as possible, as well as its local communities and biodiversity. \"The project has been so successful, that we now account for 20,5 million acres of Bolivian forests,\" says Julio Montenegro, Bluegrace Energy president for Latin American business.<br/>The first 11 million acres were negotiated in March through a collaboration agreement for the administration and certification of forest management plans for conservation and restoration.</p><p>The idea is simple \u2013 backed-up by those forest lands, Bluegrace Energy issues Carbon Bonds, which are then exchanged for cash funds. The new resources are strategically allocated to improve and develop the indigenous communities of the forests. This way, by adopting a forest Bluegrace Energy empowers the indigenous communities that can help keep the forests save, which will in turn help us all mitigate the global warming and protect the environment and its biodiversity.</p><p>2. Collaboration With CIDOB</p><p>In September this year, Bluegrace Energy signed an inter-institutional cooperation framework agreement withCIDOB(the Confederation of Nations and Indigenous Peoples of the Chaco, East and Amazon of Bolivia), which is constituted by the 34 indigenous peoples that inhabit the entire Lowlands region, that is, 7 of the 9 Departments that make up Bolivia (Santa Cruz, Pando, Tarija, Chuquisaca, Cochabamba Tropics and North of La Paz). As representatives of the different indigenous communities, CIDOB is the best suited to assist our team on designing the specifics of each of our projects.</p><p>CIDOB, whose accreditation is recorded in the election act of the Great National Assembly of Indigenous Nations and Peoples of Bolivia held in San Borja \u2013 Beni on March 14, 2021, is legally represented by Mr Justo Molina Barrancos, as President, and Mr Rosendo Alpiri Nomine, as Vice-President.</p><p>3. Food Deliveries To The Indigenous Communities</p><p>As part of our commitment to improve the living conditions of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia and improve their relation with the nature around them, Bluegrace Energy's strategy is both, short-term and long-term. Essentially, because we know it takes time for our ideas and projects to bring the desired benefits, we are committed to give additional support to the communities involved until that happens. And we do that in the form of deliveries via trucks that transport tonnes of food to be distributed among the indigenous families.</p><p>The first delivery of 2022 was in early May, with two food trucks loaded with supplies intended to feed 1,000 indigenous families in the Bolivian region of Bajo Isoso, which was followed by deliveries in San Antonio de Lomer\u00edo and Charagua.Bolivia has one of the highest levels of extreme poverty in Latin America, and indigenous people, who are the poorest and most vulnerable population in Bolivia, represent approximately 65% of the country's estimated 11.2 million people.</p><p>\"At least these families won't have to worry about food for a while,\" notes Mr Montenegro.</p><p>The next food delivery is being scheduled for the beginning of January 2023.</p><p>4. Meeting With Indigenous Communities' Representatives</p><p>Yesterday, 20th December, our team in Bolivia led by Montenegro and Nelson Pineda met with Rosendo Alpire (CIDOB vicepresident \u2013 Federation of Indigenous Peoples of the East, Chaco and Bolivian Amazonia), Marco Antonio Garc\u00eda Justiniano (Cacique CBI \u2013 Capitania del Bajo Isoso), Porfirio L\u00f3pez M\u00e9ndez (Second Cacique CBI \u2013 Capitania del Bajo Isoso), Juan Carlos Pesoa (President of Los Jaguares \u2013 indigenous firefighters group) and Diego Barbery (Vicepresident of Los Jaguares \u2013 indigenous firefighters group) in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, to discuss the status on the above mentioned points and to thank the Bluegrace Energy team for the hard work they have been doing in coordination with their representative authorities.</p><p>The representatives of each group acknowledged that Bluegrace Energy's ongoing projects involving the empowerment of these indigenous communities are of great magnitude and responsibility, and the procedures regarding the channeling of resources are extremely complicated and bureaucratic, limiting immensely their access to them. It is for this reason, that they do not only appreciate Bluegrace Energy's support but also put at our team's disposal all the tools and collaboration they can, both organic and political, to advance towards the common objective of the development and progress of their peoples.</p><p>5. Collaboration With Capitan\u00eda Del Bajo Isoso</p><p>For starters, our collaboration agreements with the indigenous region of Capitan\u00eda del Bajo Isoso have just been ratified by its representatives through a heartfelt letter that you can find in the media below, along with its translation into English.<br/>As you might still remember, this collaboration agreements focus on the administration and certification of this region's forest management plans for the conservation and restoration.</p><p>\"It is always pleasant to see that one's hard work is not for nothing, but that its objectives are being met\", commented Mr Montenegro. \"There is still a long path ahead in our collaboration with the indigenous peoples of the Capitan\u00eda del Bajo Isoso before we meet all our objectives but every single journey starts with that first step we took in March this year.\"</p><p>6. Collaboration With Los Jaguares</p><p>Back in May 2022, our Bluegrace Energy team in Bolivia, led by Montenegro, made a delivery of water at the headquarters of the forest fire brigade of Chiquitania \u2013 Los Jaguares, as part of our\"Adopt a Forest\" campaign. Los Jaguares are the forest's last line of defence against fire; its members are indigenous voluntaries who are willing to risk their lives to fight the numerous wildfires affecting the area every year, ever increasing in number as a result of climate change.</p><p>Recognising their crucial importance to protecting the Bolivian forests, Bluegrace Energy took a new step forward on their commitment to the indigenous communities by providing Los Jaguares with new and improved equipment, such as fireproof helmets, neck protectors, jackets, trousers, etc., and tools, such as axes, cameras, walkie talkies, water bags, etc.</p><p>In addition, Bluegrace Energy will also provide the resources required to carry out the first training programme to the new Los Jaguares voluntaries. To this end, we will be sending to their offices laptops and projectors.</p><p>\"We are proud with what we have achieved so far in Bolivia, for its peoples and its forests, and look forward to see what 2023 will bring for us all\" concluded Montenegro.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Julio Montenegro, Bluegrace Energy, 1 9726173,<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:j.montenegro@bluegraceholdings.com\">j.montenegro@bluegraceholdings.com</email></p><p>Twitter,LinkedIn,Facebook</p><p>SOURCE Bluegrace Energy</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=UN74011&amp;Transmission_Id=202212280830PR_NEWS_USPR_____UN74011&amp;DateId=20221228\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-UN7401120221228</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6765-FBD1-DXP3-R13P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1189\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now, those with extenuating circumstances can get a special permit from the town fire marshall.</p><p>Wanda Brooks, a resident who was among those the burn ban posed a hardship for, said the town board could have avoided the do-over by holding a public hearing. The town board passed the burn ban without any advance notice to the public that it was even being considered.</p><p>\"I appreciate them stepping back and taking a second look at the burn ban and coming up with a compromise,\" Brooks said. \"I hope they will remember this situation next time and allow us to speak prior to the decision being made.\"</p><p>To get a special exemption to the burn ban, the fire marshall will visit the property first to ensure the burning site meets protocols.</p><p>\"The fire marshal can approve burning of debris due to steep terrain or a circumstance that makes it impractical to carry it to the curb,\" Waynesville Fire Chief Joey Webb said. \"The pre-inspection allows us to educate folks on proper fire safety.\"</p><p>The inspection check list covers things like having water nearby, a raked area around the pile and being a safe distance from structures.</p><p>Town Manager Rob Hites pointed out that the forest fire in Maggie Valley in early April was started by someone burning debris from clearing. It burned 300 acres in less than 24 hours before rain put it out.</p><p>\"It can catch really quickly,\" Hites said.</p><p>Fires will only be permitted for small brush piles limited to five feet wide and tall.</p><p>\"We felt like having a smaller fire where you add a little bit at a time is safer,\" Hites said.</p><p>Burning of trees or large logs won't be allowed, either, due in part due to the volume of smoke big sections of tree trunks create.</p><p>\"It's not the burning that's the issue as much as the smoke,\" Webb said, citing the nuisance factor for neighbors.</p><p>Indeed, that's led to the new burning ban in the first place. Wholesale burning of trees by the Waynesville Inn and Golf Resort in connection with large-scale land clearing during the fall and winter blanketed part of town in smoke.</p><p>The burn ban doesn't apply to campfires or cooking fires, which allow larger logs.</p><p>\"If you are roasting marshmallows or sitting around a fire in a pit, you could use larger wood in that,\" Webb said.</p><p>Only yard debris \u2014 not trash, papers or building materials \u2014 can be burned in the state of North Carolina. Webb calls it the \"if-you-can't-grow-it-you-can't-burn-it\" motto.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

In this poignant, thought-provoking collection of stories, which Halloran calls fables, he weaves together sequential tales that reflect the impacts of two species-human and chimpanzee-on each other and on the small section of farmland and jungle that they occupy. Every action produces a reaction, and both species' worlds change from moment to moment. </p><p>While the author's stories are fictitious, they are inspired by his observations of the behavior of the Matamba and Mabureh chimpanzee communities during his years working with the Tonkolili Chimpanzee Project in Sierra Leone. These are augmented by the oral-history conversations he had with villagers. Although there are several tales that feature the villagers, the most compelling stories star several chimpanzees, whom Halloran has named. There's the darling, inquisitive Pip, a 3-year-old juvenile who is too young and small to survive without his mother, Mrs. Joe. And there's Magwitch, the powerful yet compassionate Matamba alpha male. The most heart-wrenching tale is \"The Inferno,\" concerning an out-of-control forest fire unwittingly started by villagers burning brush. As the flames engulf the woods and the chimpanzees flee to safety, Mrs. Joe and Pip become separated. Pip wanders the forest, frightened and pitifully crying out for his mother. Unexpectedly, Magwitch picks him up and assumes responsibility for watching over him. Halloran is more than a storyteller. He composes with a philosophical and poetic grace. Here, he describes the sunrise: \"The morning light passes over the individuals who have in our past, or will in our future, create the variables of our world. It passes over those we will help, those we will hurt, those we will use, those we will hate, and those we will love.\" A series of appendices supplements the fables with disturbing European colonial history events and their consequences for chimpanzees. A lovingly rendered, highly illuminating, and melancholy portrayal of an indelible group of chimpanzees.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2021-10-01</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Elgin Press</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>Fiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-1736649800</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$25.99</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Halloran, Andrew R.</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000220976</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645X-WKH1-JC8J-R02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 1, 2021, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001379</classCode><className>PRIMATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D9C7</classCode><className>MAMMALOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOE8</classCode><className>PRIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D5ID</classCode><className>ZOOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC557</classCode><className>SIERRA LEONE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As mentioned, we would like to welcome you to Major Drilling's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On the call, we will have Denis Larocque, President and CEO; and Ian Ross, our Chief Financial Officer. Our results were released yesterday evening and can be found on our website at www.majordrilling.com. We also invite you to visit our website for further information.</p><p>Before we get started, we'd like to caution you that during this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements about future events or the future financial performance of the company. These statements are forward-looking in nature and actual events or results may differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements.</p><p>I will now turn the presentation over to Denis Larocque. Please, go ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Chantal, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter as we continued to see steady growth month-by-month throughout the quarter. As expected, we saw increased activity from copper, lithium, silver and nickel customers, which helped offset the reduced demand from junior exploration companies as capital markets fundraising remains a challenge for some of those companies. Early in the summer, project delays due to permitting and forest fires impacted our North American operations. However, by the end of the quarter, we saw the return of strong activity levels. We were particularly pleased with the result from our South American and Australasian operations, which are seeing a pickup in activity that bodes well for the future.</p><p>The strong EBITDA generation, combined with our now completely debt-free position, allows us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders, as we initiated our share buyback program, executing on it at a very attractive level this quarter. Including these initiatives, we still ended the quarter with a net cash position of CAD60.8 million.</p><p>With that, Ian will walk us through the quarter's financials, and then I'll discuss the market outlook further. Ian?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Denis. Revenue for the quarter was CAD198.9 million, relatively flat from revenue of CAD199.8 million recorded in same quarter last year. Activity levels remained elevated despite some challenges in North America with forest fires and customer delays relating to permitting issues. The favorable foreign exchange translation impact on revenue and net earnings for the quarter, when comparing to the effective rates for the same period last year, was approximately CAD6 million and CAD1 million, respectively. The overall gross margin percentage, excluding depreciation, was 30.1% for the quarter, compared to 30.8% for the same period last year. We were able to maintain strong margin performance with inflation impacts continued to be covered by pricing adjustments in most markets. We are starting to see some stability with inflation in some of our direct costs as supply chains continue to improve.</p><p>G&amp;A costs were CAD16.5 million, an increase of CAD300,000, compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was driven by annual inflationary wage adjustments implemented at the start of the new fiscal year. Foreign exchange loss was CAD1.6 million compared to a loss of CAD700,000 for the same quarter last year. While the company's reporting currency is the Canadian dollar, various jurisdictions have net monetary assets or liabilities exposed to various other currencies. The company strives to limit its exposure to the Argentine peso, however, Argentina generated a significant portion of the loss during the current quarter as the currency faced continued devaluation.</p><p>The income tax provision for the quarter was CAD7.2 million compared to CAD7.3 million for the prior year period. The income tax expense for the quarter was impacted by lower utilization of previously unrecognized tax loss. Net earnings were CAD21.8 million, or CAD0.26 per share, for the quarter compared to net earnings of CAD24.2 million, or CAD0.29 per share, for the prior year quarter.</p><p>EBITDA is CAD40.3 million compared to CAD43.5 million in the prior year quarter. The operational leverage in our business model continues to deliver strong EBITDA results and we progressed through these elevated activity levels.</p><p>Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter in a very strong net cash position of CAD60.8 million. With the continued high interest rate environment, the company repaid the remaining CAD20 million of its long-term debt. The facility remains available to us, if needed, providing a tremendous competitive advantage and flexibility as we continue to focus the company on either organic or strategic M&amp;A growth opportunities. The company also took the opportunity at current valuations to make use of its normal course issuer bid, spending CAD1.3 million on share buybacks at an average price of CAD8.89 per share. We will continue to be opportunistic with our buyback plan with current valuations at historic lows.</p><p>We remain committed to reinvesting in the business by spending CAD16.3 million on capital expenditures, adding five new drill rigs and support equipment, while disposing of four older, less efficient rigs, bringing the total rig count to 601. The new breakdown of our fleet and utilization is as follows: 287 specialized drills at 46% utilization, 115 conventional drills at 49% utilization, 199 underground drills at 54% utilization, for a total of 601 drills at 49% utilization.</p><p>As we've mentioned before, specialized work in our definition is not necessarily conducted with a specialized drill. Rather, it is work that requires we meet the rigorous standards of our customers in terms of technical capabilities, operational and safety standards, and other related factors. These standards are becoming increasingly important to our customers. In the first quarter, revenue from specialized work accounted for 65% of our total revenue as we continue to see increased demand for our specialized services. Conventional drilling, which is mostly driven by juniors, made up 11% of our revenue for the quarter, while underground drilling revenue remained consistent at 24% of our total revenue.</p><p>Seniors and intermediates continue to drive our business, representing 76% of revenue this quarter as they value the high quality specialized services Major Drilling offers and remain committed to partnering on their drilling programs. With the continued challenges accessing capital, revenue derived from juniors remained constant from last quarter at 24%.</p><p>In terms of commodities, following on trends seen in previous quarters, there has been a shift to battery metals with copper, nickel, lithium, and silver projects combining for approximately 40% of our revenue. Gold, which historically represents 50% of our revenue, dropped to 41% this quarter, while iron ore contributed 11% of our revenue.</p><p>With that overview on our financial results, I'll now turn the presentation back to Denis to discuss the outlook.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Ian. As we move in our second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect to see the monthly growth that we experienced from the beginning of this calendar year to continue throughout the quarter. The need to replenish supply shortfalls on most metals remains a priority for mining companies despite the fluctuations we see in commodity prices. Those prices have remained well above the level needed to support exploration and we are already in discussion with several senior customers regarding their calendar 2024 program with many looking to book rigs early.</p><p>I think it's important to highlight the reasons why Major Drilling is extremely well-positioned for the future as the world continues to look to find new supplies of minerals to meet the growing demand in the world of electrification. First of all, Major Drilling is the leader in specialized drilling. Meaning, we are the go-to drilling company for many mining companies with technically challenging programs, whether it's remote, deep, high altitude, arctic, or directional. As a reminder, Major Drilling drilled the longest diamond drill hole ever drilled in Canada at the Osisko Mining Windfall project site in 2020. As well, the company is now a significant player in the underground services sector, growing our underground drilling revenue by 275% as compared to peak levels of 2012.</p><p>By being the largest pure-play drilling company in the industry, it gives us access to many technologies from our suppliers where we often become first adopters, which helps keep our leadership position in specialized drilling, but also as an innovative company in our industry. All of this wouldn't be possible without an experienced management team, which is the key to our success as this industry relies on expertise when faced with challenging projects.</p><p>Finally and importantly, financial discipline has permitted us to position ourselves as the -- with the strongest balance sheet in our industry, which allows us to have the resources ready to mobilize on some of the most demanding projects out there and maintain our position as both the operator and employer of choice in our industry. We are seeing more and more customers recognizing the impact of the higher quality of our services that can have -- on their overall drilling costs.</p><p>Completing each hole and safe production are more important to most of our customers than the pure price per meter as these items can make a huge difference on their drilling program, especially when dealing with a specialized project. That is why we are keeping our commitment to investing in the development of our people and investing in our fleet.</p><p>Looking forward, the global demand for electric vehicles continues to grow and will require an enormous amount of copper and battery metals, which will increase the pressure on the existing supply-demand dynamic. We expect all of this to lead to substantial additional investments in copper and other base metal exploration projects as we help our customers discover the metals that will allow the world to accelerate its effort towards a green economy. Many of the new mineral deposits in questions are located in areas challenging to access, requiring complex drilling solutions, and continued demand for specialized services.</p><p>Despite the urgent need to replenish mineral reserves, both for gold and base metal, the industry is still early in the exploration cycle. We are only in the third year of this cyclical upturn and the last upturn lasted 10 years. The mining industry is still in the discovery phase and we'll have to go to an intense multi-year infill drilling period to develop new mines in order to fill the projected supply gap in the different commodities.</p><p>With these fundamentals still firmly in place, the long-term outlook for our company remains extremely positive. Major Drilling remains in a unique position to react to and benefit from these market dynamics.</p><p>With that, we can open the call to questions. Operator?</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Gordon Lawson from Paradigm Capital. Please, go ahead. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Can you please provide some more color on the wildfires in terms of how many operations were affected and how much of these issues spilled into the current quarter?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, for us in the quarter, the wildfires weren't a huge impact in terms of number of projects. We had a few -- it was more of the permitting was probably the bigger impact on the quarter. Since then, the forest fires have subsided for us, our operations in Canada. We estimate approximately CAD5 million in revenue, or 5% of that region's revenue was impacted in Q1 versus permitting and forest fires combined.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Permitting specific to North America or are you also referencing Mexico there?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Mainly North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And one more, if I may. Are you able to break down your Mexican operations in terms of major versus junior as well as gold and silver?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>We don't go in that granular detail. But obviously, Mexico typically is gold- and silver-driven for the most part. That would be the majority of our revenue comes from that. And it's pretty much balanced between junior and senior. But the -- Mexico typically has a bit of a higher balance of junior projects typically than the rest of the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>So, you expect a bigger impact there to be the junior financing rather than the mining legislation, or is that too difficult to predict at this point?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Well, I mean, one leads to the other. It's going to make it probably a bit more difficult to raise money for juniors with the government. So, the juniors are going to be impacted from that. But as well, like you say, the financing -- overall financing issues are probably affecting Mexico a bit more than other regions, yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Ryan Hanley from Laurentian Bank. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, and good morning, Denis and Ian. Just a couple of quick ones for you on some of the regional operations, I guess, maybe to take a step further on the forest fires. Have you gotten any indications that maybe some of the juniors are looking to ramp up their programs heading into the end of the calendar year? Like, are there guys that might be looking to add another rig or two to try to get caught up a bit after some of the forest fire-related shutdowns?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>It's too early to tell at this point. There's the odd one here and there. Now is that going to be a trend? It's too early to tell at this point. But every year, it seems like you get to the fall and budgets that whether it's junior or senior, budgets that were not spent during the year tends to -- that's where sometimes you get the phone call in a panic and they want one or two more drills because they're behind on budget and they want to make sure the budget is spent before the end of the year. So, you do get that, but it's too early to tell at this point in terms -- because those typically happens in late September, October.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Makes sense. And then in South and Central America, obviously, Mexico is pretty challenging. But in some of the other countries in the region, I think there's been a few other elections, especially on the regional level lately. Has there been any other impact in any other countries down there where things have gotten a bit more challenging over the last, call it, three months to six months?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Well, the Mexico one that Gordon referenced the new law there, we're going to see what kind of impact that's going to have. The only other one that will be interesting to watch is Argentina. There's an election coming in October. Other than that, things are -- in our other markets, things are going well. In Chile, the -- I think the investment climate there has improved with a bit more certainty, or lessened uncertainty, I guess, around mining with things getting clarified and things put behind us on there. So, I think we're going to be -- things are going to be fine going forward in Latin America. Like I said, Argentina is the one where we're going to watch the election in October and see what kind of impact that might have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Lawson:</emphasis></p><p>Perfect. That's really helpful. Thanks. Maybe just quickly switching gears to the finance side. Can you remind me, on that contingent consideration, what period is that payable over? Or, what's the kind of time frame I should be looking at for that to be kind of wound down?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, there's one -- it was over three years, and the second year payout would be due in the second quarter coming up, and then one year from then is the last payout.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Got it. Perfect. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>And then the last one, because I'm guessing this is probably going to come up anyway because it does on those calls. But given the great cash flow generation, you've now got no long-term debt. I guess, you're kind of somewhat limited in buybacks because you don't want to hurt your liquidity too much. Any updates you can provide on potential dividend in the future?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>At this point, there's no plan of that. I mean, it's always something that is discussed internally. But at this point, there's no plan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Fair enough. That's it for me. Thanks, again, very much for taking my questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. And by the way, Ryan, that's because our focus is still on growth and we're still very positive on the future and the possibility. So, for us, we're still very much focused on growth and also what could come out over the next couple of years with, as I mentioned, we're just -- right now, it's just exploration for the most part, but there's going to be a lot of infill drilling to bring those projects and those -- to turn those into mines. So, we want to make sure that we're well positioned to take advantage of that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Well, congrats on the great quarter, and thanks, again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Ross:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions The next question is from Dennis Scannell from Rutabaga Capital. Please, go ahead. Your line is now open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Scannell:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. Good morning. Just a quick thing for me, looking at the segment information. So, Ian, I think you talked about permitting issues kind of hitting revenues by about CAD5 million, if I heard you correctly. We're still seeing a negative compare even if you add that back on the sales side. And I'm just wondering, is that reflective of just some lower activity by your customers or maybe some share loss to other operators? Just additional color on what's going on in North America. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. The bulk of that other piece that, as you mentioned is related really to juniors. There's a bigger -- especially early on in the cycle, the juniors are more present in the big markets, Canada, U.S. and Australia. And with the financing issues that basically those companies are facing, North America was more impacted, about four of the -- those junior projects. And in fact S&amp;P Global, I think, has mentioned that exploration globally, they were forecasting, I think, would be down 20% this year. And so -- and I think the bulk of that would be related to the lack of financing for juniors, which again impacts mostly North America.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis Scannell:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. Okay. So -- and just kind of thinking then comparisons start to get easier, what, in calendar '24 or just in terms of kind of your year-over-year comps just out of curiosity?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. It probably went with the drop because, we had a very good year in terms of junior. The junior -- see what -- junior financing, the juniors were able to raise money in late 2020 and 2021, which then fueled exploration projects by these companies in 2021 and 2022. So, that's where we saw a big uptick from juniors in those years. And now if the slowdown we're seeing right now, then -- so there's a bit of a reduction. So, yeah. So, when you go to 2024, things should be fairly stable. If everything remains the same, you're right, we -- then we should be on an even playing field, if I might say, in terms of comparisons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryan Hanley:</emphasis></p><p>Great. Thank you for the clarification.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. There is no further question registered at this time. I would like to turn back the meeting over to Mr. Larocque.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Larocque:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Please don't forget to join us for our AGM, which will be held virtually tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. And you can find the details on our website. So, hopefully, we talk to you tomorrow.</p><p>Thank you for listening.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Closing Remarks]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-756df4bdddca5c939228ec0a933df57d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB8-X6S3-RT89-S543-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 AlphaStreet Inc.

Doug LaMalfa, R-California, issued the following news release on Feb. 3, 2022:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yesterday the Congressional Western Caucus hosted a 2022 Kick-off Chairmen's Briefing to outline their goals and priorities for the Caucus in 2022. Chairman Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Senate Western Caucus Chairman Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), and other members of the Caucus discussed their policy priorities for the upcoming year. The Congressional Western Caucus is made up of over 60 Members who serve as the voice of rural America in Congress. Many of the Caucus's policy priorities for the upcoming year regard improvements in domestic energy policy, private property rights, water policy, forest revitalization, and farming and agriculture.</p><p>\"Farmers, ranchers, and rural areas depend on clean sources of water to survive. Unfortunately, 90% of western states faced catastrophic drought conditions in the last year. Our recent winter storms have shown that we have enough water, we just don't have the reservoir capability to store it. Looking at long term solutions, such as increased water storage, combats catastrophic drought and ensures that we have enough water come fire season. As us western states are all too familiar, many of our towns were hit hard by yet another devastating fire season. Last summer multiple fires scorched over two million acres in my district, destroying thousands of homes, businesses, and municipal facilities. To help alleviate some of the financial burdens and accelerate rebuilding, I made rebuilding our towns and managing our forests a top priority in 2021, and I plan to continue these efforts into this year,\" said Congressman LaMalfa.</p><p>\"Much of the west is federally-owned land and we need a far more aggressive approach in thinning our unmanaged, overgrown federal forests. California alone has an estimated 35 million tons of waste biomass available annually that sits on our forest floor, left to burn as fuel for wildfires and decompose in our forests. Converting natural waste biomass into biofuel is a win-win-win for energy production, forest fire curtailment, and job growth right here in our back yard. Rural America is the backbone of our country, and I am working to bring new economic and job opportunities to our rural towns. Our small towns and forested communities can't wait. We have been burning up at record rates the last few years. Western Caucus and rural representatives are committed to working to improve wildland management practices, forest regrowth, and helping survivors of wildfires rebuild.\"</p><p>Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California's First Congressional District, including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7735875 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7735875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64PD-WXR1-JC11-10T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>7:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 4, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

DEM is cosponsoring a tree planting Arbor Day Celebration on Friday, April 29, at 10:30 AM at Wilson Park in North Kingstown, along with the Town of North Kingstown, Rhode Island Tree Council, and National Grid. Trees play an important role in cooling streets and homes, filtering air, and sequestering carbon.</p><p>\"In all of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns, trees beautify our landscapes, provide cooling shade in the summer, and mitigate the effects of climate change,\" said Governor Dan McKee. \"This Arbor Day, I encourage Rhode Islanders to show their appreciation of trees by participating in community cleanups to Keep Rhody Litter Free.\"</p><p>\"Rhode Island's forests are marvels. They are the origin of much of our clean drinking water, purify our air, hold topsoil to prevent erosion, and provide habitat to hundreds of species of mammals, birds, and insects,\" said DEM Acting Director Terry Gray. \"From rural communities to our urban centers, trees improve and beautify almost every aspect of our lives. I'm grateful to take time on Arbor Day to appreciate their many benefits.\"</p><p>Each year, Arbor Day is celebrated on the last Friday of April to mark the importance of trees to the environment, culture, and economy. The first Arbor Day was celebrated in Nebraska in 1872 with more than a million tree plantings. Rhode Island began celebrating the day in 1887. In addition to Arbor Day, Rhode Island is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Clean Water Act this year and urge Rhode Islanders to take action to confront climate change and live more sustainably.</p><p>Rhode Island's 386,373 acres of forest protect drinking water, improve air quality, mitigate climate change, provide opportunities for outdoor recreation, promote health, harbor wildlife, and create economic value. They provide a \"sense of place\" to rural communities, suburbs, and cities alike and offer quiet solitude from a culture obsessed with screens and social media.</p><p>DEM's Division of Forest Environment and Agriculture works across the state with property owners and rural and urban communities on a wide range of forestry topics including forest heath, forest fire prevention, community tree planting, and private forest land management to maximize the positive benefits that forests bring to all Rhode Islanders. The division also manages 40,000 acres of state-owned rural forestland including the Arcadia and George Washington Management Areas, popular venues for outdoor recreation.</p><p>More than 50% of Rhode Island is forested, with most forest land owned by private citizens who face increased pressure to develop it for other uses. The most common forest health threats are from development or through fragmentation of large, forested parcels into smaller parcels, making sustainable forest management difficult. Healthy forests are essential to public health and well-being and form an important part of the state's natural infrastructure. From providing us with food to eat, paper for the books we read, and materials from which we build our homes and other products, forests have tremendous environmental, economic, and cultural benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125178995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65B2-V931-JCBF-S0NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 27, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from the University of Tasmania by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Uncontrolled wildfires in Australian temperate Eucalyptus forests produce significant smoke emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulates. Emissions from fires in these ecosystems, however, have received less research attention than the fires in North American conifer forests or frequently burned Australian tropical savannas.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Australian Research Council Linkage Program; Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre.<br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Tasmania: \"Here, we use the 2013 Forcett-Dunalley fire that caused the first recorded pyrocumulonimbus event in Tasmania, to understand CO2 and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions from a severe Eucalyptus forest fire. We investigate the spatial patterns of the two emissions using a fine scale mapping of vegetation and fire severity (50 m resolution), and utilising available emission factors suitable for Australian vegetation types. We compare the results with coarse-scale (28 km resolution) emissions estimates from Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) to determine the reliability of the global model in emissions estimation. The fine scale inventory yielded total CO2 emission of 1.125 \u00b1 0.232 Tg and PM2.5 emission of 0.022 \u00b1 0.006 Tg, representing a loss of 56 t CO2 ha-1 and 1 t PM2.5 ha-1. The CO2 emissions were comparable to GFED estimates, but GFED PM2.5 estimates were lower by a factor of three. This study highlights the reliability of GFED for CO2 but not PM2.5 for estimating emissions from Eucalyptus forest fires. Our fine scale and GFED estimates showed that the Forcett-Dunalley fire produced 30% of 2013 fire carbon emissions in Tasmania, and 26-36% of mean annual fire emissions for the State, representing a significant single source of emissions.\"<br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Our analyses highlight the need for improved PM2.5 emission factors specific to Australian vegetation, and better characterisation of fuel loads, particularly coarse fuel loads, to quantify wildfire particulate and greenhouse gas emissions more accurately. Current Australian carbon accountancy approach of excluding large wildfires from final GHG accounts likely exaggerates Tasmania's claim to carbon neutrality; we therefore recommend that planned and unplanned emissions are included in the final national and state greenhouse gas accounting to international conventions. Advancing these issues is important given the trajectory of more frequent large fires driven by anthropogenic climate change.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Carbon dioxide and particulate emissions from the 2013 Tasmanian firestorm: implications for Australian carbon accounting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Carbon Balance and Management</emphasis>, 2022,17(1):1-18.

Doug LaMalfa:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yesterday the Congressional Western Caucus hosted a 2022 Kick-off Chairmen's Briefing to outline their goals and priorities for the Caucus in 2022. Chairman Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Senate Western Caucus Chairman Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), and other members of the Caucus discussed their policy priorities for the upcoming year. The Congressional Western Caucus is made up of over 60 Members who serve as the voice of rural America in Congress. Many of the Caucus's policy priorities for the upcoming year regard improvements in domestic energy policy, private property rights, water policy, forest revitalization, and farming and agriculture.</p><p>\"Farmers, ranchers, and rural areas depend on clean sources of water to survive. Unfortunately, 90% of western states faced catastrophic drought conditions in the last year. Our recent winter storms have shown that we have enough water, we just don't have the reservoir capability to store it. Looking at long term solutions, such as increased water storage, combats catastrophic drought and ensures that we have enough water come fire season. As us western states are all too familiar, many of our towns were hit hard by yet another devastating fire season. Last summer multiple fires scorched over two million acres in my district, destroying thousands of homes, businesses, and municipal facilities. To help alleviate some of the financial burdens and accelerate rebuilding, I made rebuilding our towns and managing our forests a top priority in 2021, and I plan to continue these efforts into this year,\" said Congressman LaMalfa .</p><p>\"Much of the west is federally-owned land and we need a far more aggressive approach in thinning our unmanaged, overgrown federal forests. California alone has an estimated 35 million tons of waste biomass available annually that sits on our forest floor, left to burn as fuel for wildfires and decompose in our forests. Converting natural waste biomass into biofuel is a win-win-win for energy production, forest fire curtailment, and job growth right here in our back yard. Rural America is the backbone of our country, and I am working to bring new economic and job opportunities to our rural towns. Our small towns and forested communities can't wait. We have been burning up at record rates the last few years. Western Caucus and rural representatives are committed to working to improve wildland management practices, forest regrowth, and helping survivors of wildfires rebuild.\"</p><p>Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California's First Congressional District, including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124993537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64PF-WPB1-DYTH-G2T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 3, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Superintendent of schools Charles Tanous said that many children are kept out of schools because their families go blueberrying and then are out in the fields during potato harvest, but they do return to the Van Buren area in October.</p><p><br/>Madawaska Enrollment Set -- Madawaska schools opened their doors for the 1970-71 school year last Thursday and as of Friday, August 21, 1970, the total enrollment was 1904. A breakdown by individual schools was Evangeline, 250; Acadia, 399; Madawaska High School, including grades 7 and 8, 883; and St. Thomas School, 372. The 1970 enrollment of 1904 shows a decrease of 25 students from last year's total of 1929.</p><p><br/>25 Years Ago -- Aug. 30, 1995</p><p><br/>Pride Of Madawaska To March In Parade -- The Pride of Madawaska Marching Band will be the largest of the 15 bands that will participate in the Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the End of World War II Parade on Sept. 2, 1995 in Bangor. Sept. 2, 1945, was the day General Douglas MacArthur signed the World War II peace treaty aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The statewide anniversary celebration to honor Maine Veterans of all wars, has been three years in the planning by Galen Cole, founder of The Cole Land Transportation Museum in Bangor.</p><p><br/>Forest Fire Rousts Valley Residents -- A forest fire in Quebec had Valley heads of households out and about in the wee hours of the morning, checking for house fires. A spokesman for the state police said that \"A fire broke out in Quebec Province in the area of Three Rivers.\" Madawaska Police chief Ron Pelletier said that \"The police department and the fire department logged in more than 100 phone calls. Smoke stretched as far as Bangor.</p><p><br/>10 Years Ago -- Sept. 1, 2010</p><p><br/>Frenchville's New Boat Launch -- Contractors in Frenchville are working on a new, expansive boat launch into the St. John River with a total project cost of about $450,000, according to Frenchville Town Manager Phil Levesque.

Well, sort of it also includes a range of more vanilla possible projects such as case administration systems at AAT, upgrading radio communication for Forest Fire Management Fire Victoria staff - so perhaps it is not as large a cybersecurity spend as it first looks. <br/><br/>That said, to promote the effective use of these resources, the budget papers have shown that 50 government board members have been given cybersecurity training this year and more are set to receive the same training. <br/><br/>The newly allocated resources can be used to do things like: <br/><br/> supporting a centralized government content management system called the 'Single Digital Presence Platform' (which many government agencies are already using); <br/> introducing cybersecurity training, testing, and awareness programs; and <br/> improving Service Victoria's digital tools and cybersecurity; <br/><br/><br/>There is a lot of work still to be done in this area, but it is good to see an uptick in focus. <br/>Copyright 2021 K &amp;#38;

Yet Speaker Pelosi jammed through the \"Inflation Acceleration Act\" the other week that's a slush fund for Democrats' 'Green New Deal' agenda and hikes taxes on small businesses. Meanwhile, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas' self-inflicted border crisis rages on unabated at our southern border, with another 200,000 crossings in July a 300% increase since July 2020. However, the last few weeks of summer is also a reminder that there is hope for the future, as our children and grandchildren head back to the classroom. I extend well wishes to all the students, faculty, and staff of the school districts across the Sixth District. During these trying times, the people of western Virginia remain resilient, and as Congress is set to return this fall, I am preparing to continue to advance our interests in Washington.</p><p/><p>A Somber Remembrance: the Fall of Afghanistan</p><p>Against the advice of his generals, the Intelligence Community, and counter to the tactful withdrawal plan that President Trump negotiated, President Biden executed a haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan just one short year ago. One remembers the images: the Taliban inching closer to regaining control and imposing their deathly tyranny as Biden decided to pull out the troops first and abandon Bagram airbase, the desperate Afghan people clinging on to and falling off U.S. evacuation planes, terrorists closing in on Kabul eventually overrunning the capital, and the horrific deaths of 13 servicemembers, the deadliest attack on our troops in Afghanistan since 2011. Now the Taliban reign supreme in Afghanistan, with billions in left-behind military equipment and access to strategic airbases.</p><p>The fall of Afghanistan was a slap in the face to all who served and drew their last breath in defense of our Nation. This disastrous withdrawal and the weakness in the Oval Office has sent an emboldening message to dictatorial regimes around the globe and has made the world a more dangerous place.</p><p>The Biden Administration Crises Continue</p><p>The data from July sadly confirms what Americans already know: we're paying the price for Democrats' mismanagement of the country on multiple fronts. Inflation rose 8.5% in July. Compared to last year, the cost of meat is up 7.2%, eggs 38%, fish 8.7%, milk 15.6%, and the price of fruits and vegetables are up 9.3%. Worse yet, Democrats plunged the country further into the fiscal abyss as they jammed through the \"Inflation Acceleration Act,\" full of tax hikes for middle- and lower-income, hard-working Americans, 'Green New Deal' socialist handouts to rich environmentalists, and attacks on the oil and gas industry during a time of roughly $4 gas prices.</p><p>Source: Fox Business</p><p>At the southern border, July saw another 200,000 illegal migrant border crossings, bringing the total number of illegal crossings to over 2 million since October 1, 2021, including an estimated additional 500,000 \"got-aways\". When I visited the border Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was pleading for help from Congress, because the Administration's halting border wall construction, reinstating Catch and Release, and after hard-fought litigation, their final and permanent termination of Remain in Mexico were the matches that sparked this forest fire. The American people are fed up with these self-inflicted crises by the Biden Administration, and Republicans are ready to offer solutions and get our economy, security, and Nation back on track.</p><p>Back to School</p><p>Virginia is home to some of the best schools, dedicated teachers and parents, and motivated students in the country. To all the students, faculty, and staff of public schools, parochial schools, private schools, and homeschools that have already started their school years or will be kicking off soon, including Warren, Augusta, Rockbridge, Shenandoah, Amherst, Bath, Botetourt, Page, Roanoke, Rockingham, Highland, and Bedford Counties, and Waynesboro, Staunton, Buena Vista, Lexington, Harrisonburg, and Roanoke Cities, I wish you the best year yet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125430638</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66BH-DGG1-JCBF-S4V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 21, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You pass through a bed of shrimp and you can hear them. It sounds like a forest fire crackling.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Porpoises, whales and all manner of creatures, including humans hiding in submersibles, fill the ocean with sounds, according to Donahue.</p><p>He should know. Donahue spent four years listening to those sounds, including the echoes of Russian submarines below the ocean's surface, as a sonar operator on a Fletcher-class destroyer in the U.S. Navy in the 1950s.</p><p>Donahue, who serves as an honor guard with the American Legion Post 154, was named the city of Hayden's distinguished veteran of the year.</p><p>The honor guard is responsible for honoring U.S. military veterans at their funerals.</p><p>\"Mr. Donahue is well-deserving of this award and was chosen because of his many accomplishments while enlisted in the U.S. Navy and reserves, as well volunteering with American Legion Post 154 since moving to North Idaho,\" Hayden's recreation and events director Suzanne Cano said of Donahue's recent recognition at the city. \"We thank him for his selfless service to our community and country.\"</p><p>Donahue's travels in the Navy took him around the world, including the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and the South China Sea. His and his shipmate's job: Keep Russian submarines out of restricted areas.</p><p>Without modern technology, detecting submarines was a complicated operation aboard the destroyer that required multiple phone lines to communicate time, range and depth, Donahue said. Acoustics, ocean currents, even water temperature, come into play, he said.</p><p>It all starts in the \"sonar shack,\" a secretive work station where only Donahue, his team and certain officers were allowed. The sonar team used the pitch of echoes to determine the location and direction of potential submarines. Sonar operators like Donahue were able to determine this the same way an oncoming car's pitch changes as it gets closer to the listener.</p><p>That's where things get tricky. Those echoes can also come from a thick school of fish, seaweed, the ocean floor or other large objects in the water, he said.</p><p>When a submarine was detected, there was a shipwide call to battle stations.</p><p>\"One on one, the odds are 7-10 in favor of the submarine,\" Donahue said.</p><p>Submarines back then could detect ships much farther away than ships could detect them, he said. The submarines' goal was to stay hidden underwater.</p><p>\"If it can help it, the submarine won't waste a torpedo on a destroyer,\" Donahue said. \"They're after bigger targets. Carriers. Tankers. Ammunition ships. Troop ships. The carrier is probably the prime target.\"</p><p>Destroyers were expendable in anti-submarine warfare. If a torpedo was traveling toward a carrier, nearby destroyers were expected to act as a shield and take the hit instead.</p><p>Destroyers used depth charges, equipped with about 300 pounds of TNT, set to detonate at the approximate depth of the submarine.</p><p>\"You almost have to get a direct hit to destroy a submarine,\" Donahue said. More often, crews would disable the submarines \"to bring it to the surface and then you can use the 5-inch guns to destroy it. Or you ram it.\"</p><p>Donahue trained regularly for naval warfare aboard his ship, but said he never came into direct contact with enemy vessels. Instead, he was sent to patrol the Taiwan Straits to help provide safe passage for Chinese nationalists fleeing communist China for Taiwan in 1955.</p><p>\"We were standing wartime watches, four hours on, four hours off,\" he recalled. \"There were sometimes a week when I didn't make it to my rack, I would just sleep on the deck.\"</p><p>Originally, Donahue had planned to pursue a career as a doctor and began working full time in high school as an orderly at a hospital in his hometown of Glendive, Montana. After his mother died from cancer when he was still a teenager, he decided against the profession.</p><p>Instead, he took a job on an oil seismograph crew, which got his foot in the door as an \"electronic seaman recruit\" in the Navy.</p><p>Donahue took on a number of other jobs after the Navy, including roughneck on oil rigs in Montana and Wyoming, and as a steel mill worker in Chicago, before ultimately finishing school at the University of Montana and moving to Southern California to work as an auditor.</p><p>Donahue also took up a hobby as a race car driver with the Shelby Motorsports team until he was 66. He even took up a career later in life as an actor, doing voice work, commercials and appearing in more than a dozen episodes of \"Star Trek\" as an extra.</p><p>After more than 50 years of marriage, Donahue's wife, Patricia, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014. The two moved to North Idaho that year.

They were truly majestic - I felt a little closer to heaven.<br/>Thanks to an unusually cold spring, the Rockies were still snow-capped and glistening. \u00a0It was also that time of the year when the wildlife was out and about, enjoying nature's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pacificresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Itchon-Blog-Canada-060722-300x225.jpg\">Link to Image</url>bounty.\u00a0 I've never seen a bear in the wild, but on this trip I actually saw six, including a Grizzley and her cub.\u00a0 Big horn sheep, mountain goats, and bald eagles abound.\u00a0 Against all this was a backdrop of trees, trees, and more trees - I counted about a gazillion. \u00a0The endless miles of green inspired me to look into Canada's wildfire prevention efforts. \u00a0After all, they must be doing something right.</p><p><br/>But after some reading, it shouldn't have surprised me that much like California, Canada's wildfire policies are driven more by climate change, rather than serious, practical efforts to reduce wildfire risks.<br/>Fraser Institute Senior Fellow Robert Murphy, who has also authored several PRI studies, noted that in Canadian Pres. Trudeau's latest federal\u00a0budget, he proposes $129 million to help contain potential wildfires, stating that: \"Climate change is causing wildfires to become more frequent and more severe across Canada.\" \u00a0But Murphy, in some good old-fashion data collecting, showed that the government's own numbers reveal that forest fire severity has actually been declining over the past 30 years. Murphy writes, \"The plan for additional spending on wildfires may or may not be a good idea, but Canadians shouldn't be influenced by claims about climate change that are contrary to fact.\"<br/>In Murphy's 2020\u00a0study, and based on data from the Canadian National Fire Database, the last 30 years actually saw a downward trend in annual forest fires, whether measured in the number of fires or hectares burned. A ranking of Canadian forest fires in terms of total hectares burned showed that over the entire data set (ranging from 1959 to 2019), the six worst years all occurred prior to 2000.<br/>Murphy does make clear in his study that British Columbia, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories have experienced historically high fire activity in recent years. But he found that the increased fire activity in these three regions is more than counterbalanced by declines elsewhere. \u00a0He concludes: \"As these statistics make clear, the government's own numbers do not support casual statements about the increasing frequency and severity of Canadian wildfires.<br/>PRI's own board member, Judge Dan Kolkey, has made similar arguments when it comes to California's wildfire policies. In his chapter in Saving California (Pacific Research Institute, 2021), he writes that instead of focusing on new strategies to help control the state's wildfire risk, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that California needs to get more \"aggressive\" in achieving its target of 100 percent green electricity and that the target date of 2045 is \"too late.\" \u00a0Newsom wants to \"fast track all of these efforts,\" including investing in green energy and \"getting more electric cars on the road.\"<br/>But as Judge Kolkey reminds us, California only accounts for roughly 1 percent of global emissions.\u00a0 Consequently, \"there is no guarantee that the state's ambitious climate change policy is going to have any effect on arresting climate change, let alone reduce the risk of wildfires,\" he writes. Instead, Judge Kolkey makes some serious and practical recommendations that would go a long way in reducing wildfire risks, including thinning forests, hardening homes, and strengthening California's energy infrastructure.<br/>California's and Canada's attempt to thwart climate change through wildfire policies is misplaced at best, and potentially dangerous at worst.<br/>Rowena Itchon is senior vice president of the Pacific Research Institute.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The post Oh Canada!

Near the small town of Coffee Springs, Colorado, is the Diamond Bar, Kade Logan's 19,000-acre cattle ranch. Eight years ago, someone murdered Kade's wife, Heather, and though she was frequently unfaithful to him, Kade still wants to find and punish her killer. </p><p>So he hires undercover Denver agent Ellie Bowman, though he really didn't want a woman, to get him the answers he needs, and Ellie, who was brought up on a ranch, goes undercover to work as his cook's assistant. The first part of the book is more about the protagonists' increasing attraction than the unraveling of a mystery, but Martin seems to know her way around a working ranch, and she fills her romance with an interesting tutorial on what a well-run ranch does battle with each day. As Ellie investigates Heather's murder, a trespasser begins to sabotage the ranch: poisoning the water, killing cattle, wounding cowboys, shooting the beloved dog. As Ellie tries to figure out who hates Kade, she also gets into the saddle to help with ranch emergencies, rounding up 4,000 cows and fighting a forest fire. And as she moves into Kade's four-poster bed for the kind of wild, satisfying sex she's never known before, Ellie shows him gentle kindnesses he's never known, either. Martin repeatedly explains their conflict: Kade doesn't want to be hurt again, and independent Ellie doesn't want a possessive lover who doesn't trust her loyalty. But after Ellie's life is threatened and the murderer gets his just deserts, they find a way to work it out, with a ranch wedding Blake Shelton would have enjoyed. The title, oddly, has nothing to do with the book, but the romance is familiar.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publication Date: </emphasis>2021-10-26</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher: </emphasis>Kensington</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stage: </emphasis>Fiction</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISBN: </emphasis>978-1-4967-3679-6</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Price: </emphasis>$26.00</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Author: </emphasis>Martin, Kat</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIRKUS-2000219247</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIRKUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63TW-SHD1-JC8J-R0TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Kirkus Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kirkus Reviews (Print)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30101\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 15, 2021, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001830</classCode><className>WEDDINGS &amp; ENGAGEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112111MM</classCode><className>BEEF CATTLE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112100CC</classCode><className>CATTLE RANCHING &amp; FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX545</classCode><className>DENVER, CO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS121</classCode><className>COLORADO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Not pictured are Jules Janick and Max Judge. (Purdue UniversityAgricultural Communications photo)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Eight leaders from across the fields of agriculture were recognized with the Purdue Agricultural Alumni Association's highest honor&amp;#8239;- the Certificate of Distinction -during the Ag Alumni Fish Fry in April.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Certificate of Distinction is presented annually to professionals who have contributed to agriculture, forestry or natural resources through career accomplishments, organizational involvement, community service and other activities.</p><p>The following individuals were honored this year.</p><p>Stephen W. Creech, Bloomington, Indiana, earned a bachelor's degree in forestry and natural resources in 1974 from Purdue. A year later, he was a district forester with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and a volunteer firefighter in Greencastle. Part of an Indiana wildland fire crew since 1977, he's been mobilized nationally to 14 states since 1987 and has responded to hurricanes, floods and 9/11.</p><p>Creech has served on a Type 1 national incident management team since 1996, was Indiana's fire coordinator from 1978 to 2003, and is a two-time recipient of the Northeast Forest Fire Supervisors award. Creech was a primary force in establishing the Big Rivers Forest Fire Management Compact (Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, U.S. Forest Service), and is the current grants administrator. Working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and Indiana University, he helped initiate a geographic information system analysis of the wildland-urban interface fire problem in 20 northeastern states.</p><p>For two decades, Creech was an adjunct instructor for FNR's fire ecology class, and for years directed the department's forestry summer practicum in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He now heads Bloomington-based Wildfire Management and Training Specialists.</p><p>Byron Fagg, Salem, Indiana, has been Purdue Extension director and ANR educator in Washington County for 22 years. Fagg was instrumental in getting many programs started, with the Indiana Beef Evaluation Program, Bull Test Station, being a good example.</p><p>In 1983, Fagg started an annual breeding soundness evaluation (BSE) clinic in Washington County and then in six other counties. He determined that each bull identified as unable to breed cows cost the producer $10,000. Washington County producers have avoided more than $1 million in potential losses by identifying these bulls.</p><p>Fagg earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Purdue in animal sciences.</p><p>\"Each day I strive to be like Bryon,\" said Danielle Howell-Walker, a Purdue Extension Washington County educator, said. \"To build relationships with farmers, to be a positive leader, to respond quickly and accurately with information for those who need Extension assistance, to provide practical and applicable information during education programs and to promote agriculture and our county in the best light possible.</p><p>Jules Janick, West Lafayette, Indiana,came to Purdue in 1951. He has contributed iconographic studies on Dioscorides, the Drake Manuscript, the Unicorn Tapestries, Caravaggio, Cotan, and the Raphael frescoes in the Villa Farnesina in Rome. He has written on the inter-relationship of horticulture and scholarship, art, ethics and the contributions of horticulture to human welfare. More recently, he has contributed to unraveling the Voynich codex.</p><p>His scholarly work in plants led to the release of 23 varieties of disease-resistant apples. He has authored, co-authored or edited 142 volumes of books, journals or proceedings, 63 book chapters and 222 refereed journal articles. His seminal text, Horticultural Science, first published in 1964, is translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic and Hindi. Janick taught online for more than a decade, and two courses - History of Horticulture, and Tropical Horticulture - were taken by at least 6,000 students.</p><p>Max Judge, Lexington, Virginia, earned two degrees from Purdue and was a full professor at the university for 27 years. He developed and taught the first meat science course offered at Purdue. Thousands of Boilermakers have taken the course and others he developed. In 1974, he co-authored \"Principles of Meat Science,\" which, after updates, still is one of the most-used undergraduate meat science textbooks.</p><p>Judge's research led to improved meat quality with reduced fat content in pork. He published the first report in the United States indicating a definite effect of growing environment on swine meat quality. Judge demonstrated technology to measure swine carcass lean content on the production line in pork harvest plants. The Lean Team, funded by the USDA and the Indiana Pork Producers Association, received the USDA's Distinguished Service Award for Scientific Research in 1992. The American Meat Science Association's highest honor, the R.C.

Kladivko was instrumental in starting, funding and leading the Midwest Cover Crop Council and the Conservation Cropping Systems Initiative.

Fire!'\" said Samir Boundad, from Larache. <br/>\"We ran out to flee and fortunately, thanks to God, the fire moved up the mountain.\" <br/>A village in the Ksar El Kebir region was destroyed by the flames. <br/> People evacuate a house as a wild forest fire rages in northern Morocco Photo: AFP / FADEL SENNA  <br/>Hundreds of civil defence workers, as well as soldiers and police officers, are trying to stop the fires from causing more destruction. <br/>In four provinces -- Larache, Ouezzane, Tetouan and Taza -- the fires ripped through forestland that is difficult to access, said Fouad Assali, head of the National Center for Forest Climate Risk Management. <br/> Planes dropped loads of water to extinguish fires tearing through Morroco's terrain Photo: AFP / FADEL SENNA  <br/>\"Efforts are continuing in the hope of bringing these fires under control,\" Assali was quoted as saying by the official MAP news agency. <br/>Since Wednesday night, at least 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of forest have burned in Larache and Ouezzane, according to initial reports, leaving burnt trees smouldering under a sky blanketed by plumes of smoke. <br/>The North African nation, which is struggling under intense droughts, has in recent days been hit by soaring temperatures approaching 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). <br/>\"It is the heat that causes this kind of fire. It was yesterday at dawn that the fire reached our village,\" Ahmed Mezouar, 58, a resident of Larache, told AFP, adding that he was hopeful that firefighters would be able to contain it. <br/>Still, he worried, as a neighbouring village had been completely surrounded by the flames. <br/>\"We are afraid for our houses,\" he said. \"For the moment, we are safe.\" <br/>Across the Strait of Gibraltar, wildfires are also raging in southern Europe, from Portugal and Spain through to France and Greece. <br/>Scientists say extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts, which make wildfires more likely, are linked to climate change. <br/>They are expected to become even more frequent, more prolonged and more intense in the future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

This is to reduce hazardous fuels, improve critical winter habitat for mule deer and watershed restoration. This project is being implemented in partnership with Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Total project area in all locations will be 2,606 acres. The thinning will begin the week of October 13th and will be completed before spring of 2022.</p><p>Hand crews will lop and scatter the juniper on site which can be collected for firewood with a permit from the Logan Ranger District office.</p><p>By using a mechanical treatment to selectively thin juniper stands it will reduce hazardous fuels and encourage growth of forbs, grasses, and shrubs. This will also maintain beneficial shrub cover and perennial grasses in the treatment area, increase soil moisture during the growing season, which can be captured by grasses and flowering plants like forbs as they grow to re-claim and diversify the site, and will help improve big game winter and summer habitats. Action taken now will help maintain these habitats for the future. Similar projects will be completed this year in Lefthand Fork, Blacksmith Fork and in areas along the Ant Flat road. This type of project will be implemented in Logan Canyon over the next few years.</p><p>In the last seven years, 12,000 acres of hazardous fuels reduction projects were completed in Blacksmith Fork, Temple Fork, Green Canyon, and Providence Canyon.</p><p>For more information contact the Logan Ranger District office at 435-755-3620.</p><p>Map showing the areas that Juniper is being cut</p><p>*Map(s) omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/uwcnf/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD961587\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/uwcnf/news-events/?cid=FSEPRD961587</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR3945402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63VR-MPP1-JDKC-R03G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"351\"/><timeReceived>2:59 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 HT Media Ltd.

He developed and taught the first meat science course offered at Purdue. Thousands of Boilermakers have taken the course and others he developed. In 1974, he co-authored \"Principles of Meat Science,\"   which, after updates, still is one of the most-used undergraduate meat science textbooks.<br/><br/>Judge's research led to improved meat quality with reduced fat content in pork. He published the first report in the United States indicating a definite effect of growing environment on swine meat quality. Judge demonstrated technology to measure swine carcass lean content on the production line in pork harvest plants. The Lean Team, funded by the USDA and the Indiana Pork Producers Association, received the USDA's Distinguished Service Award for Scientific Research in 1992. The American Meat Science Association's highest honor, the R.C. Pollock Award, is another on a long list of national and international salutes.<br/><br/>Byron Fagg, Salem, Indiana, has been Purdue Extension director and ANR educator in Washington County for 22 years. Fagg was instrumental in getting many programs started, with the Indiana Beef Evaluation Program, Bull Test Station, being a good example.<br/><br/>In 1983, Fagg started an annual breeding soundness evaluation   clinic in Washington County and then in six other counties. He determined that each bull identified as unable to breed cows cost the producer $10,000. Washington County producers have avoided more than $1 million in potential losses by identifying these bulls.<br/><br/>Fagg earned bachelor's and master\u2019s degrees from Purdue in animal sciences.<br/><br/>\"Each day I strive to be like Bryon,\" says Danielle Howell-Walker, a Purdue Extension Washington County educator. \"To build relationships with farmers, to be a positive leader, to respond quickly and accurately with information for those who need Extension assistance, to provide practical and applicable information during education programs and to promote agriculture and our county in the best light possible.\"<br/><br/>Michael A. Veenhuizen, Greenwood, Indiana, is president of Livestock Engineering Solutions Inc., earning a national reputation while providing site planning, design expertise and professional consultancy for all aspects of manure handling.<br/><br/>Malcom DeKryger, president and CEO of Belstra Milling Co. and Belstra Group Farms and a trustee of Purdue, said that in the more than two decades he has worked with Veenhuizen, his integrity about doing the right thing is one of the greatest compliments he could give.<br/><br/>\"A livestock producer is faced with many challenges on an annual/seasonal/daily basis. Mike's understanding of the crossroads between design, construction, operation and compliance prevented many problems and raised the professionalism of Indiana's producers,\"   DeKryger says. \"We always knew that if anyone questioned our design by Mike that he would stand alongside and defend our dreams with intelligence\u202fand integrity.\"<br/><br/>Kevin Still, Avon, Indiana, is the former general manager of Pulaski County Co-op. He was president and chief executive of Midland Co-op from 1989 to 2002 and engineered a series of mergers and consolidations that created Co-Alliance, which Still has led since 2002.<br/><br/>A billion-dollar corporation and one of the nation's larger farmer-owned input supply cooperatives, Co-Alliance is based in Avon and has more than 1,000 employees and 80-plus locations in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. It deals in energy, agronomy, grain marketing and swine/animal nutrition.<br/><br/>\"Early on, Kevin realized that farmer-owned cooperatives were going to need to adapt and grow if they were to remain competitive in a rapidly changing agricultural business environment,\"   Purdue Provost Jay Akridge says. \"Change was essential if these farmer-owned businesses were to continue to provide the benefits to farmers that they had made possible for decades.\"<br/><br/>Stephen W. Creech, Bloomington, Indiana, earned a bachelor's degree in forestry and natural resources in 1974 from Purdue. A year later, he was a district forester with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and a volunteer firefighter in Greencastle. Part of an Indiana wildland fire crew since 1977, he\u2019s been mobilized nationally to 14 states since 1987 and has responded to hurricanes, floods and 9/11.<br/><br/>Creech has served on a Type 1 national incident management team since 1996, was Indiana\u2019s fire coordinator from 1978 to 2003, and is a two-time recipient of the Northeast Forest Fire Supervisors award. Creech was a primary force in establishing the Big Rivers Forest Fire Management Compact (Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, U.S. Forest Service), and is the current grants administrator. Working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and Indiana University, he helped initiate a geographic information system analysis of the wildland-urban interface fire problem in 20 northeastern states.<br/><br/>For two decades, Creech was an adjunct instructor for FNR\u2019s fire ecology class, and for years directed the department\u2019s forestry summer practicum in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. He now heads Bloomington-based Wildfire Management and Training Specialists.<br/><br/>Jules Janick, West Lafayette, Indiana, came to Purdue in 1951. He has contributed iconographic studies on Dioscorides, the Drake Manuscript, the Unicorn Tapestries, Caravaggio, Cotan   and the Raphael frescoes in the Villa Farnesina in Rome. He has written on the inter-relationship of horticulture and scholarship, art, ethics and the contributions of horticulture to human welfare. More recently, he has contributed to unraveling the Voynich codex.<br/><br/>His scholarly work in plants led to the release of 23 varieties of disease-resistant apples. He has authored, co-authored or edited 142 volumes of books, journals or proceedings, 63 book chapters and 222 refereed journal articles. His seminal text, Horticultural Science, first published in 1964, is translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic and Hindi. Janick taught online for more than a decade, and two courses \u2014 History of Horticulture, and Tropical Horticulture \u2014 were taken by at least 6,000 students.<br/><br/>Eileen Kladivko, West Lafayette, Indiana, the 2020-21 recipient of Purdue's prestigious Corinne Alexander Spirit of the Land-Grant Mission Award, is \"a generous scientist, still curious about new insights and applications,\" says Jennifer Tank, a professor at the University of Notre Dame.<br/><br/>In 1982, Kladivko became the first female faculty member in Purdue\u2019s Department of Agronomy.<br/><br/>Kladivko helped lead two significant changes in agriculture: the use of cover crops as a technique to reduce farm field nutrient losses and soil erosion, and the use of soil health to improve the understanding of soil systems management. Kladivko was instrumental in starting, funding and leading the Midwest Cover Crop Council and the Conservation Cropping Systems Initiative. More than 90,000 copies of the Cover Crop Pocket Guide that she authored are in circulation.<br/><br/>Julia Wickard, Greenfield, Indiana, is the current Indiana state executive director of the USDA Farm Service Agency. This is Wickard's second time filling this role, as she previously held the position from 2009-17, administering credit, disaster and safety net farm programs for agricultural producers and overseeing more than 345 employees in 75 field offices.   <br/><br/>In 2017, Wickard was the assistant commissioner at the Office of Program Support in the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. She was also the agricultural liaison. Wickard worked for U.S. and Indiana departments of agriculture, the Indiana Beef Cattle Association   and Indiana Farm Bureau Inc.<br/><br/>Source: Purdue University, which   is solely responsible for the information provided, and wholly owns the information.

Lawyers for his family want to know if negligence about his size, or other factors, played a role.</p><p>\"This young man, he was athletic and he was big. He had no way of knowing,\" said Bob Hilliard, a Texas attorney who represents Tyre's mother, Nekia Dodd, in an interview Saturday. \"This is going to be an issue of a lack of supervision and lack of training. A straight-up negligence case.\"</p><p>Investigators Saturday continued to examine what happened Thursday night when Tyre dropped out of his seat from a 430-foot, free-fall amusement park ride that is taller than the Statue of Liberty along a busy street in the heart of Orlando's tourist district not far from Disney World.</p><p>The ride takes patrons up to that height, tilts so they face the ground for a moment or two, and then plummets toward the ground at speeds of 75 mph or more.</p><p>Saudi airstrikes hit Yemen's Houthis</p><p>A Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen unleashed a barrage of airstrikes on the capital and a strategic Red Sea city, officials said Saturday. At least eight people were killed.</p><p>The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida - both held by the Houthis - came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jiddah, their highest-profile assault yet on the kingdom.</p><p>Brig.

In the village of Bemposta, residents used garden hoses to spray their lawns and roofs in hopes they could save them from the raging wall of red flames that approached through the wooden hills late Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cIt began spreading towards that way, the wind was blowing that way towards the mountain,\u201d said 88-year-old Antonio Carmo Pereira, while pointing to the flames on the outskirts of his village. \u201cIn a few minutes I couldn\u2019t see anything, just smoke.\"</p><p>\u201c(It\u2019s) dangerous, yes. It\u2019s surrounding all the houses,\u201d he said. \u201cI am afraid, but where can I go? Jump into a water tank? Let me stay here and look.\u201d</p><p>More than 800 firefighters were still fighting blazes in the Leiria district, where Bemposta is located, on Thursday.</p><p>Temperatures in the interior of the Atlantic country were forecast to hit 44 C (111 F) as hot, dry air blown in from Africa lingers over the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula. In June, 96% of Portugal was classified as being in either in \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d drought.</p><p>The hot air and parched ground, combined with strong winds, has created the perfect cocktail for severe wildfires.</p><p>Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa's government on Thursday extended a state of alert for wildfires until Sunday due to high temperatures. The week-long alert was originally to run until Friday. The Portuguese government has temporarily barred public access to forests deemed to be at special risk, banned the use of farm machinery and outlawed fireworks.</p><p>Costa said firefighters had to respond to 200 different blazes Wednesday and pleaded for his fellow citizens to take extra care when in the countryside.</p><p>\u201cMore than ever, we are the ones who must be extremely careful,\u201d Costa said. \u201cFrom a small act of carelessness a great tragedy can be born.\u201d</p><p>About 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) have been scorched this week in Portugal, according to the Civil Protection Agency. About 865 people had to evacuate their homes over the past week, although many had returned by Thursday. More than 30 homes and other buildings have been damaged.</p><p>Civil Protection commander Andr\u00e9 Fernandes said 160 people, including at least 70 firefighters, have been injured so far, but there are no confirmed fatalities from the fires in Portugal. Four people, including two firefighters, were seriously injured. Portugal has improved its fire safety since <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-ap-top-news-fires-international-news-portugal-24ed9af2c6574cb1aba9025796cdc4f1\">wildfires killed more than 100 people in 2017.</url></p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-wildfires-fires-italy-natural-disasters-dd0c50d724cdc545dc1002ad3de25351\">European Union has urged member states to prepare for wildfires</url> this summer as the continent faces another extreme weather shift that scientists say is being triggered by climate change.</p><p>In central Hungary, firefighters discovered a body Thursday where a small forest fire had burned overnight. It was found buried under the collapsed roof of a burned farmhouse near the village of Soltszentimre.</p><p>Spain was still combating a fire started by a lightning strike on Monday in the west-central Las Hurdes area that has consumed about 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres). Temperatures in many parts of Spain have been topping the 40 C (104 F) mark for several days and are expected to stay high until next week.</p><p>In France, two fires raged out of control in the region around Bordeaux in southwest France for a third consecutive day, despite the efforts of 1,000 firefighters and water-dumping planes to contain them.</p><p>The fires have destroyed more than 3,850 hectares (9,500 acres) of forest and grassland, the regional emergency said. It said firefighters struggled to contain the fire because of high winds and the difficulty of accessing the heart of the fires. More than 6,000 people have been evacuated from French campgrounds and villages in recent days.</p><p>___</p><p>Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.

The interior ministry said that one person has died in the fires, and more than 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of forest have been destroyed. <br/>In the Laarach area, 1,100 families have had to evacuate because of two fires that have since been put out. The fire destroyed 900 hectares (more than 2,000 acres) of land and damaged many homes, according to the interior ministry. <br/>Firefighters were still trying to put out fires in several areas of northern Morocco on Friday. They are using trucks, bulldozers and water-dumping planes, the interior ministry said. <br/>Fire-fighting planes drop water to put out a forest blaze in Laarach [AP Photo] <br/>In four provinces - Larache, Ouezzane, Tetouan and Taza - the fires ripped through forestland that is difficult to access, said Fouad Assali, head of the National Centre for Forest Climate Risk Management. <br/>'Efforts are continuing in the hope of bringing these fires under control,' Assali was quoted as saying by the official MAP news agency. <br/>Morocco has been in the grip of a heatwave for a week, with temperatures soaring above 40C (104F). Strong winds are in the forecast for the coming days, complicating efforts to contain fires, according to the national meteorology agency. <br/>Several villages that were evacuated also saw military planes dropping loads of water to extinguish fires tearing across the dry terrain, an AFP journalist said. <br/>Shocked by how fast the flames were spreading, residents fled their homes, with some families herding their cattle and horses - upon which their livelihoods depend - ahead of them. <br/>'I was with my family, and at one point, we heard people shouting, 'Fire! Fire!'' said Samir Boundad, from Larache. <br/>'We ran out to flee and fortunately, thanks to God, the fire moved up the mountain.' <br/>Evacuated people look on as they stand next to a vehicle while, behind, a wild forest fire rages near the Moroccan city of Ksar el-Kebir in the Larache region [Fadel Senna/AFP] <br/>A village in the Ksar el-Kebir region was destroyed by the flames. <br/>Across the Strait of Gibraltar, wildfires are also raging in southern Europe, from Portugal and Spain through to France and Greece. <br/>Scientists have said extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts, which make wildfires more likely, are linked to climate change. <br/>They are expected to become even more frequent, more prolonged and more intense in the future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

In the village of Bemposta, residents used garden hoses to spray their lawns and roofs in hopes they could save them from the raging wall of red flames that approached through the wooden hills late Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt began spreading towards that way, the wind was blowing that way towards the mountain,\u201d said 88-year-old Antonio Carmo Pereira, while pointing to the flames on the outskirts of his village. \u201cIn a few minutes I couldn\u2019t see anything, just smoke.\"</p><p>\u201c(It\u2019s) dangerous, yes. It\u2019s surrounding all the houses,\u201d he said. \u201cI am afraid, but where can I go? Jump into a water tank? Let me stay here and look.\u201d</p><p>More than 800 firefighters were still fighting blazes in the Leiria district, where Bemposta is located, on Thursday.</p><p>Temperatures in the interior of the Atlantic country were forecast to hit 44 C (111 F) as hot, dry air blown in from Africa lingers over the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula. In June, 96% of Portugal was classified as being in either in \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d drought.</p><p>The hot air and parched ground, combined with strong winds, has created the perfect cocktail for severe wildfires.</p><p>Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa's government on Thursday extended a state of alert for wildfires until Sunday due to high temperatures. The week-long alert was originally to run until Friday. The Portuguese government has temporarily barred public access to forests deemed to be at special risk, banned the use of farm machinery and outlawed fireworks.</p><p>Costa said firefighters had to respond to 200 different blazes Wednesday and pleaded for his fellow citizens to take extra care when in the countryside.</p><p>\u201cMore than ever, we are the ones who must be extremely careful,\u201d Costa said. \u201cFrom a small act of carelessness a great tragedy can be born.\u201d</p><p>About 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) have been scorched this week in Portugal, according to the Civil Protection Agency. About 865 people had to evacuate their homes over the past week, although many had returned by Thursday. More than 30 homes and other buildings have been damaged.</p><p>Civil Protection commander Andr\u00e9 Fernandes said 160 people, including at least 70 firefighters, have been injured so far, but there are no confirmed fatalities from the fires in Portugal. Four people, including two firefighters, were seriously injured. Portugal has improved its fire safety since <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-ap-top-news-fires-international-news-portugal-24ed9af2c6574cb1aba9025796cdc4f1\">wildfires killed more than 100 people in 2017.</url></p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-wildfires-fires-italy-natural-disasters-dd0c50d724cdc545dc1002ad3de25351\">European Union has urged member states to prepare for wildfires</url> this summer as the continent faces another extreme weather shift that scientists say is being triggered by climate change.</p><p>In central Hungary, firefighters discovered a body Thursday where a small forest fire had burned overnight. It was found buried under the collapsed roof of a burned farmhouse near the village of Soltszentimre.</p><p>Spain was still combating a fire started by a lightning strike on Monday in the west-central Las Hurdes area that has consumed about 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres). Temperatures in many parts of Spain have been topping the 40 C (104 F) mark for several days and are expected to stay high until next week.</p><p>In France, two fires raged out of control in the region around Bordeaux in southwest France for a third consecutive day, despite the efforts of 1,000 firefighters and water-dumping planes to contain them.</p><p>The fires have destroyed more than 3,850 hectares (9,500 acres) of forest and grassland, the regional emergency said. It said firefighters struggled to contain the fire because of high winds and the difficulty of accessing the heart of the fires. More than 6,000 people have been evacuated from French campgrounds and villages in recent days.</p><p>___</p><p>Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.

Pockets of interior heat remain and will be watched closely over the coming days. But fire officials are optimistic.</p><p>\"We are in a vastly better place than we were three to four days ago,\" said Clark McCreedy, spokesman for the interagency team managing the fire.</p><p>Following weekend rain, light winds and damp land helped crews hunt down hot spots and contain a large portion of the fire as similar work continued along the northeastern and eastern sides early this week.</p><p>Once the northeastern corner of the fire is secured, McCreedy said, \"we'll see a nice chunk of fire considered contained.\" Securing the fire there is important because the town of Isabella is nearby. Crews are hoping to start a controlled fire this week to create a 100- to 200-foot buffer zone.</p><p>About 60 of the 300 evacuated residents returned home over the weekend, and power in some areas has been restored, Lake County Sheriff Carey Johnson said. More residents along the western and northwestern areas - where the fire has been contained - will likely be allowed to return soon. However, officials said, smoldering in a containment line can remain for months.</p><p>Jana Hollingsworth \u00b7 218-508-2450</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRIB-MERLIN64157781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRIB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H9-CGT1-JC8F-K482-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8384</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"282\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)</publicationName><edition>METRO EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 1, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FIRE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D20W</classCode><className>DULUTH, MN, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS139</classCode><className>MINNESOTA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Here's a handy guide to the  Wolf Pack  characters from the stars themselves.  Wolf Pack  premieres Jan. 26 on Paramount+. <br/> 'Wolf Pack' boy characters have complicated issues<br/>Armani Jackson plays Everett Lane. Jackson explained how a werewolf bite helps him cope with real-world issues. <br/>'He lived in a constant state of anxiety,' Jackson said. 'He treats anxiety with medication, therapy, just the general ways that people deal with anxiety. His parents can be quite disapproving and doubtful of his mental health issues, especially his mom. But one day he is attacked and bitten during a wildfire in a traffic jam and in that he gains supernatural abilities. A real family and a newfound purpose in life.' <br/>Everett joins a wolf pack with Harland Biggs, played by Tyler Lawrence Gray.

'He likes living life on the edge, and he really just likes going by his own rules. He is kind of the irresponsible part of the group. You know, the part that will always make the group laugh, but won't always come in to help them out at the end of the day. He is a very protective and caring person, especially to his sister Luna. However, he has a lot of built-up anger and rage and he tends to take it out on some things that don't deserve it sometimes. You will see that a lot more in the show. But as the whole pack comes together, you will see how all of our different personalities bounce off of each other.' <br/> 'Wolf Pack' female characters in conflict<br/>Bella Shepard plays Blake Navarro, a new werewolf who encounters a wolf bite at the same time as Everett. <br/>'She starts out in a wildfire going through a lot with her family,' Shepard said. 'Her life completely changes not only because of the massive wildfire in Los Angeles, but also because of something being bitten on the freeway, actually with Everett, by an animal during the rampage on the freeway. She's reluctant to embrace her new family, and, like, friends. Then she realizes that as she gains more confidence in herself, and learns to trust people who really care about her, that she belongs in this pack. They work better as a team.' <br/>Chloe Rose Robertson plays Luna Briggs.

'She is constantly, towards the beginning more confused and 'we don't know if this is what we want.' That's the majority feeling, but Luna has always hoped for and wanted a pack, and friends who understand her. I think she really loves the people who come into her life very quickly, and she has a lot of empathy for them as well.

Now, he plays park ranger Garrett Briggs, who also has more to him than just the forest fire. <br/>This is a man of strong values, someone with dark secrets, and deep suspicion especially towards anyone questioning the relationship with his kids. He is a protector. I do love the idea of playing a park ranger for many reasons, which I am not going to go into depth here now. When I was researching about this character, I liked what they described as what a park ranger is. I think a lot of people have sort of, like, a stereotypical idea of what a park ranger does and what kind of person is this. I discovered that there's three pillars on a park ranger: The law enforcement people, but they could be environmental experts or even like a historian, or the combination of the three. We have with Garrett a combination of the three. I don't want to disclose much more, because I want the viewers to discover who this character is. &lt;cite &gt;Rodrigo Santoro, Television Critics Association panel, 9/21/22 &lt;/cite &gt; <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/wolf-pack-teen-werewolves-cast-characters.html/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-WSCS107994167457306520525876100214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WSCS-6701</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CY-XM31-JCMN-Y0F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><timeReceived>3:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Cheat Sheet</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 24, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Entertainment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>horror</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VNP</classCode><className>HORROR FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VNP</classCode><className>HORROR FILMS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In the village of Bemposta, residents used garden hoses to spray their lawns and roofs in hopes they could save them from the raging wall of red flames that approached through the wooden hills late Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cIt began spreading towards that way, the wind was blowing that way towards the mountain,\u201d said 88-year-old Antonio Carmo Pereira, while pointing to the flames on the outskirts of his village. \u201cIn a few minutes I couldn\u2019t see anything, just smoke.\"</p><p>\u201c(It\u2019s) dangerous, yes. It\u2019s surrounding all the houses,\u201d he said. \u201cI am afraid, but where can I go? Jump into a water tank? Let me stay here and look.\u201d</p><p>More than 800 firefighters were still fighting blazes in the Leiria district, where Bemposta is located, on Thursday.</p><p>Temperatures in the interior of the Atlantic country were forecast to hit 44 C (111 F) as hot, dry air blown in from Africa lingers over the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula. In June, 96% of Portugal was classified as being in either in \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d drought.</p><p>The hot air and parched ground, combined with strong winds, has created the perfect cocktail for severe wildfires.</p><p>Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa's government on Thursday extended a state of alert for wildfires until Sunday due to high temperatures. The week-long alert was originally to run until Friday. The Portuguese government has temporarily barred public access to forests deemed to be at special risk, banned the use of farm machinery and outlawed fireworks.</p><p>Costa said firefighters had to respond to 200 different blazes Wednesday and pleaded for his fellow citizens to take extra care when in the countryside.</p><p>\u201cMore than ever, we are the ones who must be extremely careful,\u201d Costa said. \u201cFrom a small act of carelessness a great tragedy can be born.\u201d</p><p>About 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) have been scorched this week in Portugal, according to the Civil Protection Agency. About 865 people had to evacuate their homes over the past week, although many had returned by Thursday. More than 30 homes and other buildings have been damaged.</p><p>Civil Protection commander Andr\u00e9 Fernandes said 160 people, including at least 70 firefighters, have been injured so far, but there are no confirmed fatalities from the fires in Portugal. Four people, including two firefighters, were seriously injured.

It said firefighters struggled to contain the fire because of high winds and the difficulty of accessing the heart of the fires.

Gen. Jamison Herrera, deputy adjutant general of the New Mexico National Guard, said it was an honor to pin the Bronze Star on Duran. Herrera said the old warrior's military records were lost in a 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center in</p><p>St. Louis.</p><p>Though Duran's family began working to restore the documents in some way, the former soldier \"wanted nothing to do with it,\" Herrera said, citing Duran's modesty about his military record.</p><p>Though Duran eventually received a Bronze Star in the mail for his participation in the Battle of the Bulge, he had never received a formal award-pinning ceremony, Herrera said.</p><p>There were plenty of happy faces as Duran received his long-awaited honor.</p><p>Herrera called Duran \"a patriot ... a great citizen and one of a man of faith.\"</p><p>Faith - and luck - saw Duran through some tough situations during World War II. But his life story is about far more than his time in the military.</p><p>From Spain to Golden to Santa Fe</p><p>Duran's grandfather came to New Mexico from Spain to work in the mines at Golden.</p><p>His father Matias was a prosperous shoemaker. Duran said his father fashioned three kinds of cowboy boots: for riding, roping and walking. He made orthopedic shoes, and when people came into his shop on crutches, he took casts of their feet and legs and fitted them with special shoes. Many were able to leave their crutches behind when they exited the store.</p><p>The family lost everything in a Colorado bank failure. He, his parents and siblings left their house in downtown Santa Fe with only the clothes on their backs and rented a place on an undeveloped part Cerrillos Road, across from what is now Santa Fe Indian School, for $25 a month.</p><p>On the empty land around their house, Duran hunted prairie chickens for family meals with a BB gun. He learned to shoot with precision - and it probably saved his life many times during World War II.</p><p>Duran attended St. Michael's School on College Street, now called Old Santa Fe Trail. He rode his bicycle (to which he later added a gas engine) to school at 9a.m., got out at 3p.m., rested for a few hours then went to work from midnight to 7a.m. at Kaune's Bakery. Later he delivered medicine for a pharmacy on the Plaza using his gas-powered bike. He left St. Michael's at eighth grade.</p><p>A mentor, Art Ulibarri, an airplanes and engines mechanic who worked at the old airport on Cerrillos Road, recommended him to a Boeing scout for an apprenticeship. Duran left home at age 16.</p><p>\"Either you worked for the state hospital or flipped burgers,\" he recalled. \"There wasn't nothing.\"</p><p>In Seattle, he went to public school, worked at Boeing and attended night classes in engineering. His hobby was racing a Harley motorcycle that he had \"souped up. There was nothing that could beat it. I won money.\"</p><p>Duran was called to the service while working as an A&amp;E apprentice in Seattle. He explained to the Army that he was a machinist, \"I told them I knew a B-17 inside out. And if they didn't have a part, I could make it.\"</p><p>He was told the Army needed men for the infantry.</p><p>In June 1944, Duran took part in the invasion of Normandy. He said the troops embarked on big ships at Portsmouth, England, transferred to skiffs some five miles from France, and at 50 feet from shore, unloaded under German machine gun fire.</p><p>\"The closer we got, the redder the water was,\" he recalled.</p><p>He dropped his pack and swam to shore underwater. Once ashore, the men exploded a razor wire fence with torpedoes and captured a German pillbox.</p><p>By Christmas Eve, Duran was in the Battle of the Bulge. In deep snow, he served as a scout and got \"frost damage\" twice.</p><p>Duran and his captain were on reconnaissance to discover how to cross a river to join Allied paratroopers. They encountered Gen. George S. Patton and explained how they were making plans to surprise the enemy. Patton said he had another plan: to meet the Germans head-on.</p><p>\"GIs are expendable,\" Patton told them. Duran, just a private first class, said he \"lit up like a firecracker\" and told Patton, \"officers are expendable, too.\" Patton agreed to let them try a surprise crossing of the river.</p><p>After midnight, Christmas morning, nine men including Duran waded the icy water. They came across an American paratrooper's encampment, where they were given pancakes and one apple each. By the time the pancakes were served, they were frozen, but the soldiers thawed them under their jackets and \"they tasted just like turkey to us!\"</p><p>\"When the Germans attacked us, we were ready for them. That was the turning point of the war.\" The Americans knew they were winning when they saw German horse-drawn artillery trapped in the mud.</p><p>Duran recalled one easy way to find the Germans was to smell them, as their rations consisted of black bread and canned sardines.</p><p>He was wounded in the battle but never received a Purple Heart, as his commander failed to file the paperwork.</p><p>By April 1945, Duran and his comrades became liberators of the Dachau concentration camp. Inside, they found gas chambers and dead men, women and children stacked high.</p><p>Bilingual in Spanish and English, Duran was able to assist Spanish prisoners, who were mostly politicians. He asked them why they had no fingernails; the Spaniards told him that when they arrived at the camp, the Germans had pulled out their nails with pliers.</p><p>\"They were skin and bones. I still have dreams,\" he said. \"There was something you never forget.\"</p><p>Duran and other soldiers were on their way to Japan when he heard a wave of sound traveling along his ship, with men shouting, \"The war is over!\" He said he will always think of Harry Truman as \"my buddy\" because the president made the decision to drop the atomic bomb on the Japanese.</p><p>Coming home</p><p>Honorably discharged as a sergeant first class, he stayed in the Army Reserve to help train two battalions during the Korean War. But the postwar was not easy. When he returned to Seattle, Duran found no work as the defense plants had closed. He traveled to the Midwest looking for work and his union found him jobs in Chicago, the Twin Cities and St. Louis.</p><p>Back in Santa Fe, he worked as a machinist at a Ford dealership, later at the Lincoln Mercury dealership.</p><p>In 1950, he married Beatrice Ortiz, whose father was a watchmaker on Cleveland Street in Santa Fe. \"I really didn't start living till I married her,\" he said. They were together for 62 years, until her death in 2012.</p><p>Duran said he applied for a job at the lab in Los Alamos and was told the installation didn't hire Spanish Americans and didn't hire locals - especially those who had worked on the West Coast.</p><p>But since he had answered a nationally placed ad, he was granted an interview. He explained about his work as a machinist at Boeing. His interviewer, a man named Wilson, told him \"we just don't hire people from down there.\" Yet Wilson said that if the lab didn't hire him, it would be seen as prejudiced. He was given a job on a lathe. Paid $2.90 per hour, he had to sell his car to make ends meet.</p><p>In the 1960s, Duran overheard lab management saying they had bid on a job but didn't have the workers to complete it. He told officials of his tool and dye experience and said they could fire him if he and his mechanically inclined co-workers didn't complete the job. If his group succeeded, the lab would have to start an apprentice program.</p><p>He said he told his co-workers, \"Remember this, guys, this is the break we have been looking for.\" The team completed the work, and the apprentice program began in the early 1960s. It is still in place and very successful.</p><p>Duran worked at several locations on the Hill, including Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, an accelerator for which scientists propel neutrons and protons at high speeds in order to study their properties.</p><p>While with the space program, Duran said he developed a way to work with boron carbide, a material harder than diamonds. He patented his method but didn't profit.</p><p>\"I got the patent,\" he said. \"The lab got the money.\"</p><p>He was employed at Los Alamos from 1953 until he retired in 1985 to care for Beatrice.</p><p>Fifty years ago, he built the house in Cuyamungue, where he still lives. His six children - Cathy Fenner-Garcia, Patti Muxlow, Phillip Duran, Diana Duran, Loretta Apel and Nanette Duran - take turns visiting and staying with him. They have had successful careers: insurance company owner, hospital administrator, machinist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, occupational medicine specialist, computer security and nurse practitioner in urology.</p><p>His son is a mentor at LANL's apprentice program, which Duran helped start.</p><p>He works in his garage shop - with a treasured lathe - and enjoys the company of his grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.</p><p>After retirement, he toured World War II memorials with other veterans. At one site, all veterans were required to have wheelchairs. He pushed his, and when asked who was riding in the chair, Duran replied: \"It's the invisible man. I'm pushing somebody who couldn't come. I'm not a hero; the heroes didn't come home.\"</p><p>A century to remember</p><p>During Saturday's celebration, Duran said God must have been looking out for him.</p><p>\"I don't know why,\" he joked. \"God's a pretty mean guy sometimes.\"</p><p>As for turning 100, he said, \"It's just another birthday.\"</p><p>After Herrera pinned the Bronze Star on his chest, Duran kept his acceptance speech short and to the point.</p><p>\"Thank you very much,\" he said. \"I made it another day.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15742627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:687H-6BD1-DY7H-R2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 14, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST10244945</classCode><className>US ARMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DM4C</classCode><className>NATIONAL ARCHIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001267</classCode><className>ORTHOPEDICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST10244945</classCode><className>US ARMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DM4C</classCode><className>NATIONAL ARCHIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DR5R</classCode><className>ADAPTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001267</classCode><className>ORTHOPEDICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX578</classCode><className>SANTA FE, NM, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Below is a collection of creative nonfiction and poetry from Audrey's Corner editor, Kailey Blount. In her creative nonfiction piece, \"No One Dances in the Desert,\" Blount writes of a forest fire to symbolize her relationship with chronic illness. In her poem, \"For Orange Bottle People,\" Blount writes to the disabled community recounting her experience as a disabled woman living in an able-bodied world.</p><p>No One Dances in the Desert</p><p>Two twigs snapped off a sycamore tree. No one noticed their disappearance, not even the sycamore himself. He'd argue later that he felt their loss like missing limbs. But, by then only the wind would be around to listen.</p><p>Anyways, they snapped, and they ran and if anyone noticed, no one cared. Afterall, they were twigs. Twigs snap under the smallest of pressures.</p><p>The forest wasn't a fool. She'd heard of fire. Forest Fires the humans called them. Like she had something to do with it. The wind had told her stories of fire's destruction. But like everything green, she didn't think harm could touch her.</p><p>So, when the twigs sparked a flame, she ignored them. They were twigs. Twigs that snapped without ever being touched. They were too weak to destroy her. Later, she'd deny feeling their spark- their pain. But, by then only the wind would be around to listen.</p><p>The fire did what fires do. He crept on burnt toes through rich soil hills, searing holes and spreading smoke. When the forest finally took notice, it was too late. He'd destroyed her deepest roots.</p><p>Engulfed in flames, she fell.</p><p>What was once green charred black. And from beneath the smoke, she wished to whoever watched from the clouds to give her back her roots, her trees, her twigs.</p><p>Desert sand didn't suit her. No one dances in the desert.</p><p>Forest Fires she whispered to the wind. Maybe I did have something to do with it.</p><p>It took many years for Forest to feel anything other than sand again. When she did it began with twigs.</p><p>For Orange Bottle People</p><p>my name's only ever been printed on orange bottles</p><p>i've imagined it just about everywhere else</p><p>mostly on pages</p><p>sometimes on chalkboards</p><p>anywhere but on these damn orange bottles</p><p>at least my letters don't live on paper bracelets</p><p>they did</p><p>i wore blue gowns and rubber socks for so long</p><p>i don't quite know what to wear anymore</p><p>they assume you know what to do</p><p>after living with the dead</p><p>but you never do</p><p>you know how to swallow pills</p><p>and words</p><p>you know how to turn wrists</p><p>and stomachs</p><p>you know how to rate pain</p><p>and faces</p><p>and nothing else</p><p>i've tried to learn</p><p>how to talk to strangers</p><p>drive in slow lanes</p><p>stand on bus lines</p><p>but mundanity escapes me</p><p>every time</p><p>and all too soon</p><p>the paper bracelets find me</p><p>again</p><p>failing to boil water</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5271264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652H-5R91-JBSN-300F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Spectrum: Sacred Heart University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 23, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Fairfield</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D9JQ</classCode><className>CHRONIC DISEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009V3K</classCode><className>CREATIVE WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UCO</classCode><className>POETRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000505</classCode><className>DISABLED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000479</classCode><className>DESERTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRLJ</classCode><className>HOSIERY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro, in for Sean tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with breaking news. Moments ago, Israel approved what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was calling a lull in the fighting with Hamas. In exchange, Hamas will reportedly return 50 hostages, women and children, during a four-day pause in fighting. And just in, \"Reuters\" is reporting that Hamas has also just agreed to the deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here now with the very latest from Tel Aviv, Alex Hogan is with us -- Alex.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Judge Jeanine.</p><p>This is major news. After weeks of trying to strike a deal, Israel tonight says that it has approved this hostage negotiation deal and what this would do essentially, allowing the release of 50 hostages, women and children, in exchange for a four-day ceasefire, as well as the release of Palestinians currently being detained in Israel. Israel also tonight says that if 10 additional hostages are released, every single day, that would allow another pause in the fighting.</p><p>We have heard concern from Israeli officials on the ground that any ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup, regain its forces and then fight back. But Israeli security officials tonight say they support this plan and that the security and intelligence will be maintained on the ground.</p><p>And families have been protesting day in and day out, calling on the government to strike a deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked President Joe Biden for some of the help in these talks, but while this agreed release of 50 people is a great win for people here in Israel, there's only freeing up 1/5 of the people that have been taken.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the way that this will work is that the hostages will likely be released in several groups and what we're expecting to see is that they could be released as soon as within 24 hours, only, of course, if everything from here until then goes according to plan -- Judge Jeanine.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls this a lull and not a ceasefire. Is there any significance to that?</p><p>HOGAN: I think there is, because looking at the strategic effort that we have seen the military continuing to move forward not only in the north but in the south, there is the real concern that Hamas could regroup, so there is going to have to be a lot of preparation on the ground to make sure that Israel is able to keep its strategic offenses and its ground forces where they are without giving up territory and without giving up any of the gains that they have made in the last several weeks being on the ground, but it is worth noting, of course, back here tonight, this is just a major celebrations for the families who are hoping what their loved ones could be a part of those 50 who could be released.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, certainly, a happy Thanksgiving in any event if it occurs in the next couple of days.</p><p>Alex Hogan, thank you so much.</p><p>What will this mean going forward?</p><p>Here now with more, author of the brand new book \"Unwoke: How to Defeat Cultural Marxism in America\", Senator Ted Cruz.</p><p>Senator, okay, I mean, you are now privy to the news that has been released moments ago. Hamas has just agreed to what the cabinet agreed to in Israel. What is the significance of this lull for a four-day period and 50 Israeli hostages? We don't know if Americans are included in those, for 150 Palestinian women and children, and I think we should remember that of the Palestinian women and children, they are in jail having been convicted of terrorism in Israel.</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Well, let me say at the outset, praise God if this news comes through and Israeli hostages are returned women and children that that is a wonderful development. You know, I have met with numerous families of hostages taking in Israel and it is horrific, the atrocities that were carried out when Hamas invaded southern Israel and to bring even one hostage home is a victory of 50 hostages are coming home that that is reason to give thanks this Thanksgiving.</p><p>There are also reasons to be concerned. Number one, the 150 Palestinians who are imprisoned in Israel that are being released, we don't know the identities of those, we're told. They're women and children.</p><p>One of the sad realities is that Hamas regularly uses teenagers to be terrorists and so there may well be individuals who've committed terrible crimes there. My understanding from the Israeli government is that they're not going to release any Palestinians who have murdered Israelis, that that's an important line to draw. But there will be negative consequences to people who have committed bad acts in the past, who may go forward and commit other bad acts.</p><p>There are also negative consequences in that giving Hamas several days to rebuild is going to make Hamas more dangerous. And that's why the Israeli war parliament debated this, why they considered what is the right option here. And ultimately, they made a judgment that it was worth it to bring 50 hostages home. That's reason to be -- to celebrate, but terrorists getting more dangerous, that's reason to be very concerned.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, and when you talk about the Israeli war parliament debating this, I mean the people in Israel have made it very clear to the Prime Minister Netanyahu that they want those hostages back. There was an incredible outcry in Israel, was there not, for that return at the very least of this 50 hostages.</p><p>CRUZ: Well, listen, there -- there is agony, the families, the communities who lost loved ones, whose loved ones have been -- have been kidnapped, every one of them is praying that their wives, their daughters, their children will be among those coming home. And you can understand that.</p><p>And listen, this is why terrorists take hostages because they force people into making terrible decisions. It is a bad thing that Hamas is going to have four days to regroup, that they're going to have time to refuel, that they're going to have time to get stronger.</p><p>And I think it's very important that even while we are grateful for the return of the hostages and I think Prime Minister Netanyahu quite wisely said that he will continue the pause for additional days if additional hostages are getting released, that we not lose sight of -- Israel has laid out two objectives here. Number one, getting the hostages home, so this is making real progress. But number two, is utterly and completely eliminating Hamas.</p><p>And I do worry that that as hostility cease for a short period of time, that international pressure and sadly pressure from the Biden White House will only get greater, only get more significant to try to prevent Israel from resuming its work to follow through on that commitment. And eliminating Hamas, the terrorists, the monsters who committed this horrific attack, that is important for Israel's national security and it's important for America's national security.</p><p>October 7th, in addition to being a horrific attack on Israel, remains one of the worst terrorist attack in American history, 31 Americans were murdered that day, roughly a dozen taken hostage. We hope there may be some Americans among these 50, but we have no indication that's the case.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, and during this lull and I guess using the term ceasefire suggests that maybe the war is stopping, will Israel be able to have drones, unmanned drones to at least see what is going on, what Hamas is doing, whether they are rebuilding, whether they are moving things? I mean, will we have any idea, will Israel know what Hamas is doing?</p><p>CRUZ: Well, sure, I have absolute certainty that Israel will continue surveillance, continue monitoring. And one of the most significant elements of this agreement is that it will allow roughly 300 aid trucks to come from Egypt into Gaza, including fuel trucks and the consequences of that are significant because Hamas uses that fuel, many of the Hamas terrorists are in tunnels, underground, and for Hamas to be able to refuel, enables them to continue and maintain those tunnels that makes them more dangerous going forward.</p><p>PIRRO: And the truth is, I mean, they do have fuel themselves to be demanding fuel from Israel. And I understand the trucks going in. But it's also humanitarian, it's food and medicine, in addition to fuel, correct?</p><p>CRUZ: Well, that's right. And listen, that there are real humanitarian disasters unfolding in Gaza. What is happening to the civilians there is terrible and that is inflicted by Hamas. Hamas deliberately uses civilians as human shields. It uses Palestinian women and children. It puts them in harm's way. It bases its headquarters in the basement of hospitals. It locates missiles in kindergartens because it wants Palestinian civilians to be casualties.</p><p>Israel -- Israel goes to greater lengths to avoid civilian casualties than any military force on the face of the planet. But nonetheless, there are inevitably civilian casualties because Hamas puts Palestinian civilians in harm's way. And also, as a consequence of that, there is real suffering among Palestinian civilians. And so, some of that aid is necessary but the challenge is Hamas takes much of that aid and uses it for the terrorist first.</p><p>PIRRO: Exactly.</p><p>CRUZ: And so, that's a trade-off the Israeli government considered and they made the judgment that bringing 50 hostages home was worth the negative consequences of Hamas terrorists getting more dangerous and more difficult to eliminate in future days.</p><p>PIRRO: The problem, however, is there are four times that number still held hostage, including Americans.</p><p>CRUZ: Yes, yeah.</p><p>PIRRO: Senator Ted Cruz, thanks so much for being with us tonight.</p><p>And despite the temporary ceasefire in Gaza, there is a growing risk of terror right here at home, especially in New York. CBS News reports that the New York state intelligence center currently believes the threat of an attack in the states is increasing as the war rages on.</p><p>Apparently, would-be attackers are focused on so-called soft targets. Like protest and large public events.</p><p>Here now with reaction, our former FBI special agent Nicole Parker and IDF special operations veteran, Aaron Cohen.</p><p>All right. Nicole, I'll start with you.</p><p>Given this CBS report, we are inching right onto Thanksgiving. There will be a number of people in New York City and, of course, as we go into the holidays as well. But starting on Thursday with the -- I believe it's the Macy's Day Thanksgiving parade, and the throngs of people come into New York City.</p><p>What do you say to New Yorkers based upon this report?</p><p>NICOLE PARKER, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: You know, I say it to New Yorkers and to anyone that might be visiting New York, now is the time to be extremely vigilant on high alert and to keep your head on a swivel. You know, as Americans, I'm a big proponent do not live in fear, we don't want to live in fear. The terrorists are not going to win, but we need to be extremely vigilant and aware with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, coming tree lightings, you know the ball dropping on New Year's Eve, there are going to be a plethora of events.</p><p>And there's nothing more that a terrorist would like than to cause chaos, violence, destruction and death at these celebrations that frankly celebrate religious freedom in the United States. You know, whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever your religion might be, that is what this time is. And New York City is the epicenter of many of these celebrations.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, and to Aaron Cohen.</p><p>Aaron, you know, this deal for the hostages, a quarter of them, 50 of them, in exchange for criminals, jailed and convicted in Israel and the children that they're talking about are apparently children who were born in the jails, in Israel, why do you think Hamas agreed to this?</p><p>AARON COHEN, ISRAELI SPECIAL OPS VETERAN: Well, Judge, let me just say it's good to see you again. It's been a minute.</p><p>PIRRO: Thank you.</p><p>COHEN: As far as -- as far as the ceasefire goes, here's where I'm at with this right now. This ceasefire I believe was initiated by Hamas. Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas inside of Gaza, he's feeling the noose getting tighten around his neck, he's getting desperate. There's a couple of brigades left of Hamas militants, that have completely been surrounded, what we call in Hebrew (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>Israel's been brilliantly unfolding a pressure cooker campaign, using a high degree of selectivity like Senator Cruz said, very careful with the civilians, a lot of special ops forces on the ground, moving house to house, those tunnels almost completely mapped out at this point. The dog unit, in Hebrews what it's called (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>The archangels of those tunnel operations and mapping everything we've seen under the Shifa Medical Center. Sinwar is getting desperate. The leaders in Qatar sitting in those six-star hotels are getting desperate, Khaled Mashal. You've got Ismail Haniyeh.</p><p>And they're sitting there and everybody knows that the news has completely been tight and all these Hamas militants trying to get to the south of Israel now, and all they're trying to do is show strength.</p><p>And so, listen, the hostages are have always been the key piece for us. We rescue our people. They're a big deal. We waited five -- we did it in '76 in Entebbe, in July, we got back 103 hostages. We're in the hostage rescue business.</p><p>And we -- you know, while we may not have invented it like I've been saying, we perfected it. Israel's really good at counterterrorism. So we're going to take those hostages back, but I can assure you, to your previous chat with the senator, Israel is going to have a very high degree of surveillance all over Gaza. We got that whole place on lockdown, and the reason why is because Israel's a master at that intelligence gathering.</p><p>So we're going to keep an eye on everything. All the supply lines have been cut off. No one's moving any supplies. We want to get those trucks in there too for the Palestinian people who were trapped in the center of Gaza.</p><p>And so, Israel is going to keep a very tight eye. Our Shin Bet, our Mossad, our Aman, intelligence agencies and it's okay. We want those hostages back. We're going to take them, but we're going to keep a very close eye on exactly how this unfolds over the next couple of days.</p><p>And this ain't a ceasefire, Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah.</p><p>COHEN: This is what I call a little tactical snack of a pause, That's all it is.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah, yeah, agree, agree with you.</p><p>And, Nicole, I'm going to go back to you on -- you know, with the defunding of police, with the FBI so focused on January 6th for so long, you know, how can Americans feel comfortable even in New York City, the mayor announced yesterday that there was going to be a further cut in the police. Americans as they go forward, I know you talk about them being free and exercising their freedoms, but what should they look for and what should they be -- how -- what should they report if they see something?</p><p>PARKER: Well, first of all, to your point, I think that this is something that we talk about all the time here. There is a decrease in law enforcement because of this defund the police movement and all of this nonsense that's been going on for the last several years, yet there's an increase in threats. There's an increase in threats to Americans, counterterrorism attacks.</p><p>And you're right, I was at the FBI. Their number one focus for the last two and a half to three years has been January 6 Capitol violence, and now is the time that I sure hope that they're dedicating resources to foreign terrorist organization groups, what's happening at the southern border. We have no idea who's in our country. That is extremely dangerous.</p><p>You know, I know -- I know an agent who was a counterterrorism agent. And they said, you know what, will you please move me to the criminal side of the House because until you close the border, what's the point in working counterterrorism because you're welcoming potential terrorists into our country? It's extremely dangerous.</p><p>So for those that are visiting New York City, keep your eyes and ears open. You know, this threat could be a lone offender. It could be a foreign terrorist organization group.</p><p>Something that concerns me drastically and that the Department of Justice has warned about starting last year is a drone attack. Drones are extremely dangerous. You have no control. It's difficult to track them down. And, you know, some people do them for hobbies but yet, they can be dangerous. You can drop explosives with drones.</p><p>So just keep your eyes and ears open. If you see something, you say something. You call 911. You report it to law enforcement. And I sure hope that the FBI has their resources dedicated to these threats, because this is what Americans are most concerned about right now.</p><p>PIRRO: And, Aaron, back to you with the last question. Okay, so we've got hopefully hostages coming back. We've got four times that. We've got another 150 as far as we know over there. How long do you think this offensive will take? And will Hamas keep trying to interrupt the flow of Israel in its takedown of Hamas?</p><p>COHEN: Judge, it's a good question. I don't want to speculate on the idea of macro operation in terms of how long it's going to take, but I think Israel is starting to put the bow on the Hamas package here. I don't think it's going to take long, but Israel's got to be very diligent. They got to be very careful. The tunnels are complex.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah.</p><p>COHEN: So what we call tubular or linear assault, at the end of the day, they got to get in there. But I want to talk to -- to your guest's last answer also because I think she was on to something. I want to take a minute right now. I've been training law enforcement in this country for 20 years, teaching the Israeli model of counterterrorism.</p><p>And I want to speak to every chief and every sheriff out there. You better start taking your training seriously, and I'm a big fan of law enforcement, but you really want to have an honest look at your at your SWAT training. I know that these SWAT teams get together about once a month.</p><p>Two, the alert program which is $130 million program funded by state and federal money out in Texas, and what we saw in Uvalde may have been a reflection of that training which in my opinion is a little outdated. So, to all those sheriffs and chiefs out there, you better start having a good look at your training, making sure it's behavioral based, making sure you can do point shooting and not get on those sites when you're in that chemical dump, and make sure that you've got counterterrorism based training because this ain't going to look like Uvalde, this ain't going to look like a Columbine. This could be several dozen to several hundred of these popping up right now, and you get better get serious with your tactics and start being very honest about your response capabilities.</p><p>And I'm not talking about the bigs (ph). I'm talking about every city across this country. There's a lot of them out there. Start getting serious about your training and have an honest look and ask yourself are our patrol officers and school resource officers who are going to be our SWAT teams, those real first responders, are they capable of responding to those threats under those massive levels of stress, and can you do it in a counterterrorism based platform?</p><p>PIRRO: You hit the nail on the head, Aaron. I want to --</p><p>COHEN: Judge, just trying to -- I'm just trying to park my car in the same garage as you.</p><p>PIRRO: You got it and we're in the same garage.</p><p>Nicole Parker, as well, thank you both.</p><p>All right. Coming up, as U.S. soldiers face more and more attacks in the Middle East, Joe Biden is headed to Nantucket for a luxurious Thanksgiving getaway. Not a care in the world.</p><p>We'll have all the details as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>The world is on fire and so is Joe Biden's birthday cake with 81 candles. Apparently, as it turns out, 81 candles creates quite a flame. Almost nothing is going right for Joe Biden or the country that he serves.</p><p>Tonight, according to the Pentagon, U.S. soldiers have been attacked at least 66 times in the last few weeks. This includes a major strike against U.S. forces at an airbase in Iraq. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: And since I know you'll ask, U.S. forces have been attacked approximately 66 times since October 17th, 32 separate times in Iraq and 34 separate times in Syria. U.S. personnel have sustained approximately 62 injuries, but this does not include any injuries from last night's attack as they are still being evaluated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: In response, the U.S. has launched a few different airstrikes in the region, including one against an Iranian Revolutionary Guard facility in Iraq. But so far, these countermeasures have to deter attacks. The world is at war, American soldiers abroad are at risk, the economy is a disaster, and the 81-year-old president is barely able to form a coherent thought.</p><p>Biden is now in down almost every poll to every possible Republican hopeful, including Donald Trump. But Joe doesn't seem to have a care in the world. He's headed to Nantucket for luxurious and relaxing Thanksgiving with his family and friends.</p><p>Joining us now with the reaction, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, the host of Outkick's \"Tomi Lahren is Fearless\", Tomi Lahren, and FOX News contributor Joe Concha.</p><p>You know, I'm going to start with you, Mike Huckabee. You know, we've had - - now they say 66 times since October 17th that we've been attacked by the proxies in Iran, from Iran. And yet, we are barely fighting back. Why do you think that is when so many of our soldiers have been injured with injuries that are very serious, TBI, traumatic brain injuries, which are -- can be lifelong?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, Judge, you got to remember, this is an administration that has given a lot of cash awards to the Iranians. We've blessed them not just with the $6 billion of unfrozen money, but we've turned their oil spigots back on. That's 80 billion bucks they've been able to get from that.</p><p>So we're obviously not that worried about what they do. We're making it possible for them to gain nuclear capacity. And I just believe with all my heart that if Donald Trump were still president, and I hope he is again, I don't think we'll have this kind of situation because the Iranians won't take these chances.</p><p>Instead, Joe's sitting there with his birthday cake. That thing's flaming up so much, my gosh, I think it increased global temperatures by 2 degrees nationally. It looks like a forest fire. I'm expecting smoky bear to rush in there and put it out and say, only you can prevent fires like this, Joe.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah. You know, I got to tell you, Tomi, I think that that birthday cake with 81 candles on it, I mean, as opposed to getting eight and one, two candles, I think it's a metaphor for America, that we're in flames right now, whether it's the economy, crime, the border, what's going on in the Middle East. What say you?</p><p>TOMI LAHREN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, it really looks like a dumpster fire and that is the perfect symbol for Joe Biden's presidency. But, you know, it's one thing to be off with your family for Thanksgiving. Most presidents do that. There's nothing wrong with that. The problem is that according to a lot of research by the RNC, he spent about 40 percent of his presidency on vacation.</p><p>Now, White House or will say, hey, listen, Joe is working while he's on vacation. Well, he's not even working when he's in the oval office. I don't really buy the fact that the man that can't figure out which is the exit or when to leave or when to enter, he can't call on reporters without a cheat sheet. I highly doubt he's working while he's on vacation on the beach or in Nantucket or wherever he wants to go.</p><p>This president is entirely asleep at the wheel, which means somebody is running this country into the ground. And I didn't vote for Joe Biden judge, but I certainly didn't vote for whoever is running our government right now. And me and millions of other Americans would sure like to know who that person is.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, Joe Concha, the amazing part of all this is the Democrat Party, they talk about, oh, we're for choice and freedom and all this stuff, 71 percent of the Democrats think Joe's too old to do the job and yet they're insisting that he be the guy to run. They -- you know, he's not engaging in any kind of debates, it's Joe Biden, when America clearly -- I mean, we're tired of the stumbling and the bumbling. What say you?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I say, Judge, if there was a plan B, which I think was supposed to be Kamala Harris, and now she's all the way back to plan Z, if there was somebody viable to put forward, then that would be one thing. But they just don't seem to have too many options.</p><p>But regarding this Nantucket vacation here for six days, one would think that somebody who is nicknamed Scranton Joe would go back to his hometown in Pennsylvania. But every Thanksgiving, Mr. Biden always seems to have friends with homes so big that they have their very own zip code that you can probably see from outer space.</p><p>And this just shows you, Judge, and this is a problem for the Democratic brand in general, they are no longer the party for the working man or woman, but they're the party for elites, for hedge fund billionaires, like the home that Mr. Biden is staying in, the richest 1 percent of the richest 1 percent. I mean, we're certainly a long way from Wall Street -- Occupy Wall Street, that's for sure.</p><p>And as usual, Biden looks profoundly toned deaf to be staying at a Nantucket estate valued at $34 million, all while so many families will be struggling to put food on the table this Thanksgiving.</p><p>And in fact, the average cost of a Thanksgiving meal this year is the second highest ever on record. It's also 25 percent higher than it was in 2019 when Donald Trump was in office. And this is why -- there's several reasons why Donald Trump and poll after poll as you just showed beating Joe Biden not only nationally but in those important swing states, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada.</p><p>And this is why many Democrats like David Axelrod are publicly saying, get out, Joe. You simply cannot win. The question is, who do you put in? Mariano Rivera is not waiting in a bullpen, that's certainly for sure.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Mike Huckabee, I'll go back to you. You know, but Joe Biden will tell you -- Karine Jean-Pierre actually -- will tell you that Bidenomics is great, but I can't help but agree with Joe and what you said earlier. If Donald Trump were the president right now, we wouldn't be in this mess.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, I don't think we would. I find it interesting that Karine Jean-Pierre would say such things about how great Bidenomics is. I wonder if there's one American family that will gather around the table and when they say their prayer or Thanksgiving will say, thank you God for Bidenomics. Thank you that our groceries and gasoline cost more. Thank you. We can't afford a house or a car.</p><p>Yes, God, thank you for Bidenomics. It makes us all feel what most of the rest of the world has to feel, living in poverty. We used to live in real prosperity but no longer thanks to Bidenomics.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah, and you know, Tomi, I mean, in the end, what you've got is a - - is a party that is pushing Joe on us. You know, Donald Trump and there are several in the -- who were in the presidential primary, but Donald Trump it seems, the more that time goes on, it's clear to everyone that he's the guy that we've got to have in there to fight the fight for America, with all of these attacks on Air Force -- on our military guys in Iraq and Syria. I mean, they're not afraid to hit us.</p><p>LAHREN: If only it were that easy as us wanting Donald Trump to be in office and if only the polls gave us the full picture. You know, Judge, I don't want to be the Grinch this early before Christmas, but I will say this, there's the reason the Democrats are -- they're scrambling, but they're not in full panic mode, and that's because they know that they have, the electioneering ground game down. They've got early voting, they got mass mail in ballots. They are ready to go.</p><p>So they can hide Joe in the basement. That's how confident they are. So I'd love to sit here and be cocky but we really can't afford to do that.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah, last time it was the basement campaign. This time they call it the bubble campaign. All right. Mike Huckabee, Tomi Lahren, Joe Concha, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>And straight ahead, a new report says House Republicans are moving toward the final stage of the Biden impeachment inquiry. Gregg Jarrett and Stephen Miller join us next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>As we head for the end of the year, the House impeachment inquiry of President Biden and his family's overseas business dealings is hitting a critical phase. House Republicans have just a few more interviews left to conduct, including high stakes testimony from Hunter Biden before they're ready to decide whether to introduce articles of impeachment against Joe next year.</p><p>And while the White House claims the impeachment inquiry is baseless, the American people disagree.</p><p>A new Harvard-Harris poll shows that 60 percent of respondents believe that Joe was involved in Hunter's business dealings.</p><p>Here now with reaction is FOX News legal analysts Gregg Jarrett, and former senior advisor to President Trump, Stephen Miller.</p><p>Okay, gentlemen, good to have you both here.</p><p>STEPHEN MILLER, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Gregg, I'm going to start with you. Is there sufficient evidence? I mean, I understand, look, we don't have the FBI, we don't have the DOJ, the House is doing the investigation. So it's taken a while.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Right.</p><p>PIRRO: But are we there yet?</p><p>JARRETT: Oh, yes, I think you are. In the Burisma scheme alone, Joe Biden admitted on camera that he used his influence to get the prosecutor who was moving to shut down the company Burisma fired, at the same time his son was pocketing millions of dollars from that company to get his dad to do it. It's actually in an email.</p><p>You know, under the federal bribery statute, you know, Judge, as you will know, that's a crime. A public official using his office to confer a benefit in exchange for money to his family, doesn't have to go to him, to another person or entity is still a felony. And bribery, of course, is a stated ground for impeachment in the Constitution.</p><p>Should Republicans impeach? That's a different question. It can easily backfire especially when it's brought in the middle of a presidential election by an opposing party. The public will likely see it as election interference. Well, that's exactly what Democrat prosecutors have been doing against Trump, and look at the result, with every indictment, Trump support rises, because people see it for what it is -- an effort to deprive them of their right to decide.</p><p>So, you know, I think Republicans would be better off continuing to gather incriminating evidence, present it to the voters.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, you know, Stephen Miller, the -- what has happened with this investigation of Joe Biden is one shocking thing after another. And, I mean, I won't even get into the classified documents thing, for which Joe - - for which Donald Trump was indicted. I mean, this guy didn't even have the right to take classified documents out of -- out of this SCIF.</p><p>So, do you agree with Gregg? I mean, is this a good idea or a bad idea? Is it going to backfire?</p><p>MILLER: Well, I think it's a exceptional idea and a necessary one. I am strongly avowedly in favor of impeachment. The sooner, the better, the more articles of impeachment, the better. As Donald Trump has said now, year after year, Republicans need to grow a spine.</p><p>If Republicans continue to get beaten up, harassed, harangued, silenced, blacklisted, cancelled, prosecuted, driven out of every industry and every profession everywhere and all they can muster in response is a press release, a statement, an expression of disappointment, Republicans are doomed and the country is doomed.</p><p>As Gregg Jarrett said, they have Biden dead to rights on bribery, and they have him on many other crimes as well, not to mention his criminal, repeated, habitual violation of immigration laws and a conspiracy to commit human trafficking -- all impeachable offences from top to bottom.</p><p>PIRRO: At the border.</p><p>MILLER: We need a national debate on Joe Biden's corruption. We need a trial in the Senate and we need Republicans to get tough, to get smart and to show the country that they have the same strength, the same resolve as the Democrats, that they care as much about saving the country as Democrats do about wrecking it.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, what's interesting, Gregg, and I'll probably asked the same question of Stephen, I think a foreign saboteur, if he wanted to take down this country, could not do as good a job as Joe Biden has in terms of crime, the economy, the border. We haven't even seen the terrorism that's going to visit us, and you know, we're worried about impeaching the guy. Go ahead.</p><p>JARRETT: Yeah, I mean, you look at the polling data and Americans are pretty smart. They watch this man and they see he's not up for the job. Seventy percent of Democrats think he's just too old for the job, not equipped, not mentally and intellectually capable of doing it.</p><p>And then you factor in you know his lying about his involvement in his son's overseas deals. I mean the paper trail of visitor logs, photos, emails, texts, other documents show his complicity. Joe was aiding and abetting his son. The father meeting with foreign partners of hunter communicating with him.</p><p>PIRRO: No question.</p><p>JARRETT: Devon Archer confirmed they were selling access to Joe and promises of influence. That is the definition of corruption and selling out your country to America's adversaries.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Without a doubt.</p><p>But, Stephen, do you think that that they're too slow at this point? Should they have it now, Stephen?</p><p>MILLER: They are where they are right now. They've been working as hard as they can. As you say, they don't have the FBI, they don't have the DOJ, they have every scrap of evidence they need.</p><p>PIRRO: Yeah, I agree.</p><p>MILLER: Joe Biden is compromised and sold out to foreign powers.</p><p>PIRRO: I agree.</p><p>MILLER: And if that's not an impeachable crime, nothing is.</p><p>PIRRO: Hey, if a phone call is, that sure as heck is</p><p>Gregg Jarrett, Stephen Miller, great having you both on. Thank you.</p><p>And up next, recruitment woes in the military. Wait until you see what the army is doing now. We'll explain as Ronny Jackson and Monica Crowley join us on this special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>Amid the military's recruitment woes, the Army sent a letter to soldiers dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, informing them that they may request a change in their military records following the rescission of all COVID vaccine requirements and telling them to contact their local recruiter should they wish to return to service.</p><p>Here with reaction, podcast host Monica Crowley, and former White House physician, Texas Congressman Ronny Jackson.</p><p>Okay, guys, we have the smallest active duty army since 1940. Why do you think that is, Ronny Jackson?</p><p>REP. RONNY JACKSON (R-TX): Well, you know, Judge, the military's been in the midst of a crisis regarding recruitment and retention for a while now. It actually started the very first day that Joe Biden came to office, and it coincides with his efforts right off the bat to change the focus of the military from training to fight wars to pushing their racist and woke agenda. And you're talking about nothing but DEI and CRT and pronouns and things of that nature. That ran a bunch of people off.</p><p>So we started with the -- we started with the issue then. And then the vaccine came in and they started pushing the vaccine, started mandating the vaccine, in fact. And a lot of people left. And, you know, these are highly trained people that they spend hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars training like Navy SEALs and fighter pilots and things of that nature, and they just ran these people off because they wouldn't succumb to or submit to the -- to taking this vaccine.</p><p>And, you know, Secretary Austin had no issue with it whatsoever. We tried our best to talk him into not doing this. We pushed the recruiting and retention issue over and over, he just would not hear it. We actually had to pass a law in last year's National Defense Authorization Act to make him -- make him get rid of the mandate and which he which he begrudgingly did.</p><p>And then we had also pass laws to keep these people from being discharged with other than honorable discharges, which affects their lives tremendously.</p><p>PIRRO: Of course, it does.</p><p>JACKSON: They go out. They get -- they have trouble getting jobs and stuff. So we have -- we have had to fight him on every single level and we're continuing to have to fight that fight. It's pathetic.</p><p>But now they realize what they've done. We tried to warn them and now they're scrambling trying to get these people back. And these people aren't going to come back. These people have no interest in coming back right now because the military is not the military that they signed up to serve in, and until Joe Biden leaves, it won't be.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, Monica, it's an interesting point. The truth is that this year, they miss recruitment by 15,000. So what do you think is going to be the reaction of someone who was involuntarily discharged, who is required to leave? Do they come back? I mean, what is the thinking there?</p><p>MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, Judge, we've got an all volunteer force. So, we should all be deeply grateful for anybody who stands up and raises their hand and joins the U.S. Armed Forces. And it's been absolutely disgraceful the way the government, the way the top brass in the military has treated individuals who stood up for their own bodily autonomy during COVID and said, no, I really don't want to take an experimental medication.</p><p>Eight thousand soldiers were kicked out of the U.S. military on the basis of not going along with a vaccine mandate. Only 43 soldiers have stood back up and said, yeah, I'd like to join again. I mean that is --</p><p>PIRRO: Wow.</p><p>CROWLEY: -- that is an absolutely horrendous number for our national security and for our armed forces. These people were not treated with any respect. Every single individual who came forward and asked for a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate was told absolutely not, get out.</p><p>So they wouldn't even respect -- forget the bodily autonomy argument. They wouldn't respect people's religious freedoms that they were trying to assert in the country that they wanted to fight and perhaps even die for. It's been absolutely despicable, but it really shows a giant hole in our national security because now they're going hat in hand begging these people to come back. They've moved on with their lives. And now, our -- all of our armed forces are facing a major hole.</p><p>You know, to Ronny's point, just one quick point, today, Judge, today, the U.S. Army asked for $114 million to advance their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The country is broke but the -- and the military can't attract talented people to join, but they want to seek the kind of money for DEI. This is why people don't want to join because they're more than happy to have these individuals who they hold in great contempt, average Americans, they're more than happy to have those people fight and die in their wars, but they show zero respect for them.</p><p>PIRRO: All right. Congressman Ronny Jackson, Monica Crowley, thanks so much for being with us tonight.</p><p>And coming up, the green new deal cult suffered a major setback at the hands of Ford. What happened? We'll tell you as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>Now, more bad news for the green new deal cult. Construction of Ford's electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan was halted back in September due to concerns over costs. And today, Ford announced they are moving forward with a project but with production capabilities cut by 40 percent and the number of jobs it is projected to create slashed by more than 30 percent. Their announcement comes as sales of electric vehicles have slowed across the country, forcing numerous automakers to scale back operations.</p><p>Ford's announcement is the latest blow to the Biden administration and further proof the American people aren't buying into his administration's green energy agenda.</p><p>Here now with reaction, Hoover institute fellow, Victor David Hanson.</p><p>All right, Victor, now, Americans really don't want electric cars, I'll start with that as a premise. Tell us what's going on.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: Well, I think we have a lot of utopians, Judge, and they are not attuned to market realities. So they keep saying you have to have in 10 years half of all car sales or all car sales actually in California have to be electric. Already, a quarter of all sales are electric but it's not market driven, it's driven by bureaucrats and now, people buy them, they don't have the range of a gas car. They tend to be more flammable. They're dangerous when you get in an accident. They're a third heavier, so they're sort of like torpedoes on the road. They're very dangerous.</p><p>And more importantly, how are you going to power them if you're not going to build hydroelectric, nuclear, gas or coal? And people are going to charge at night, there's -- wind and solar won't do it.</p><p>So I think the real subtext of all of this dilemma is that they don't want a private car powered by a fossil fuel and they went to EV as a substitute and the substitute didn't work and now, we're starting to hear that the real agenda is to get us into high-speed rail, buses, mass transit, subways and deal -- get away with the private vehicle all together because the EV is not going to replace what we have now.</p><p>So they have a different agenda here in California. Electricity prices went up 13 percent, they're going to go up 13 percent at the beginning of the year, and that's just one year, four times the rate of inflation.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know --</p><p>HANSON: And they're talking about, Judge, can you believe it? You plug your car in and they want you to power the grid from your battery at night.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, the amazing part of it is -- I mean, when you think about it, I mean, if you look at a street in many cities, all these cars are lined up, they don't have individual power station to power up their cars. I mean, so, it's almost impossible.</p><p>But if there is another president who comes in in 2024, I mean, does this all come to an end? I mean, can we switch back to fossil fuels? How does this work?</p><p>HANSON: I think so, because 99 percent of the emissions from fossil fuel cars are not toxic. The rub or the complaint against them is they create heat, but if you don't believe necessarily that manmade climate change is that severe, then I think you'll see a return to natural gas or hydrogen or gasoline or diesel.</p><p>There are all sorts of fuels that they can use and they are all safer, and I think they are more economical than electricity, batteries.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, I never felt like I lived in a totalitarian nation, but when they started talking about taking away my gas stove, I'm a cook -- I mean, it was like, I'll fight them every inch of the way. But it's not what the American people want, and we've spent billions in the infrastructure act, and that really is a sad commentary on Joe Biden, his connection to China and those batteries that we're buying from over there that we can't even dispose of properly because of the danger to the environment.</p><p>HANSON: No. And we need lithium mines and we're trying to stop mining of precious rare metals to power these batteries. And, here in California, it's the future. So, Gavin Newsom wants to do to America what he did to California.</p><p>PIRRO: We're not having it.</p><p>HANSON: A most frightening idea.</p><p>PIRRO: Victor Davis Hanson, thanks so much for being with us. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have tonight.</p><p>You can catch me week days on \"The Five\" and I'm going to be here tomorrow night at 9:00. See you then.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2023112101cb253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P9-G1H1-JCS1-6000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 21, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000CUUD</classCode><className>HAMAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS516120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUUD</classCode><className>HAMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000868</classCode><className>HOSTAGE TAKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp;

And Biden learned last week that inflation is probably not going to ease anytime soon - because Americans have barely touched the trillions in excess savings they have built up, thanks in large part to his catastrophic American Rescue Plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the main reasons inflation is skyrocketing is because Biden's first act as president was to pass nearly $1.9 trillion in social spending disguised as pandemic relief - sending millions of Americans stimulus checks, providing the largest child tax credit payments ever, and extending ludicrously generous unemployment supplements that paid many Americans more to stay home than to work.</p><p>The additional spending was completely unnecessary. Congress had just passed a $900 billion economic stimulus package in December 2020, on top of all the earlier COVID-19 relief measures Congress had approved. And thanks to the arrival of vaccines, when Biden took office, the pandemic was already fading, and the economy was recovering as people were getting back out and leading more normal lives.</p><p>But Biden wanted to show he was doing something - so he passed the American Rescue Plan, pouring an additional $1.9 trillion into the economy so he could claim credit for the post-COVID recovery. He did it despite warnings from even liberal economists.</p><p>With all that free money from Washington, personal savings rates soared. According to Moody's Analytics, by the end of 2021, U.S. households had built up $2.7 trillion in excess savings above what they would have had there been no pandemic.</p><p>Flush with government money, millions of Americans decided they could afford to stay on the sidelines and not to return to work - producing a historic labor shortage. Demand for goods and services soared as people emerged from pandemic lockdowns and started spending again, but supply could not keep up - in large part because businesses could not find workers. The result is inflation the likes of which we have not seen since the 1970s.</p><p>Today, the labor shortage persists, virtually unabated. Nearly 11.3 million jobs are unfilled in the United States today, a number almost unchanged from the record 11.85 million in March. Surveys show 60% of small businesses can't find workers to fill open jobs. And the labor shortage is not likely to dissipate until those excess savings run out.</p><p>Many hoped that when stimulus checks stopped arriving at the end of 2021, Americans would burn though their savings and start returning to work. But that is not happening. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. families have tapped just $114 billion of the $2.7 trillion in excess pandemic savings so far. That means they have $2.586 trillion left - more than the amount in Biden's American Rescue Plan. That fiscal cushion is keeping many workers out of the workforce.</p><p>What can be done? Stop spending. Instead, Biden tried to follow his American Rescue Plan with a multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better social spending plan. Democrats are furious with Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., for killing Build Back Better, but they may have saved Biden from even further disaster by doing so.</p><p>Has Biden learned from his mistakes? Apparently not. Just months before a wave election that is expected to sweep Democrats out of power on Capitol Hill, The Washington Post reports Democratic leaders are in \"frenzied deliberations\" with Manchin, trying to get him to sign off on one last Democrats-only spending bill before Republicans take over the House. Unfortunately, it appears that a deal may be close.</p><p>Inflation is a lot like a forest fire - once started, it's really hard to put out. But instead of trying to tamp down the flames, Biden keeps trying to pour gasoline on the inferno, with more spending and more free money from Washington. It seems the only thing that will stop the fiscal pyromaniacs in the Democratic Party is losing control of Congress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Marc Thiessen Marc Thiessen</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WISTJL-22071036507030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WISTJL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65WP-6321-JBM5-F524-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145460</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Madison Newspapers, Inc.

For those not aware, crypto miners in the past few years have been buying up pretty much every high-capacity GPU available on the market. This bid up prices and reduced availability to the point where even major cloud providers could not get their hands on current models. </p><p><br/>When combined with Moore's law, this has led to a situation where the average GPU hardware[2] being used for anything other than crypto is several years old and probably four times less powerful than normal market conditions would support. But this has also led many software companies to avoid optimizing their wares for GPU. So on average, the software you are using is probably ten times slower than it should be. <br/>That is probably the largest market opportunity in a generation, and smart companies should be looking now at how to exploit it. Speeding up your word processor or spreadsheet by ten times is unlikely to unlock any major business value. But there are several important areas which will. <br/>Analyzing data and database systems <br/>The most obvious area is database systems[3], particularly those operating on big data. The digitization of the world overall has not slowed down, and as a result, systems built on top of legacy databases are struggling these days just to keep up. This isn't always apparent to end users as a database issue but typically manifests as painfully slow screen refresh rates or stuck busy cursors. <br/> Event Intelligent Security Summit On-Demand <br/>Learn the critical role of AI &amp; ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch on-demand sessions today. <br/> Watch Here [4]  <br/>This has been mitigated somewhat by a move to cloud computing with automatic horizontal scaling (adding more CPUs). However, as data volumes get really big, the process of moving data across systems and between CPU boxes becomes rate limiting. The result is non-linear returns, where doubling the compute applied only gets you, for example, 50% more speed. <br/>The implicit response by most companies in this circumstance is, essentially, to stop even looking at all the data. For instance, you might aggregate hourly data to daily or daily to monthly. Under normal operating conditions with well-understood data, this can be fine. However, it comes at some risk because modern data science techniques require access to the primary granular data in order to drive a fundamental type of insight: anomaly detection. <br/>Don't ignore outliers <br/>Anomalies can be either good or bad, but they are rarely neutral. They represent your best and your worst customers and your company's best and worst responses. They include issues of high business risk and also of rewards. So solving a technology limitation by ignoring outliers is penny-wise and pound-foolish.  <br/>A classic example might be the utilities which until recently \u2014 and sometimes still \u2014 use 1km resolution data to monitor strike tree and forest fire risk. A single pixel in such a system might have 1,000 healthy trees and one dead one. But it only takes a single tree hitting a power line to a wildfire big enough to bankrupt a major utility.  <br/>The business risk, in that case, is hidden within decades-old data collection decisions underneath even older database technology \u2014 but it is nonetheless very real. And today would be a very good time to start addressing it since sources and methods have evolved rapidly over the last five years and have generally not exploited either GPU analytics or new hardware. <br/>Uncovering hidden market opportunities <br/>A similar situation exists with prospect and customer data[5] within many businesses. An accounting mindset and older technology can lead to routine aggregation of data into monthly and quarterly reports ad nauseam. But you should never forget that your customers are individuals whose cumulative experience across multiple touch points forms the basis for the likelihood to buy or recommend (or lack thereof). Just as with the risk above, market opportunities are hidden by default in common aggregations like sums and averages. <br/>This brings up another very important issue in business analytics[6], which is who within an enterprise is empowered to find such risks or opportunities. Perhaps the most important reason to upgrade older systems with GPU analytics is the availability of interactive no-code visual analytics. As the name implies, this allows a much wider number of people within an organization to notice a risk or opportunity and to dig in interactively to confirm or dismiss it. This could well be a salesperson or a front line employee not traditionally thought of as a 'data analyst' or 'data scientist.' <br/>Next steps for data and current systems <br/>All business situations are unique, so an enterprise's next move here may vary. But as a simple next step, managers should consider which parts of the business functions they are responsible for are using datasets or software tools more than five years old. Then look more specifically at 'big' data available relative to current systems and what value it might bring.  <br/>If they see an area of opportunity, then they have to consider what kind of quick pilot they might be able to organize to validate it. Paradoxically, without access to interactive GPU analytics, it can be hard to evaluate. So businesses should talk to vendors and consider testing in a cloud environment. The crypto miners' pain may well be enterprises' gain. <br/>Mike Flaxman is product manager with Heavy AI[7].  <br/>DataDecisionMakers <br/>Welcome to the VentureBeat community! <br/>DataDecisionMakers is where experts, including the technical people doing data work, can share data-related insights and innovation. <br/>If you want to read about cutting-edge ideas and up-to-date information, best practices, and the future of data and data tech, join us at DataDecisionMakers. <br/>You might even considercontributing an article[8]of your own! <br/>Read More From DataDecisionMakers[9] <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://avolio.swapcard.com/intelligentsecuritysummit2022/registrations/Start?utm_source=vb&amp;utm_medium=boiler&amp;utm_content=ondemand&amp;utm_campaign=IS22_BoilerPlates\">https://avolio.swapcard.com/intelligentsecuritysummit2022/registrations/Start?utm_source=vb&amp;utm_medium=boiler&amp;utm_content=ondemand&amp;utm_campaign=IS22_BoilerPlates</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/how-nvidia-is-driving-greener-computing/\">https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/how-nvidia-is-driving-greener-computing/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/built-for-purpose-databases-tackle-new-era-enterprise-challenges/\">https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/built-for-purpose-databases-tackle-new-era-enterprise-challenges/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://avolio.swapcard.com/intelligentsecuritysummit2022/registrations/Start?utm_source=vb&amp;utm_medium=incontent&amp;utm_content=ondemand&amp;utm_campaign=IS22_InContent\">https://avolio.swapcard.com/intelligentsecuritysummit2022/registrations/Start?utm_source=vb&amp;utm_medium=incontent&amp;utm_content=ondemand&amp;utm_campaign=IS22_InContent</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/what-is-customer-data-definition-types-collection-methods-and-analysis-best-practices/\">https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/what-is-customer-data-definition-types-collection-methods-and-analysis-best-practices/</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/enterprise-analytics/why-enterprises-should-put-data-analytics-in-the-hands-of-every-employee/\">https://venturebeat.com/enterprise-analytics/why-enterprises-should-put-data-analytics-in-the-hands-of-every-employee/</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heavy.ai\">https://www.heavy.ai</url>/ [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/contribute-to-datadecisionmakers\">https://venturebeat.com/contribute-to-datadecisionmakers</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/category/DataDecisionMakers/\">https://venturebeat.com/category/DataDecisionMakers/</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/enterprise-analytics/leveraging-the-fall-of-crypto-mining/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR107988167130430171925876100040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673V-Y7V1-F03R-N0KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><timeReceived>7:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 17, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>DataDecisionMakers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Enterprise Analytics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business Intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>category-/Finance/Investing/Currencies &amp;

The targeted places were in the mountainous area, something that stretched the firefighters' capabilities to the limit, given the lack of access roads into the dense forest. The forest fire trucks proved their usefulness, getting close to the affected areas, where Romanian and Greek firefighters intervened to locate and eliminate the hidden outbreaks left by the devastating fires,\" the cited source shows.The drone of the Romanian military firefighters, which flew over the area and gave the possibility to identify the exact vulnerable places also proved to be a real support.\"The missions of the Romanian firefighters ended late at night, when they returned to base,\" IGSU said.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 8th of June 2023. Today, we have the latest on Canada wildfires. Plus, how to stay safe with air pollution, and Mike Pence enters the presidential field.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>More than 400 wildfires continue to burn across Canada after displacing some 20,000 people north of the border. And smoke from the fires continues to drift into the United States. More than a hundred million Americans have been affected by air quality alerts according to the EPA. And at times this week, New York City's air quality has been the worst among the world's major cities. So why are there so many wildfires in Canada this summer? And is this the new norm? I spoke with USA TODAY National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise to find out more. Hello, Beth.</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>Hey, how are you?</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Good, thanks. Thanks for hopping back on the podcast. So Canada is burning. Can you just start by giving us an update on the wildfires north of the border?</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>Well, I wish I could. I wish I could, but I have to tell you that the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre website, which is the federal center up in Canada that lists them all, has been so inundated by people trying to figure out how many fires are burning that it has been crashed all day long. I got it up early this morning. We were at over 400 fires burning, more than half of those out of control. But I haven't been able to update that number in the last couple of hours because their site is down because everybody in the world is looking, at least everybody on the East Coast. But it is a ton of fires.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Beth, why are there so many wildfires in Canada this summer?</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>So Canada has this huge forest, the boreal forest. 38% of Canada is forest, mostly conifer forest. It has been really dry and really hot there. And the experts that we talked to said that kind... it's not just that they're in a drought, it's that it's hot. And so, the heat just sucks all the moisture out of the soil. It sucks it out of the plants, and they are just tinder-dry. And then when they get lightning strikes, which they normally do because it's a huge portion of their country, they just burn. And I mean this is really unprecedented. The Canadians are saying this is not normal. You always have forest fires in the summers and in the early spring, but this is way out of proportion to anything they've seen in the past.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Beth, you cover climate change as part of your beat. You've been here on the show. Often I ask you, is this issue caused by climate change? Is that issue caused by climate change? I'll pose the same question here. Fires like this, is climate change to blame, Beth?</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>We can never say that any one individual incident or weather event is climate change. However, what we do know is that the planet is warming. Not only that, it is warming more at higher latitudes. So that's why the Arctic is melting and Canada's at higher latitudes. So it has gotten a lot hotter in Canada say than it's got in Mexico. And so, they have these forests which have spent millions of years evolving to be in kind of cool a little damp conditions, and suddenly it's multiple degrees hotter than it used to be, and they're also being hit with droughts. Can I say that this year is caused by climate change? Not definitively. Can I say that all of these patterns point to... these are the conditions on the ground that are changing. And the worrisome thing there is you start talking to people who are forestry experts because anybody who lives on the East Coast and is seeing all the smoke, they're like, \"Wow, this is not normal. I don't remember this.\" Well, it's maybe something we're going to have to get used to.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Can we expect similar incidents like this going forward?</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>Not every year, but the numbers all show us that, especially the higher northern latitudes, they're getting increasingly hot and they're more likely to have droughts. And one of the climate scientists I spoke with, he said, \"It's a roll of the dice. You can have drought and you can have heat,\" and both of those things might contribute to fires, but if you have drought and heat at the same time, if you roll the dice and you get both of them, that can be when you get these mega fires. And we're going to see more of that dual combo with climate change.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>And we're getting into the prime months for US fire season as well. Are these Canadian fires a preview of what's coming stateside later this year?</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>Not as much. It's a big planet. We have different weather patterns. As you know, we had a very, very wet winter out here on the West Coast, especially in California. There's a lot of water and a lot of moisture still, especially up in the mountains. And so, experts are saying they're not expecting there to be the kind of mountainous fires that we've seen in past years. The concern, though, is when you get this much rain, you get a ton of brush and grass growth and that is going to dry out over the course of summer. Then you get these really fast wildfires. And I mean, we're hoping that isn't what we get this summer, but that would be the concern that we might have a bad fire season at lower elevations rather than at higher elevations. And of course, the bad part of that is that the lower elevations is where everybody lives.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right. Elizabeth Weise, thanks for your insight as always.</p><p>Elizabeth Weise:</p><p>So welcome.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Poor air quality alerts have been issued in several places nationwide this week, including New York. To get a better sense of the health effects of air pollution, I spoke with USA TODAY Health Reporter Adrianna Rodriguez. Welcome back to the podcast, Adrianna.</p><p>Adrianna Rodriguez:</p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>There have been a number of poor air quality alerts issued for the United States due to these fires north of the border. Adrianna, for folks who live in places that aren't used to these types of warnings, what's the purpose of an air quality alert?</p><p>Adrianna Rodriguez:</p><p>Yeah. So the purpose of an air quality alert is basically just to alert people that the air is unsafe to breathe for certain people. And this could be for a variety of things, but with the wildfires, it's usually because of sort of fine particle pollution known as PM 2.5.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Yeah, so let's get into some of the major health concerns when it comes to air pollution. You outlined a bunch of them here in this piece.</p><p>Adrianna Rodriguez:</p><p>Health experts tell me that air pollution, and especially fine particle matter, can really affect all organs. But it really does also affect breathing issues. Studies have shown that it could lead to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, non-fatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeats, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and it can also increase respiratory symptoms like coughing or difficulty breathing.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>What advice would you give to listeners, Adrianna, for how they can stay safe from air pollution this summer and beyond?</p><p>Adrianna Rodriguez:</p><p>Yeah, so the number one advice that I hear from experts on how to stay protected from air pollution is really just to stay inside. Don't go outside and don't breathe that polluted air. But obviously, there are some people who can't not be outside, people who work outside in construction or other things. And so, what they recommend is to wear an N95 mask, which we're all familiar with, thanks to COVID-19. They also recommend to take it easy for the day, not to do so much strenuous activity. And also take frequent breaks, stay hydrated, and on top of that, also monitor symptoms. If you're having trouble breathing or you don't feel well, then seek refuge inside where there is air filtration. For people who are staying inside, agencies also recommend setting their air conditioning units to a recirculate mode to prevent bringing in air from the outdoors, and then also to avoid sort of adding to air pollution, right? When we have these alerts and these warnings, you don't want to be burning wood or outside mowing your lawn or leaf blowing, barbecuing, things like that.</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>All right, great advice. Adrianna Rodriguez covers health for USA TODAY. Thanks, Adrianna.</p><p>Adrianna Rodriguez:</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Taylor Wilson:</p><p>Chris Licht, the embattled CEO at CNN is out at the company, effective immediately. The news first reported by trade publication Puck, and confirmed by CNN's parent company Warner Brothers Discovery, comes less than a week after he was the subject of a devastating profile in The Atlantic. The piece portrayed him as an ineffective leader presiding over a meltdown at the news organization, including plummeting ratings and a widely criticized town hall with former President Donald Trump. Licht took over last year after the company's then parent company, Warner Media, merged with Discovery. The new company made major changes to the network, immediately shutting down the CNN Plus streaming service and laying off hundreds of workers. Licht arrived at the company with a mandate to make CNN more middle of the road in its coverage, which many interpreted as more conservative. CEO David Zaslav said it would take several months to install a new permanent leadership team.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is running for president in 2024. On his first day as a presidential candidate yesterday, Pence used a CNN town hall event in Iowa to, in part, go after former President Donald Trump. On the January 6th insurrection, Pence said, \"I said today that I felt he was asking me to choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution, and I always will.\" But Pence wavered on other Trump related issues on current investigations. He said he hopes the Justice Department does not indict Trump over classified documents, saying that would be divisive. And he lamented the March indictment of Trump in a hush money case. He punted on a question of whether he would pardon Trump if he's convicted in one or more of the investigations against him. On the issues, Pence said he would continue to fight for the end of abortion, and said Russian President Vladimir Putin should not be rewarded for aggression, while repeating his past criticism of Trump for once describing Putin as a genius. And on spending, Pence said the government cannot address its debt crisis without making changes to social security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs.</p><p>\u2666</p><p>President Joe Biden yesterday vetoed a bill that would repeal his plan to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans. It's the fifth veto of his presidency and comes after the debt ceiling deal approved by Congress this month cut the pause to student loan payments that's been in effect since the start of the pandemic. That began under former President Donald Trump but was extended repeatedly by Biden. Still, this bill and Biden's veto were largely symbolic. A pair of cases before the Supreme Court, which could be decided this month, halted the loan forgiveness program from moving forward months ago. Before that, some 16 million borrowers had been approved to have some or all of their remaining student loan balances forgiven. Student loan payments are set to resume within 60 days of the court's ruling.</p><p>Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

'95 won the Democratic primary for Oregon's 5th congressional district against fellow Cornellian and 7-term incumbent Kurt Schrader '73 back in May.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 54.56 percent to 45.42 percent victory against Schrader marked the first time in 42 years an incumbent member of Oregon's congressional delegation had lost a primary election. If elected, Mcleod-Skinner would become the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve in Oregon's congressional delegation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mcleod-Skinner emphasized the importance of building relationships, trust and collective grassroots support. She said it helped her run as a lesbian in rural areas.</p><p>\"There are so many folks who said, I've never voted for [a] Democrat before, but you're just talking common sense. So showing that respect, listening, talking about solutions, staying away from buzzwords, really has a powerful response for folks,\" McLeod-Skinner said.</p><p>She had previously won the Democratic nomination for Oregon's 2nd congressional district in 2018, but lost the general election to 9-term incumbent Greg Walden. McLeod-Skinner later served as the city manager of Phoenix, Oregon, and in 2020, was hired as the interim city manager of Talent, Oregon after a devastating forest fire for city recovery. Now she is also an emergency preparedness coordinator for Oregon's Department of Human Services.</p><p>\"Throughout the conversations I've had in the stumps and with voters, we are in a time of crisis: Working families trying to get back on their feet, post-COVID, our climate where our homes are literally burning down, the end of democracy,\" McLeod-Skinner said \"But we are also in a time of hope. If we create, establish and work together towards a shared vision of moving forward, then it is a time of hope.\"</p><p>Leaderboard 2</p><p>McLeod-Skinner attributed part of her success as a rural Democrat to recent changes to the boundaries of Oregon's 5th district, including the addition of Central Deschutes County where McLeod-Skinner outperformed by 9400 votes.</p><p>\"[In 2018] I traveled the equivalent of 15 times across our country, just throughout Oregon, showing up and meeting with folks especially in rural areas,\" McLeod-Skinner said. \"So I have a real brand and reputation of showing up, listening and connecting with rural folks, being a rural Democrat myself and really building up a strong base.\"</p><p>While Schrader has been facing criticism from progressive Democrats as too conservative, major media narratives ascribe McLeod-Skinner's success to her progressive approach.</p><p>Newsletter Signup</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; width:100%;} /* Add your own Mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.

McLeod-Skinner rejects the claim and regards it as the framing that her opponent used. She says she is just working on the fundamental things Oregonians want, regardless of party affiliations or progressive levels. Providing affordable healthcare is one of them. \"In talking to conservative Republicans in the most rural parts of Oregon, people are talking about wanting health care for their families, wanting to make sure they can afford it,\" McLeod-Skinner said, \"... I even talked to moderates, moderates want reasonable drug prices. Conservatives, and independents want reasonable drug prices. That's not an R&amp;D issue. That's not even a progressive versus a moderate type issue within the party.\" Looking back on her time at Cornell, McLeod-Skinner thinks the University gave her the confidence to make decisions and find solutions, as she came out of a rural background. She discovered the possibility of connecting her transition from Cornell to the power structure to her humble roots and representation of working people. \"Hillary Clinton came to speak on campus back then; the Attorney General, Janet Reno, I heard her speak, and it was very influential. Also, my professors talked about the theory of politics and the individual perspectives that people had,\" McLeod-Skinner said. McLeod-Skinner will face Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer in the November general election. \"I'm running against someone who is very regressive, dog whistling and has very extremist views that are so unhealthy and will break what we have,\" McLeod-Skinner said. \"And that's why I've got this grassroots support, because it's really the sense of bringing people together and a positive focus on the future.\"</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5351051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664N-RKG1-JBSN-33X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cornell Daily Sun: Cornell University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Ithaca</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;
