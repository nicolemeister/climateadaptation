I`m Norah O`Donnell, and thank you for being with us.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris is on the cusp of getting an endorsement from one of the biggest names in American politics. We will get to that in just a moment.</p><p>But we do want to start with the breaking news about a major wildfire in California, the incredible pictures just coming in, showing intense flames devouring buildings, cars, anything in its way near Chico. That is north of Sacramento.</p><p>And, tonight, investigators say all of this destruction was caused by a suspected arsonist who has now been charged with causing the state`s largest wildfire so far this year.</p><p>CBS` Jonathan Vigliotti is in Northern California and spoke to a woman who saw how it all began.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI (voiceover): In Northern California, this wildfire pushed by powerful winds ripped through a community near the city of Chico.</p><p>As thousands evacuated, the fire engulfed everything in its path, leaving a trail of devastation.</p><p>Julia Yarbo (sp?) watched her house burn on her home security camera. We were with her as she returned for the first time.</p><p>JULIA YARBO (Fire Victim): You know, we`re just -- we`re shell-shocked right now. It really is surreal.</p><p>JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: This time-lapse video shows the fire`s astonishing growth, starting small, growing into the evening, and, overnight, exploding, first to 45,000, and now more than 70,000 acres, all in less than 24 hours. It`s by far California`s largest wildfire this year.</p><p>And investigators arrested a 42-year-old man on suspicion of arson. Witnesses say they saw him with his car already burning in a ditch.</p><p>ALLISON EHRESMAN (Eyewitness): And then he got out of the car, kind of looked at it. When I turned back, he was gone.</p><p>JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And in Western Canada, a massive forest fire is now burning in British Columbia, while, in Alberta, the tourist town of Jasper has suffered what authorities call a significant loss.</p><p>Back in California, life went from normal to heartbreak in an instant.</p><p>What does home mean to you now?</p><p>JULIA YARBO: I think home really means the -- the people that you care about, and who cares about you.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JONATHAN VIGLIOTTI: And, tonight, more than a dozen homes look like this one, charred down to their foundation; 1,100 firefighters are now battling this blaze, and for good reason.</p><p>We`re just 14 miles away from the town of Paradise, which was destroyed by fire in 2018, Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Hmm. Jonathan Vigliotti, thank you so much.</p><p>Turning now to a consequential day on the campaign trail. CBS News has learned Barack Obama is planning on backing Vice President Kamala Harris -- quote -- \"soon.\" That`s according to a source, who also says Obama has been in regular touch with Harris, and believes the vice president is off to an impressive start.</p><p>There`s a new national poll that`s out today that has Harris significantly narrowing what had been a Trump lead, with Trump now ahead by just one point. That`s among likely voters.</p><p>And, as CBS` Robert Costa reports, both candidates are sharpening their attacks.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ROBERT COSTA (voiceover): Vice President Harris back on the trail today in Houston rallying educators at the American Federation of Teachers.</p><p>KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate): Donald Trump and his allies want to cut Medicare and Social Security --</p><p>(Crowd booing)</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: -- to stop student loan forgiveness for teachers and other public servants.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: In the near future, former President Obama`s expected nod, which sources say has been held out of respect for President Biden and his Oval Office address last night, will come as Harris is working fast to define her message on her terms before former President Trump and Republicans do it on theirs.</p><p>(Clip from campaign ad)</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. We choose freedom.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: Harris says she`s ready to rumble on the debate stage.</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes, I`m ready to debate Donald Trump. Now it appears he`s backpedaling, but I`m ready.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: Today, Trump advisers told CBS News Trump is ready and willing to have several debates with Harris.</p><p>Meanwhile, the vice president is pushing to focus her campaign speeches on policies she champions as part of the Biden administration, such as reproductive rights and gun control.</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We want to ban assault weapons, and they want to ban books.</p><p>(Crowd booing)</p><p>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Can you imagine?</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: But a bruising political battle is ahead, as Trump casts her as a liberal Democrat who`s out of step on the border, abortion, health care and the economy.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): She`s worse than him, because he`s a fake liberal. You know, he wasn`t that liberal. He was fake. She`s a real liberal.</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on Harris` decision on a running mate, with more than a dozen names being considered, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.</p><p>SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): It`s not about me, but I have always, I mean, always, when I have had the -- you know, the chance to serve, I think that`s very important to do.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>ROBERT COSTA: Top Democrats privately tell me Senator Kelly is near the top of the list because they believe he comes from a key state. Plus, they say his service in the Navy and at NASA would square up well against Senator J.D. Vance, a Marine veteran -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: All right, Robert Costa, thank you very much.</p><p>And there`s breaking news tonight. The vice president has just wrapped up her first high-stakes meeting with a world leader since launching her campaign for president. She met one-on-one with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following his meeting with President Biden.</p><p>CBS` Weijia Jiang has new details tonight on a busy and important day at the White House.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): We got a lot to talk about.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG (voiceover): In their private meeting, President Biden pressured Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to accept the latest cease-fire and hostage release deal, a top priority for Biden in the last six months of his term.</p><p>PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: The White House believes it is on the brink of brokering an agreement.</p><p>JOHN KIRBY (NSC Coordinator For Strategic Communications): We are closer now, we believe, than we have been before.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: Promising words for the family members of hostages who met with the two leaders in private.</p><p>MAN: They understand the urgency of this moment now to waste no time.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: Three Israeli-American hostages died in Hamas custody. Five others are unaccounted for, including 22-year-old Omer Neutra.</p><p>RONEN NEUTRA (Father of Israeli-American Hostage Omer Neutra): The urgency, and we expressed it multiple times today to both leaders, it`s -- it`s so critical that everything will be done as if there`s no tomorrow.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: Biden has grown increasingly frustrated with Netanyahu`s handling of the conflict and inability to make a deal.</p><p>PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What I will tell you is, I think what he`s doing is a mistake.</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: The prime minister has been criticized for focusing more on wiping out Hamas than freeing the hostages. Nearly 10 months of war has left almost 40,000 killed and about half-a-million people facing catastrophic hunger levels in Gaza.</p><p>The likely Democratic nominee also met with Netanyahu late today.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>WEIJIA JIANG: Tonight, Harris said that Israel has the right to defend itself and how it does so matters, referring to the tens of thousands who have lost their lives in the war.</p><p>Netanyahu will also meet with her likely opponent, Donald Trump, tomorrow at Mar-a-Lago -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Weijia Jiang at the White House, thank you.</p><p>Tonight, new video shows police gaining access to the rooftop where a gunman fired on former President Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p><p>CBS` Scott MacFarlane reports tonight on questions being raised about whether Trump was in fact hit by a bullet in the ear.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE (voiceover): Newly released police video shows a local Pennsylvania SWAT team trying to find a way to the roof used by the gunman who tried to kill former President Donald Trump.</p><p>MAN #1: There`s a ladder right here.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: Seeking a ladder, then climbing.</p><p>One responder is heard noting:</p><p>MAN #2: He was on a roof outside of the fence line.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: Finding the trail of shell casings.</p><p>MAN #3: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. At least eight.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: And the AR-style rifle near the shooter`s body, then a suspected detonator.</p><p>MAN #4: It is a remote-controlled device. It`s gray in color.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: Pennsylvania Republican Dan Meuser, who was near Trump during the rally, says he wants more answers about the response.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DAN MEUSER (R-Pennsylvania): I don`t think there was a high sense of seriousness and urgency, frankly.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: Meanwhile, a day after FBI Director Christopher Wray raised questions about whether Trump was actually hit by a bullet --</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WRAY (FBI Director): There`s some question about whether or not it`s a bullet or shrapnel that -- you know, that hit his ear.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: -- Democrats pounced.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE DANIEL GOLDMAN (D-New York): And if he`s lying about whether he was actually shot, that`s something that the American people should know.</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: The only medical statement released about Trump`s injury wasn`t from the hospital that treated him, but by his political ally and former White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who today defended his argument it was a bullet.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE RONNY JACKSON (R-Texas): If it wasn`t a bullet wound, I ask you, what was it, right? Piece of glass? Where`d the glass come from? I have -- I have been told the teleprompters are completely intact.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>SCOTT MACFARLANE: Trump called for the FBI director`s resignation after Christopher Wray raised that question about the bullet.</p><p>The FBI in a statement of CBS News says it is devoting enormous resources to learning everything possible about the shooter -- Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Scott MacFarlane, thank you.</p><p>Now a look at tonight`s other top stories, starting with security at the Olympics. The Games begin tomorrow, but French police have already arrested multiple people they say were planning violent terrorist acts.</p><p>CBS` Dana Jacobson is in Paris.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>DANA JACOBSON: The normally bustling streets of Paris, as you can see, relatively barren and barricaded, as security forces lock down this area around the River Seine. A near four-mile stretch of it will serve as the site of tomorrow`s Opening Ceremony. And, Norah, that means, if you want to get in, you`re going to need a Q.R. code or a credential.</p><p>DANA JACOBSON (voiceover): More than 45,000 police and military have been deployed to keep the Olympic kickoff safe. And with more than 10,000 athletes competing and millions of fans attending the Games, securing the Olympics has been a top priority.</p><p>MAN: It`s impossible to annihilate risks, but what the authorities have been trying to do is to minimize those threats.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Now to California, where the state`s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, issued an executive order today instructing local officials to clear thousands of homeless encampments across the state.</p><p>CBS` Elise Preston is in Los Angeles.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ELISE PRESTON: More than 120,000 people live without shelter on sidewalks and streets here in California. Norah, that`s nearly half of the country`s unsheltered population just here in this state alone.</p><p>ELISE PRESTON (voiceover): This order directs state agencies on how to remove homeless encampments, but it`s up to local authorities to take action.</p><p>GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM (D-California): There are no longer any excuses. A billion dollars, this state has invested to support communities to clean up these encampments.</p><p>ELISE PRESTON: Newsom called the situation a crisis. This order comes a month after the Supreme Court ruled to allow cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public places.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: And Southwest Airlines announced some big changes today, including getting rid of one of its offerings known for polarizing passengers.</p><p>Here`s CBS` Kris Van Cleave with the details.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: This is a big change. Southwest is about to break with more than 50 years of tradition, Norah, and soon will dump its open seating policy.</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE (voiceover): Going to assigned seating allows Southwest to add extra legroom seating to its planes, something it will be able to charge a premium for. The airline has struggled post-pandemic and is under intense pressure to increase revenue.</p><p>BOB JORDAN (CEO, Southwest Airlines): Eighty percent of customers that fly Southwest today want an assigned seat; 86 percent of customers that don`t fly Southwest want an assigned seat. And when a customer defects from Southwest to another competitor, it`s the number one reason.</p><p>KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Southwest will also start flying overnight red-eyes for the first time next year.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Big changes ahead, and thanks to our CBS News teams around the globe.</p><p>Young people are getting excited about this election, and they could decide the outcome. That story`s next.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: The youth vote is suddenly being energized across the country thanks to a new front-runner at the top of the Democratic ticket and the 39-year-old Republican V.P. pick.</p><p>CBS` Jo Ling Kent takes a look at the generation that could decide who wins in November.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>JO LING KENT (voiceover): Vice President Kamala Harris and Senator J.D. Vance are bringing down the age range in the final stretch of this race. And young voters appear to be shifting their support.</p><p>DOV FACTOR (Young Voter): Kamala has a different kind of in, in pop culture than other candidates, and I think that my generation really responds to that.</p><p>JO LING KENT: In the latest \"New York Times\"/Siena poll, 59 percent of voters under 30 now support Harris, leading former President Trump by more than 20 percentage points.</p><p>Today, Harris` new campaign video featuring a Beyonce song went viral.</p><p>(Clip from Kamala Harris campaign video)</p><p>JO LING KENT: As many users embrace fan-generated memes and remixes of Harris online, like Project Coconut.</p><p>KAMALA HARRIS (D-Vice President of the United States and U.S. Presidential Candidate): You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?</p><p>JO LING KENT: And \"Kamala is brat,\" giving the campaign a wider reach across social media.</p><p>ANTONELLA CARLINI (Young Voter): Yes, a lot of remixes to, like, Charli XCX, coconut. Yes, I like those. Those make me fun, excited.</p><p>MAN: I feel extremely energized.</p><p>JO LING KENT: Meantime, former President Donald Trump`s running mate, Vance, is the first millennial ever on a presidential ticket.</p><p>SENATOR J.D. VANCE (R-Ohio) (Vice Presidential Candidate): Joe Biden has been a politician in Washington for longer than I have been alive, 39 years old.</p><p>Kamala Harris is not much further behind.</p><p>JO LING KENT: And what happens online is expected to inform how young voters make their decision come November.</p><p>LUCILLE WENEGIEME (Executive Director, HeadCount): It`s less about what the specific campaigns are putting out. It is very much what resonates with young people and them making it their own.</p><p>(End VT) JO LING KENT: And new tonight, Vice President Harris has officially joined TikTok herself with a new video acknowledging what`s been happening on social.</p><p>But, as we all know, memes can turn quickly. It doesn`t always translate to votes. We have still got more than 100 days until Election Day, Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Young voters get their information in different places.</p><p>Jo Ling Kent, thank you so much.</p><p>JO LING KENT: Thanks, Norah.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Eye on America is next. As our problem with garbage continues to grow, we will show you how one city is fighting back.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: If you can`t watch the CBS EVENING NEWS, you can listen, subscribe wherever you get your podcast.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: In tonight`s Eye on America, we want to talk about trash.</p><p>The amount of garbage in the U.S. has exploded, nearly doubling since 1980. And it`s significantly affecting the quality of life in American cities.</p><p>CBS` Mark Strassmann shows us what one major city is doing about it.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ (Supervisor): Looks like construction debris, some household stuff.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN (voiceover): In someone`s bags of dumped trash...</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ: You smell that?</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: ... Ramses Alvarez`s team just found their treasure.</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ: It looks like some W-2s.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: A name with an address.</p><p>What you`re doing here, though, is building a case.</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ: Yes. This is our evidence.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: San Francisco`s like much of America, blighted by litter. Alvarez supervises these public works employees. Think of them as trash detectives, rooting through mounds of rubbish, block by block, bag by bag, trying to tie the trash to the trasher.</p><p>What`d you find?</p><p>WOMAN #1: It`s like credit card applications.</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ: It happens 24/7, 365. There`s always illegal dumping in the city.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Surveillance video shows this guy unloading his truck onto the sidewalk. Fines can hit $1,000.</p><p>The goal of the program is more than just cleanup. It`s accountability.</p><p>RAMSES ALVAREZ: Yes. It`s not OK to use the city as your trash can.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Talking trash nationally, there are an estimated 50 billion pieces of litter lying around on U.S. roads and waterways. That comes out to roughly 150 pieces of litter for every person living in this country.</p><p>DAVID SPIEGEL (Stanford University School of Medicine): A trashed environment sends a powerful message, and it`s not a pleasant one psychologically or socially or physically.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: David Spiegel, a psychiatry professor at Stanford, says the trashing of America, images like this, breeds social isolation.</p><p>DAVID SPIEGEL: Social isolation is bad for your mental health. It`s bad for your physical health, and they have actually linked it to depression.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: San Francisco alone generates 5,000 tons of trash a day. Recology, one of the city`s waste disposal companies, collects and separates most of it into three categories, landfill, recycling and compost sold to fertilize nearby farms.</p><p>But 18,000 tons of trash a year gets dumped on city streets.</p><p>You walk out here every day.</p><p>JOFFREY SIMPSON (San Francisco Resident): Man, and -- and it`s going to be garbage.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Joffrey Simpson lives on this corner. It`s one of 30 hot spots for dumping just in this one neighborhood.</p><p>Who is doing this? Do you know?</p><p>JOFFREY SIMPSON: Man, I wouldn`t know, man.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Yes. But it ticks you off?</p><p>JOFFREY SIMPSON: Constantly.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: In a 2024 LawnStarter survey of America`s dirtiest cities, New York City`s living conditions came out first, which means worst, San Francisco second, Jersey city third.</p><p>WOMAN #2: He`s calling our packer truck.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: In San Francisco, many people dump to dodge trash collection fees paid by most owners and renters here.</p><p>ROBERT REED (Recology): We want to recycle and compost as much as possible.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: Recology`s Robert Reed has this reminder: Do your part.</p><p>ROBERT REED: We all generate garbage. We all have a personal responsibility to take care of it, to put it in the right place.</p><p>WOMAN #1: These people are good.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: In this trash, no leads, all the personal mail torn to pieces.</p><p>So that person`s getting away with it?</p><p>WOMAN #1: Yes, until next time.</p><p>MARK STRASSMANN: And next time could be right around the corner.</p><p>For Eye on America, Mark Strassmann in San Francisco.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: A member of Congress delivers a historic speech from the House floor without speaking a word.</p><p>We will explain. That`s next.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Finally, tonight`s Heart of America.</p><p>Virginia Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton made history today, delivering what is believed to be the first speech from the House floor using a voice cloned by artificial intelligence. She was diagnosed last year with a rare neurological disorder that robbed her of the ability to speak clearly.</p><p>Wexton and her team spent weeks compiling clips of her previous speeches to generate an A.I. model of her voice. Today, she used her time to advocate for people living with disabilities and to honor the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>A.I.-GENERATED VOICE OF REPRESENTATIVE JENNIFER WEXTON (D-Virginia): I hope I can be a voice, even an A.I. voice, for Americans facing accessibility challenges and other disabilities, because, too often, people only see us for that disability. And, in truth, we are so much more.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Such an important message.</p><p>Representative Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, tonight`s Heart of America.</p><p>And that is tonight`s CBS EVENING NEWS.

Similarly, e-Gastu an Android based platform captures forest patrolling/field activities undertaken by frontline staff of the forest department, which can be visualized by supervisory officers over satellite imageries, on regular basis. Likewise, e-timber facility provides a near real time wood stock available in government timber depots and enables e-auction facilities for timber/ other forest produce in government timber depots. The Geo-Spatial Forest Information System developed by the Karnataka Forest Department is a unique platform which uses Remote Sensing and GIS technology and provides spatial database of all notified forest lands in the State, providing access to the forest land notifications, village maps, forest maps and digitised notified forest at cadastral level. The Forest Fire Management System is a comprehensive solution for planning, mitigation and analysis of forest fire which provides forest fire risk zonation mapping, fire start vulnerability mapping, burnt area assessment along with a robust system for dissemination of active forest fire alerts to ensure that all fire incidences are addressed and mitigated in a time bound manner.</p><p>The G20 delegates are scheduled to visit the Kalkere Arboretum and Bannerghatta Biological Park at Bengaluru.

Jaime Herrera Beutler announced Thursday that she raised more than $152,000 in her first month running for state commissioner of public lands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Herrera Beutler, the amount is twice as much as the previous record a candidate for public lands commissioner has raised in their first month on the campaign trail.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Republican, Herrera Beutler announced her candidacy for the statewide office on Oct. 10.</p><p>\"I talk about the need to manage public lands to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire everywhere I go, and people are responding,\" Herrera Beutler said in a statement. \"We will protect our lands and waters for all Washingtonians to enjoy.\"</p><p>According to data from the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC), state Sen. Kevin Van De Wege, D-Lake Sutherland, raised the second most in the race, bringing in nearly $130,000 since he announced his candidacy for the position in June.</p><p>According to Herrera Beutler, 85% of her funding comes from individual donors, with 9% coming from businesses and 6% from political action committees.</p><p>\"This is a grassroots campaign, meaning the residents of Washington are the ones behind this swelling momentum,\" campaign manager Pam Peiper said in a statement. \"We're honored that so many people from all around the state are investing their time and money in our cause.\"</p><p>Herrera Beutler represented Southwest Washington in the House of Representatives for 12 years before falling to challenger Joe Kent in the August 2022 primary. Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez ended up winning election the following November.</p><p>Following her announcement of a campaign to serve as public lands commissioner, Herrera Beutler told The Chronicle the position would allow her to work with conservation groups, landowners and representatives from the timber and sports industries across the state.</p><p>\"We're raising our family in the path of the Yacolt Burn, which stood for over a century as the largest forest fire in Washington state history,\" Herrera Beutler said in an interview with The Chronicle in October. \"In just the past decade, that terrible record has already been surpassed three times. I won't leave my kids a legacy of burning forests and choking smoke. We can and will do better.\"</p><p>Herrera Beutler is running to replace current Lands Commissioner Hilary Franz, who previously announced she would not seek reelection.</p><p>Franz initially launched a candidacy for governor, though she ended that campaign Friday and announced a bid for Washington's Sixth Congressional District.</p><p>The move came after current U.S. Rep. Democrat Derek Kilmer announced Thursday he wouldn't seek reelection.</p><p>In addition to Herrera Beutler and Van De Wege, five other candidates have announced campaigns to serve as public lands commissioner, according to the PDC.

Driving the couple to safety would be a federal crime, and his volunteer group had been warned by agents that arrest and seizure of their vehicles were potential consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the end, rescuing a vulnerable, expectant mother outweighed everything else.</p><p>\"The idea of leaving her out along the wall was just impossible,\" Nixon, told CNN. He feared the woman could go into labor at any moment.</p><p>He helped the parents-to-be into a four-wheel-drive vehicle and headed to a makeshift migrant camp several miles away - where migrants can find water and snacks while they wait for the Border Patrol agents to transport them for immigration processing.</p><p>Nixon and his wife Laurel Grindy, two retired teachers in their 70s, belong to a group called the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gvs-samaritans.org/\">Green Valley-Sahuarita Samaritans</url>, that helps migrants in distress in what is currently the busiest migrant crossing on the US southern border which - perhaps surprisingly to some - is in Arizona, not Texas.</p><p>Federal agents in the Tucson Border Patrol Sector have apprehended about 300,000 migrants from October to February, according to Customs and Border Protection data.</p><p>That's about 64% more than the number of migrant apprehensions in the Del Rio Border Patrol Sector, which includes Eagle Pass, Texas - the epicenter of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/us-mexico-border-texas-military/index.html\">ongoing battle over border security</url> between Texas and the Biden administration.</p><p>At the current pace, migrant apprehensions in southern Arizona could reach 800,000 this fiscal year, John Modlin, the head of the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector, told CNN. Modlin's staggering projection nears the total number of migrant encounters in the sector for the past three fiscal years combined.</p><p>On a recent visit by CNN to this migrant crossing hotspot, just about everyone we encountered had been impacted by the steady flow of people crossing into remote areas of mountainous desert - and struggled to live up to their personal and professional ideals of service, compassion and duty.</p><p>'We're not smuggling anybody'</p><p>We tagged along with Nixon and Grindy as they drove up and down the same steep road where they had found the pregnant Mexican woman more than a month prior. Their SUV was packed with water, apples, oranges, string cheese and boiled eggs.</p><p>Eggs are a popular treat for migrants who haven't had a real meal in days, Grindy said.</p><p>The first stop was the makeshift migrant camp where Border Patrol agents picked up the Mexican couple hours after Nixon had made the risky, split-second decision to transport them to a safe location.</p><p>But as they turned into the camp, they noticed a sign posted by the entrance that read, \"Transportation of undocumented non-citizens is a federal crime pursuant 8 USC 1324.\"</p><p>It's a crime, punishable with prison time, to knowingly transport or move a person who entered or is in the US illegally, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1324&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim\">the statute</url>.</p><p>\"We're not smuggling anybody,\" Nixon said. \"We're old people. We don't want to spend our last days in jail.\"</p><p>Nixon was thinking of the vulnerable women, children, and the infirm from all over the world he's witnessed trekking the steep hills in flip-flops or inadequate shoes, he said.</p><p>The signs were posted by the Tucson Border Patrol Sector to remind the community the transportation of migrants is a felony under federal law, according to a CBP official. It's Border Patrol's way of urging volunteers who work in the area to leave the transportation of migrants to law enforcement, the official said.</p><p>Nixon now carries a letter, which he shared with CNN, from the volunteer group's attorney stating he is not breaking the law by transporting vulnerable people and instead is saving lives and mitigating human suffering. It's unclear if the document would have any legal standing. Nixon says the letter is a way to articulate to law enforcement that he believes his behavior is legal because he is aiding the vulnerable.</p><p>'Our ranch could go up in flames'</p><p>With his hand on the steering wheel, Nixon pointed to the portion of the border wall in front of the camp and said volunteers called the area \"Little Havana,\" because groups of Cubans crossed at some point and the name stuck.</p><p>But the property where the camp is located is technically called \"Tres Bellotas Ranch\" and it's owned by cattle rancher Lori Lindsay.</p><p>Lindsay is a descendant of Italian immigrants who sympathizes with migrants who have skirted the border wall and end up in the camp looking for respite.</p><p>On cold nights, when the temperature dips into the 20s, the plastic tarps and tents on her land are the only things protecting women and children from the ruthless elements.</p><p>But she worries about disease spreading because there are no restroom facilities or running water. And the nightmare scenario is even worse - that her generosity could cost her everything.</p><p>Migrants trying to keep warm started making fires in the camp, even under mesquite trees, and she fears a forest fire could spread - especially given an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.drought.gov/states/arizona\">ongoing drought</url> and dry desert conditions.</p><p>\"It's not just our ranch that could go up in flames, the whole Coronado (National) Forest could go up in flames,\" Lindsay told CNN.</p><p>\"This is our livelihood ... Other people walk away. This is our home,\" she said.</p><p>'What keeps me up at night'</p><p>Lindsay's cattle ranch and the border road traveled by volunteers like Nixon are all under the close eye of the Border Patrol, the federal law enforcement agency that's tasked with detecting and preventing the illegal entry of people into the United States.</p><p>One day last week, we joined Brett Howard, a helicopter pilot and air interdiction agent with Air and Marine Operations - a branch of Customs and Border Protection - on a helicopter patrol of the border. He looked at the horizon and said in his 20 years with the agency he had interdicted migrants or drugs in every square mile as far as his eyes could see.</p><p>The jagged peaks, peppered with saguaro cacti, tower over deep valleys covered in bright yellow poppies. Several generations of border wall cut through the area - with older barriers blending in with the vegetation, and newer structures shooting up toward the sky like the spine of a giant beast resting on the steep mountains<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis></p><p>Smuggling organizations cross thousands of migrants in some of the most remote areas in the east side of Arizona, where Nixon and Grindy volunteer, all while these same groups smuggle narcotics and bad guys on the west side, according to Modlin, of the Tucson Border Patrol Sector.</p><p>The smuggler's scheme bogs down Modlin's agents on the east side, in what he calls a \"humanitarian mission,\" all while the team's guard is down on the west side.</p><p>Since October, Modlin's team has detected 30,000 \"gottaways,\" or individuals who have entered the country illegally but were not apprehended due to lack of personnel and resources, he said.</p><p>\"That is absolutely what keeps me up at night,\" Modlin said. He warns that \"gottaways\" could have criminal histories, be trafficking narcotics or have ill intent towards the United States.</p><p>Howard hovered around the giant peaks of the Baboquivari Mountains and pointed at the smuggling trails that curl around colossal rocks. From the air, the scene looks like a death sentence for anyone without the proper training and gear.</p><p>\"The extent that migrants and smugglers will go ... in order to not be detected, that's what blows my mind,\" Howard told CNN.         </p><p>             By Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Fire has been burning about 60 miles away from my home and ash is raining down even on my front porch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having lived in the Pacific Northwest for almost 19 of my nearly 20 years of life, I am no stranger to fire danger. There were fires every summer that I can remember. My local news channels always spoke about them, but it was rare to hear anything about it on the national news.</p><p>The good thing about the fires that I had experienced during my childhood is that they were never that close to my home. The closest a wildfire ever got to my home was about 80 miles away, but even that fire seemed like a world away.</p><p>In 2015 there was a fire in Pemberton, British Columbia that was so smokey, my corner of southwest Washington was filled to the brim with haze. Again, I didn't have a care in the world about it. Many of the people I went to school with were even making jokes, saying, \"we get it Vancouver, you vape.\"</p><p>It took another two years and 3,000 miles for me to finally understand: fires are terrifying and unpredictable. For all I know, the current blaze in Eagle Creek, Oregon could be at my house tomorrow. You don't realize just how impactful natural disasters are until they're practically at your doorstep.</p><p>When I was much younger, I was so excited to meet Smokey the Bear because he was a celebrity during that time of my life. The day I finally met him, he gave me a badge and said I was one of the many who could prevent forest fires.</p><p>I'm sorry Smokey, today I can't.</p><p>The people who instigated this forest fire were from my hometown. Young teenagers decided it would be a good idea to throw a smoke bomb down an embankment in 103 degree weather during one of the driest times of the year.</p><p>The fire has burned 35,000 acres, jumped across the river from Oregon to Washington, merged with another fire, destroyed beloved natural wonders, and is still only 13 percent contained. The air quality has been so poor that it has been claimed to be even worse than that of Beijing.</p><p>Many of the scenic landmarks Oregon and Washington are known for are now believed to be destroyed. Multnomah Falls, one of the premier attractions in Oregon, was engulfed. While the clubhouse was saved, the scenery around the waterfall has been destroyed. Bridal Veil, one of the most popular wedding destinations in all of the Northwest, has likely been burned to the ground. Oneonta Tunnel leading back into the hidden waterfall is expected to be gone. Many of the areas in the Northwest depicted in beautiful photos on social media are now gone.</p><p>That's not to mention the destruction to wildlife. A hatchery trying to restore the population of Chinook salmon was forced to release 600,000 fish months before they were ready. Ranches have been evacuated. I can't even go on Facebook without seeing someone offering up space and/or time to house others' horses.</p><p>I remember the trips down the scenic Columbia River Gorge with my family as we drove to who-knows-where to go camping. Whether I was five or 18, I would always stare out the window. I would take in the beauty of the area: trees cascading down the mountains, the rolling foothills, the beautiful river...now most of it is gone.</p><p>With all the devastation raining down upon the United States in the form of natural disasters, I am now one of the many students who sit and watch helplessly as their hometowns are threatened by events out of their control.</p><p>From Hurricane Harvey weakening the great state of Texas, to the blazing fires in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Montana, and even Hurricane Irma recently bulldozing through Florida and the Caribbean, everybody seems to be experiencing their fair share of natural disaster lately.</p><p>However, the fires raining down in the Pacific Northwest have hardly been covered in the news media.</p><p>Kaitlin Pataroque, a third-year student from the Portland, Oregon area, said, \"It's been kind of hard that it seems like the fire isn't getting much coverage. I know that there are a lot of other big current events going on right now, but it seems like a lot of people have been turning their face[s].\"</p><p>Until I brought up the devastation to friends, only one had heard about the fire. It's not just the Eagle Creek fire that isn't getting media attention either. Montana recently declared a state of emergency because fires have burned more than 1,000,000 acres of land this summer. Wildfires are also burning in northern Washington, central Oregon, Idaho and northern California. But it seems the majority of the United States remains unaware.</p><p>These events deserve attention too. Wildfires destroy homes just like hurricanes do. Wildfires take lives just like hurricanes do. Wildfires kill wildlife just like hurricanes do. These events deserve attention too, yet rarely are they covered on national television. The majority of the coverage of fires comes from local media. CNN, The New Yorker and The Washington Post are the only major networks that have discussed the devastation from the Eagle Creek fire. There has only been some very limited coverage on national television. Meanwhile, Harvey and Irma remain some of the top news stories.</p><p>Wildfires are disastrous events often caused by drought, high temperatures and lightning, all things people can't help, yet which receive little to no media attention. I get that we live in the Midwest, but these events deserve attention just like any other natural disaster.</p><p>It's time to stop turning a blind eye to the natural disasters of the West Coast. That side of America is just as important as the East Coast. We have a large population, we have industry, we have a large network of trade, and yet the area is hardly discussed. As a child I would become giddy when they mentioned Washington State on a television broadcast. That's how rare it is.</p><p>It is time for this nation to pay attention to all parts of the country. The West Coast does exist, and it's time to start recognizing that in the national news broadcasts.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>rants and raves</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5730969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BD5-HWH1-JBSN-31JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer: Case Western Reserve University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 23, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008BSO</classCode><className>EAGLE CREEK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS316990 OTHER LEATHER AND ALLIED PRODUCT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC3161 LUGGAGE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Cleveland</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>OH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Because they are able to metabolically process PAHs, these are most likely recent exposures. Orcas are our canary in the coal mine for oceans, telling us how healthy our waters are,\" said senior author Dr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava, principal investigator of the UBC Ocean Pollution Research Unit and adjunct professor at Simon Fraser University.</p><p>PAHs are a type of chemical found in coal, oil and gasoline which research suggests are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and have toxic effects on mammals. Their presence in the ocean comes from several sources, including oil spills, burning coal and forest fire smoke particles.</p><p>Researchers analyzed muscle and liver samples from six Bigg's, or transient, killer whales and six Southern Resident killer whales (SRKWs) stranded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean between 2006 and 2018. They tested for 76 PAHs and found some in all samples, with half the PAHs appearing in at least 50 per cent of the samples. One compound, a PAH derivative called C3-phenanthrenes/anthracenes, accounted for 33 per cent of total contamination across all samples. These forms of PAHs, known as alkylated PAHs, are known to be more persistent, toxic, and to accumulate more in the bodies of organisms or animals than parental PAHs.</p><p>No one has studied PAHs in killer whales in B.C. before. However, the researchers noted the average level of contamination in their study was lower than previous studies of cetaceans in the Gulf of California, and almost two times higher than that found in blood samples of captive killer whales from Icelandic waters.</p><p>SRKW contaminants largely from human emissions</p><p>The contaminants in Bigg's killer whales were mostly those produced by burning coal and vegetation, as well as forest fires. In SRKWs, they were the kind produced by oil spills and burning of fossil fuels like gasoline. The researchers say this could be due to the animals' differing habitats. Bigg's killer whales range from California to southeastern Alaska and into the North Pacific Ocean, while SRKWs stay closer to more polluted urban environments around the Salish Sea.</p><p>Feeding preferences, behaviour and metabolism could also impact the amount of contaminants accumulating in the animals.</p><p>\"B.C.'s coast is experiencing oil pipeline developments, oil tanker traffic, industrial effluents, forest fires, stormwater runoff and wastewater,\" said first author Kiah Lee, who conducted the work as an undergraduate student at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries (IOF) and is now a masters student at the University of Oslo. \"These activities put toxic PAHs into the marine food web and, as we saw here, they can be found in orcas, the apex predator.\"</p><p>Improve pollution management</p><p>\"There's only a small population to draw from-74 individuals in the case of the Southern Residents,\" said co-author Dr. Stephen Raverty, IOF adjunct professor and veterinary pathologist with the B.C. Ministry of Agriculture and Food. \"There are many potential causes for their decline, pollution being one.\"</p><p>One of the whales examined was 'Luna', an orca separated from his mother as a calf who had extensive human contact and lived in variable habitats, which may be why Luna showed a mixture of hydrocarbon contaminants.</p><p>\"The preliminary findings from this study will add key information to inform management approaches in killer whale habitats,\" said Paul Cottrell of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. \"The source of the PAHs is often from human activity and it is important we have baseline data on current PAH levels in killer whales to monitor those trends and impacts in marine ecosystems into the future.\"</p><p>Ultimately, humans need to reduce and eventually eliminate fossil fuel consumption to help combat climate change and conserve marine biodiversity, said Dr. Alava. \"This would also serve to bolster the resilience and health of marine ecosystems, benefiting communities that rely on them such as coastal First Nations peoples as well as future generations.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-165106718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69X8-CFX1-JDJN-64GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 20, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Admiralty &amp;

According to news reporting from Nnamdi Azikiwe University by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"This study evaluated the potential of compost-combusted forest litters as alternative sources of ex-situ organo-mineral products to the direct use of controlled fire for enhanced soil nutrients in forest stands.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nnamdi Azikiwe University: \"Floor litters from six (6) delineated standing forest patches of Pterocarpus erinaceus, Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis, Bambusa vulgaris, Ceiba pentandra and Mangifera indica were characterized for N, K, P, Ca and Mg; composted for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days and then uniformly combusted to produce organo-minerals for early growth response of Dacryodes edulis in a 6 x 4 split-plot factorial experiment. Analysis of variance was conducted for litter characteristics, calorific values, moisture, ash contents, and germination and growth variables of Dacryodes edulis while significant means were separated with DMRT (p 0.05). Results showed that Mangifera had the highest P (0.68%) and K (1.15%); Bamboo had the highest N (1.92%). Germination was 6&gt;9&gt;12&gt; 3 days with Bamboo &gt; Ceiba &gt; Teak &gt; Mangifera &gt; Gmelina &gt; Pterocarpus for 6 days organo-minerals, but the highest height (21.56 \u00b1 6.77 cm) by Pterocarpus to implicate litters under microbe-thermal mediation as sustainable organo-mineral ex-situ products to combat incidence of forest fire for fertile forest soil.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Thus, in-situ controlled fire in standing forests is no longer needed for nutrient-rich forest-agriculture.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Evaluation of organo-mineral qualities of combusted compost floor litters in Achalla forest reserve on early growth responses of Dacryodes edulis H.

Here are the main takeaways from the two proposals.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clashing over conservation funds</emphasis></h><p>In their proposals, both Republicans and Democrats emphasize the importance of getting more money into the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) highly popular \u2014 and brutally oversubscribed \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives\">conservation programs</url>.</p><p>Programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program help farmers pay for a broad range of projects \u2014 from cover cropping and brush control to prescribed burns \u2014 that help maintain soil and water health.</p><p>Both parties\u2019 plans would put more money into the programs, which currently turn away about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/09/despite-new-climate-smart-funds-agricultural-conservation-programs\">two-thirds of worthy applicants</url> for lack of funds.</p><p>The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is already slated to  reverse those numbers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/correcting-the-record-the-ira-made-more-money-available-for-all-conservation-work/\">such that about two-thirds would get funded</url> \u2014 provided the projects offer some benefit to the climate.</p><p>But how to handle those IRA funds is a sticking point between the proposals. Democrats insist that the money allocated by the legislation must remain focused on cutting the climate impact of agriculture \u2014 though they are willing to keep an existing, and controversial, provision that reserves 50 percent of non-IRA funds for livestock operations.</p><p>Republicans, by contrast, want to use IRA funds to cover all conservation programs \u2014 and to expand the category of programs that are counted as conservation. The GOP didn\u2019t specify what new programs would be included under their proposal.</p><p>Such an expansion <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.agriculture.com/red-meat-for-republicans-cuts-for-democrats-in-ag-chair-s-farm-bill-wish-list-8365100\">is popular with Senate Republicans</url>, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/4273201-climate-funds-farm-bill-most-americans-oppose-republican-plans/\">unpopular with the public</url>.

That surge is in turn leading to record <url normalizedValue=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1223\">crop insurance payouts</url> \u2014 which are one big reason why Thompson is looking to SNAP for a new source of funding to stanch the bleeding.</p><p>Both parties\u2019 plans seek to bolster crop insurance programs, in large part to get the U.S. out of a cycle of repeatedly having to pass unplanned, multibillion-dollar disaster supplements. But they differ on how to do this.</p><p>Republicans want to have taxpayers pick up more of the cost of coverage while building out the private insurance markets.</p><p>This proposed course of action has attracted some criticism, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4555036-american-agriculture-consolidation-barons/#:~:text=Hackett%20told%20The%20Hill%20that%20this%20dynamic%20means%20that%20taxpayers%20are%20in%20effect%20being%20forced%20to%20subsidize%20these%20farmers%E2%80%99%20decision%20not%20to%20transition%20to%20more%20diversified%20and%20sustainable%20forms%20of%20agriculture.\">some experts have argued</url> that crop insurance programs disproportionately subsidize the biggest, richest landowners \u2014 and buffer them against any need to meaningfully adapt their operations to meet a changing climate.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/d24106086.pdf\">A November 2023 report</url> by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested that taxpayers\u2019 share should be reduced for the highest-income farmers \u2014 a small minority of highest-income farmers whose operations bring in more than $900,000 per year. </p><p>Those 1,341 high-income farmers received far more from federally backed crop insurance programs than they paid in, according to the report \u2014 about $2.19 in taxpayer support for every dollar they spent on premiums.</p><p>The GAO suggested in the report that while cutting such farmers\u2019 benefits by 15 percent would still leave them getting back more than they put in \u2014 $1.59 for every dollar \u2014 it would significantly increase the stability of crop insurance programs.</p><p>In December, <url normalizedValue=\"https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7720\">Thompson blasted</url> the \u201cone-sided report,\u201d which he said wasn\u2019t \u201cworth the paper it is printed on,\u201c and said the report \u201ccompletely ignore[s] the benefits of Federal crop insurance, which is one of the most successful examples of a public-private partnership in existence.\u201d</p><p>Democrats, for their part, are seeking to make crop insurance more accessible to small farmers and to producers that typically get left out of federal crop insurance programs. </p><p>They also want to direct USDA to create \u201cindex plans\u201d that would provide automatic payouts for climate disasters \u2014 for example, when hail falls over a corn field or a wildfire burns near a vineyard, potentially ruining the taste and marketability of the crop \u2014 without making producers go through a contested claims process.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Offering new support for fruits and vegetables</emphasis></h><p>Support for fruits and vegetables \u2014 euphemistically known in the USDA lexicon as \u201cspecialty crops\u201d \u2014 marks one significant point of consensus between the parties, though the Democrats\u2019 plan would offer more backing than the Republicans\u2019.</p><p>This category of crops, which includes those most likely to fill American grocery carts and refrigerators, is largely left out of USDA crop insurance plans. </p><p>Farmers who grow produce like onions, apples, broccoli or carrots don\u2019t have access to the same disaster-mitigating financial tools as those who grow shelf-stable commodities like corn, wheat, rice, soy or peanuts.</p><p>This bit of arcane financial policy has stark impacts on the American food system, and is one reason why processed foods in the U.S. are so much cheaper than whole foods, despite being less healthy.</p><p>Democrats\u2019 plan directs the USDA to create new crop insurance options for specialty crops \u2014 as well as diversified farms, whose constantly changing medley of crops makes them both more resilient and harder for conventional insurance providers to cover.</p><p>While the Republican policy platform is less explicit, it also directs the USDA to research new insurance policies through \u201crobust engagement with specialty crop producers.\u201d</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fissuring over America\u2019s forests</emphasis></h><p>Both parties\u2019 proposals tout the role of America\u2019s forests in the country\u2019s conservation goals. </p><p>U.S. public and private forestlands cover 78,000 square miles \u2014 the approximate size of Kansas \u2014 and do invaluable work in siphoning down carbon, providing habitats for wildlife and cleaning the water that cities rely on.</p><p>But nearly a century of mismanagement and oversuppression of natural wildfire \u2014 particularly in the American West \u2014 has left the country with a destructive fire problem that has in many areas reached apocalyptic levels, in some cases rendering entire communities uninsurable. </p><p>Democrats and Republicans agree on the need to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health, and on some of the steps for how to do so. Both parties want to increase the size and scope of the Good Neighbor Authority, which lets federal managers contract with counties and tribes to thin publicly owned forests. And both want to build out new markets for novel American-made wood products, like the mass-timber technology that is being used to build skyscrapers.</p><p>But the policy documents reveal a broader philosophical divide on what Americas forests are, and should be. </p><p>Republicans\u2019 vision rests on the idea of the privately run \u201cworking forest\u201d \u2014 a relatively homogenous plantation where trees like pines are grown and tended like any other crop. </p><p>The GOP seeks to increase the health of these lands by reducing forest fire risk through increased logging \u2014 which would be incentivized under the Republican plan both by cutting environmental regulations and contracting private companies to work on public land.</p><p>The Senate Democrats\u2019 plan, by contrast, is focused on the role of the public-sector forests, rather than private ones \u2014 and on the role those landscapes can play in increasing water quality and slowing climate change. </p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com\">For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THHLCM-httpsthehillcompolicyenergyenvironment4639728competingfarmbillplansdemocratsrepublicanstakeaways</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THHLCM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BY2-JNN1-JCMC-W3CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487142</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 NEXSTAR MEDIA INC.

According to news reporting from Damascus, Syria, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The objective of this research is the identification of burned forest areas that occurred in Syria from September 2nd to October 15th, 2020. Forest fire risk classes were determined using Sentinel-2 images.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from General Commission for Scientific Agricultural Research (GCSAR): \"Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Burned Area Index for Sentinel-2 (BAIS2), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for the identification how much the forests have been destroyed and to establish fire risk classes. According to the study results, the size of the vegetation area that was destroyed due to fire was determined, and the probability of the forest fire exposure of these areas was established. The fires also altered some chemical properties in the soil during the combustion process. Thus, this study was focused on the impact of fire on the availability of soil nutrients. Soil samples were collected from three depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) under the forest land a month after the fire in three locations: Al-Fazeen, Sawda and Gard Al-rihan. Pine (Pinus brutia) trees cover these areas.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results of this study indicated that the fire increased pH, EC and sand, the fire also led to an increase in the solubility of the available major soil elements N, P and K. There was an increase in the solubility of the soil microelements Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe while the content of organic material and silt and clay ratio decreased at the three sites in comparison with unburned soil.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Burned area determination using Sentinel-2 satellite images and the impact of fire on the availability of soil nutrients in Syria.

It has also spread further south into the Algarve region, which is a major tourist destination. <br/>Besides the south, major fires were also reported in Leiria in central Portugal and Cinfaes in the north. <br/>The IPMA weather service warned of the highest stage of forest fire risk in more than half of Portugal's territory. <br/>Meanwhile, in the north of Portugal three districts were placed under red alert as temperatures were expected to rise to 41 Celsius (105.8 Fahrenheit) in the city of Castelo Branco. <br/>According to official figures, there have been more than 5,600 fires in Portugal since the beginning of 2023. <br/>In neighboring Spain, there were only a few small fires on Tuesday, all of which were under control. <br/>sdi/wd (Reuters, dpa, AFP) <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/portugal-over-1-000-evacuated-as-wildfire-rages/a-66473198?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_europe-6124-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL10998916915113352832587610008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7827</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WR-WPJ1-JCMN-Y19G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567698</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><timeReceived>4:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

No one in New Mexico has ever suggested hydrologists set water policy. Hydrologists have a role informing the public and policy makers about what we know and the potential consequences of alternative policies for water management. We also have an obligation to be transparent and honest about uncertainties and our absolute inability to predict the future. We do complex simulations to inform decision makers, but these are not predictions. They are best guesses based on limited information and assumptions about the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Other hydrologists will have other best guesses. They are not predictions and not science. So when I hear any hydrologist or any scientist say they know with absolute certainty the sky is falling (future \"massive, uncontrollable wildfires\") and that we should only listen to a select group of New Mexico forest scientists, I am understandably skeptical and recognize their statements as a combination of knowledge, belief and a specific point of view, none of which acknowledges uncertainty. No one can be that certain about the future.</p><p>In forest management, science and management are inextricably linked. This inability to separate science (what we know) from management (what we should do) dominates U.S. Forest Service thinking and policy, confuses the public, muddles our understanding of forest science and starts in our forestry schools.</p><p>Forest management, any management, is an exercise in balancing costs, benefits, potential negative impacts and values. And management decisions depend on who makes the decisions.</p><p>Even with agreement on forest science, taxpayers could justifiably believe the costs of proposed cutting and burning are not worth the benefit (a reduction in fire risk) combined with the added risk and cost of another uncontrolled, prescribed fire. After reviewing U.S. Forest Service forest science, I believe the current risk of a forest fire is acceptable. I also realize that no matter what the Forest Service does, it can never eliminate the risk of forest fire. The only risk the Forest Service can eliminate is the risk associated with another uncontrolled, prescribed fire. That is easy: don't light one.</p><p>I first experienced a controlled burn in the mid-1980s when the Forest Service started a planned 45-acre controlled burn in the Manzano Mountains. Within a little over an hour, the fire had expanded to 1,100 acres, my neighbors evacuated and we were on evacuation alert. Following local outrage, the Forest Service promised to review and improve their plans and protocols for controlled burns and never again burn in the spring when animals are nesting, conditions are dry, and spring winds are not only high but also highly variable and hard to predict.</p><p>And you can replay that response after every uncontrolled, prescribed fire for the past 40 years. The only difference is the Forest Service changed the terms from \"controlled\" burns to \"prescribed\" burns because control implied more control than officials actually had. A series of devastating uncontrolled, prescribed fires up to and including the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire proves that new protocols fail.</p><p>Any other agency with this record would no longer exist. But the Forest Service is rewarded for failure. Who bore the costs of the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire? The taxpayers. Has the service's budget ever decreased because of their failures? Was a new agency created to manage our forests? No. In one of the best examples of institutional disincentive, the Forest Service budget is higher, much higher. Forest Service leaders use their failures to increase fear and funding. So far, it is working.</p><p>Now these same officials want to rush through National Environmental Policy Act requirements before allowing the public to evaluate their latest, best protocols for controlling prescribed burns using only an environmental assessment. It does not provide the risk of a wildfire (not just words but risk); the cost and risk reduction resulting from their proposed actions; a thorough analysis of all alternatives including ignition control and reliance on defensible space around homes and communities; and, yes, the cost associated with accepting the current risk - not in words, in numbers. Realize, the risk from forest fires and the risk of an uncontrolled, prescribed burn will never be zero.</p><p>Paul Davis lives in Durango, Colo., and lost his home to a forest fire in the Manzano Mountains.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15721587</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67FB-CRN1-JBSG-14V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 30, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FOREST SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Public Participation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkwQTAyQTM0QjIzNDAzN0I2RjBBNDczNzA0N0I2NzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjI3QUU4NUZEQzZFNEYzRThENkZBRTA1MkUyQTAwQTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQ4RkY4MDdCOUQ4NEQ3QUFDQkQ0NEFDNDE0MjNDQ0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDAzNzc2QzlDN0ZENDAwNTg5MTkzNUJFMjc1QUEwQjg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XVJ</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Driven by a desire to be useful and help those in need, Clara was a compassionate and tenacious visionary who defied her era's social norms for women and built a legacy of volunteer service that still lives on today.</p><p>Put in her own words: \"You must never think of anything except the need, and how to meet it.\"</p><p>LEADING AMERICAN RED CROSS With Clara at the helm, the American Red Cross was largely devoted to disaster relief for the first 20 years of its existence. The Red Cross flag flew officially for the first time in this country in 1881 when Clara issued a public appeal for funds and clothing to aid victims of a devastating forest fire in Michigan. Over the years, she led several more disaster responses, including severe flooding in Johnstown, Pennsylvania (1889), devastating hurricanes on the Sea Islands, South Carolina, (1893) and in Galveston, Texas (1900).</p><p>As part of the global Red Cross movement, the American Red Cross under Clara also helped to alleviate suffering around the world. In 1892, she organized assistance for Russians suffering from famine and in 1896, Clara directed relief operations on behalf of victims of unrest in Turkey and Armenia, the sole woman and only Red Cross advocate that the Turkish government allowed to intervene.</p><p>Near the end of Clara's tenure, the American Red Cross expanded its services to support U.S. service members and civilians in 1898 when it delivered aid to military members, prisoners of war and Cuban refugees during the Spanish-American War.</p><p>A LIFE OF SERVICE Clarissa Harlowe Barton was born in Oxford, Massachusetts, on Christmas Day in 1821. She excelled in school and blazed a bold path long before she founded the American Red Cross whether it was nursing her injured brother at 11 years old, securing public education for schoolchildren while she was a teacher, caring for wounded soldiers on Civil War battlefields, establishing a national office to help families to locate missing Civil War soldiers, or becoming one of the first women to work for the federal government.</p><p>Clara's service during the Civil War ultimately defined her life and earned her the nickname, \"Angel of the Battlefield.\" Working at the U.S. Patent Office in Washington when the war erupted in 1861, Clara put her job on hold and sprang into voluntary action when she saw a need to provide nursing care and deliver supplies to soldiers on battlefields and in field hospitals.</p><p>\"I may be compelled to face danger, but never fear it, and while our soldiers can stand and fight, I can stand and feed and nurse them,\" Clara wrote to her father during the war.</p><p>Following the Civil War and her subsequent work to locate missing prisoners of war, Clara traveled to Europe in 1869 in search of rest but ended up meeting with representatives from the International Red Cross who inspired her to lead multi-year efforts to found the American Red Cross (1881) and advocate for the U.S. government to sign the Treaty of Geneva (1882).

According to news originating from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Fungi have important ecological functions in the soil of forests, where they decompose organic matter, provide plants with nutrients, increase plant water uptake, and improve plant resistance to adversity, disease, and disturbance. A forest fire presents a serious disturbance of the local ecosystem and can be considered an important component affecting the function of ecosystem biomes; however, the response of soil fungi to fire disturbance is largely unknown.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Forestry and grassland ecological protection and restoration funds project, Foundation of Heilongjiang Academy of Sciences, Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Science and Technology Innovation Center, \"To investigate the effects of fire disturbance on the community composition and diversity of soil fungi in a taiga forest, we collected soil from plots that had undergone a light, moderate, and heavy fire 10 years previously, with the inclusion of a fire-free control. The present soil fungi were characterized using Illumina MiSeq technology, and the sequences were analyzed to identify differences in the community composition and diversity in response to the changed soil physicochemical properties. The results showed that the Chao1 index, which characterizes the alpha diversity of the fungi, did not change significantly. In contrast, the Shannon index increased significantly (&lt; 0.05) and the Simpson index decreased significantly (&lt; 0.05) following a light or heavy fire disturbance compared to the control. The relative abundance of Basidiomycota was significantly higher in the soil of the fire sites than that in the control (&lt; 0.01), and the relative abundance of Ascomycota was significantly lower (&lt; 0.01). The results of principal coordinates analyses (PCoAs) showed that fire disturbance highly significantly affected the beta diversity of soil fungi (&lt; 0.001), while the results of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that the available nitrogen (AN), moisture content (MC), pH, available potassium (AK), and total nitrogen (TN) contents of the soil significantly affected the compositional structure and diversity of the soil fungal communities. The results of functional prediction showed that the majority of the detected soil fungi were symbiotrophs, followed by saprotrophs and saprotroph-symbiotrophs, with ectomycorrhiza being the dominant functional taxon. Fire disturbance significantly reduced the relative abundance of ectomycorrhiza (&lt; 0.05). This study illustrates that fire disturbance alters the structural composition, diversity, dominance, and relative abundance of the guilds of soil fungal communities in taiga forest, and strongly affected the beta diversity of soil fungi, with AN, MC, pH, AK, and TN being the most important factors affecting their community structure.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results may provide a useful reference for the restoration and rehabilitation of taiga forests after fire disturbance.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Cortinarius and Tomentella Fungi Become Dominant Taxa in Taiga Soil after Fire Disturbance.

There's so much denial.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michele Steinberg</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National Fire Protection Association</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joyce Blankenship, an 83-year-old grandmother of four, died inside her home in February when a single brush fire exploded in size in just 24 hours, racing across the landscape, burning her home and others in Stinnett, Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fueled by 50 to 60 mph winds and dry grasses, the fire grew so fast that it surrounded the truck of Cindy Owen, 44, where she was working more than 40 miles east of Blankenship's home. Owen was burned and died of her injuries two days later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Called the Smokehouse Creek Fire, it burned across 850,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle in about 48 hours, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle as firefighters from throughout the region battled to save homes and lives.</p><p>It would be safer for firefighters, communities and property if such infernos were rare, but experts say these massive fires are growing even bigger and more dangerous.</p><p>\"We can expect to see larger wildfires in the future,\" said Seth McGinnis, associate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.</p><p>A window of danger</p><p>Such huge fires, whether ignited by natural or human causes, are fanned by factors including the expansion of suburbia into wildlands, land management and firefighting challenges, and climate change, McGinnis and others said.</p><p>Though the 10-year average number of wildfires in the nation each year dropped by about 20% over the past 20 years, the average number of acres burned is up by nearly 50%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.</p><p>Just as the rain and snow in a passing cold front ultimately helped cool the Smokehouse Fire, the size of a wildfire is related to the duration of fire weather, McGinnis said. \"Climate change is projected to increase the amount of time when high fire conditions prevail in the U.S.\"</p><p>The time is coming for a reckoning and more support of firefighting, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association.</p><p>\"People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire,\" Steinberg said \"There's so much denial.\"</p><p>Fire statistics are complex</p><p>Anytime a large blaze makes headlines, people tend to compare the fire with those of the past, but the world of fire statistics is \"wacky and murky,\" said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and author of several books on fire history. Quantifying fires that happened more than a century ago can be \"a slippery concept,\" Pyne said.</p><p>Using information provided by Pyne and Birgitte Messerschmidt, director of research at the fire protection association, USA TODAY put together a list of the known wildfires or wildfire complexes (groups of fires) with an estimated size of at least 500,000 acres dating back to 1825. The list came from historical documents, state agency lists, the National Interagency Fire Center and the Western Fire Chiefs Association.</p><p>Among all those fire complexes in history, the Smokehouse Creek Fire ranks eighth-largest overall. On a list that includes only fires of at least 500,000 acres since the 1960s, when accuracy started to increase as foresters began measuring burned areas by aircraft, the Smokehouse Creek Fire is the largest single fire. Only the Taylor Complex Fire in Alaska in 2004 was larger, at 1.3 million acres.</p><p>Nearly half the biggest wildfires occurred in Alaska, including seven in just the past 21 years.</p><p>Human activity also to blame</p><p>\"Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,\" the latest National Climate Assessment reported last year. These fires have \"significant public health, socioeconomic, and ecological implications for the nation.\"</p><p>Warmer temperatures create the kind of conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment said.</p><p>A 2016 study led by John Abatzoglou at the University of California, Merced concluded human-caused climate change \"doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984\" in the western U.S. In other research, Abatzoglou documented trends in warming overnight temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Fire scientists are working to tease apart the factors influencing large fires to learn more about the role of climate change, land management and other human influences, McGinnis said. He points out that while climate change is \"almost certainly a factor,\" human activity is responsible for a lot of fire ignitions.</p><p>McGinnis is part of a National Science Foundation University of Washington-based research team studying the effects of climate change and how simultaneous large wildfires might affect firefighting.</p><p>The research team has found:</p><p>Most of the western U.S. is projected to see the numbers of simultaneous fires of at 1,000 acres and greater that historically occurred once every 10 years happening once every five years or even more frequently.</p><p>The median number of large fires occurring simultaneously from July to September was about three times higher in 2010-2019 than it was in 1984-1993.</p><p>In Alaska, the average number of large fires during peak fire activity months almost doubled in 2002-2019 compared with 1984-2001.</p><p>Jon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said it's important to remember climate change isn't solely to blame for the increase in large fires.</p><p>\"It's much more complex than that,\" Keeley said. As the historical lists show, there have been large fires during droughts of the past.\"</p><p>In California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said, and don't appear to be affected by climate change right now. Climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the southern, he said.</p><p>Preparing for wildfires</p><p>Just because a fire is big doesn't mean it's bad, said the fire protection association's Steinberg. Big fires historically have been a natural function, to clean the forest floor, put nutrients back into the soil and promote wildflower blooming, all part of healthy ecosystems adapted to fire over thousands of years. Indigenous peoples also used fire to maintain healthy habitats.</p><p>The problem arises when houses are in the way.</p><p>\"When we talk about the rise of wildfire disasters, by that I mean homes and neighborhoods being obliterated by fire,\" Steinberg said. \"We've got fire on the landscape and then we've got all this built environment, frankly, in the way, and it's largely not designed to withstand anything like the impacts we're seeing.\"</p><p>On top of those concerns, Steinberg said, fire departments are concerned about their ability to safely fight the large, dangerous blazes, especially in a disaster as in Texas when several large wildfires all pop up in the same region at the same time.</p><p>Every five years, the association surveys firefighters about the needs of the 26,000 or so fire departments across the nation. Many of the fire departments are largely staffed by volunteers, and Steinberg said about two-thirds say they lack training or personal protective equipment and gear to fight fires safely and successfully.</p><p>\"That's a terrifying proportion, that we're putting the firefighters lives on the line,\" she said. \"There's a very huge lack of recognition of that problem, and it's only going to continue.\"</p><p>50% increase</p><p>in acreage burned over the past 20years, despite the 10-year average of wildfires decreasing by 20%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.</p><p>850,000 acres</p><p>burned in the Texas Panhandle during a 48-hour time span, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle.</p><p>\"People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire. There's so much denial.\"</p><p>Michele Steinberg</p><p>National Fire Protection Association</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Smokehouse Creek Fire raced across Texas in February, fueled by high winds.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Provided by Sam Craft/Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Marketing and Communications</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-usa2703607592</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BN0-4521-JB1V-G01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 USA Today All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>USA Today</publicationName><edition>2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 26, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Guanghan, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The scheduling of rescue aircraft needs to be studied in depth because of its criticality for the general aviation rescue of forest fires.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Central Leading Local Science And Technology Development Project; Sichuan Provincial Science And Technology Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Civil Aviation Flight University of China: \"This paper constructs a collaborative schedule optimization model for general aviation rescue under the condition of multiple aircraft, from multiple rally points to multiple fire points, targeting the shortest rescue time and the lowest rescue cost in the context of forest fires based on the simulation verification of a forest fire that broke out simultaneously in multiple locations in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm was used to find the optimal set of solutions satisfying the objective function: four feasible solutions. Then, the optimal solution was solved based on the weighted TOPSIS method, which was the optimal solution for this rescue task. The simulation results show that unnecessary flight times can be reduced by optimizing the schedule plan.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Under the premise of ensuring rescue timeliness, the utilization rate of rescue aircraft was improved, and rescue costs were further reduced. The presented work provides a theoretical reference for the efficient development of general aviation rescue.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Optimal Collaborative Scheduling of Multi-Aircraft Types for Forest Fires General Aviation Rescue.

An updated mineral resource estimate completed in January 2023 yielded significantly improved grades and additional ounces at the 100%-owned Fenelon and Martiniere projects, incorporating a combined 3.05 million ounces of indicated gold resources and 2.35 million ounces of inferred gold resources. Fenelon and Martiniere are located within an 830 km2 exploration land package controlled by Wallbridge. The Company believes that these two deposits have good potential for economic development, especially given their proximity to existing hydro-electric power and transportation infrastructure. In addition, Wallbridge believes that the extensive land package is extremely prospective for the discovery of additional gold deposits.</p><p>Wallbridge also holds a 19.9% interest in the common shares of Archer Exploration Corp.

Although the FLI contained in this press release is based upon what management believes, or believed at the time, to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure shareholders and prospective purchasers of securities of the Company that actual results will be consistent with such FLI, as there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any such FLI.\u00a0 Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake, and assumes no obligation, to update or revise any such FLI contained herein to reflect new events or circumstances.

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the FLI, or information contained herein.</p><p>Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in FLI.</p><p>Assumptions upon which FLI is based, without limitation, include: the results of exploration activities, the Company\u2019s financial position and general economic conditions, the ability of exploration activities to accurately predict mineralization; the accuracy of geological modelling; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities; the legitimacy of title and property interests in the Deposits; the accuracy of key assumptions, parameters or methods used to estimate the MREs; the ability of the Company to obtain required approvals; the results of exploration activities; the evolution of the global economic climate; metal prices; environmental expectations; community and non-governmental actions; and any impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Deposits, the Company\u2019s financial position, the Company\u2019s ability to secure required funding, or operations. In addition to the MD&amp;A, risks and uncertainties about Wallbridge's business are discussed in the disclosure materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which are available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Information Concerning Estimates of Mineral Resources</p><p>The disclosure relating to the Deposits and MRE\u2019s in this press release and referred to herein was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 which differs from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\u00a0 The terms \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" used in this press release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"), which definitions have been adopted by NI 43-101.\u00a0 Accordingly, information contained in this press release providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with NI 43-101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other U.S. companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.</p><p>Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves. Pursuant to CIM Definition Standards, \"inferred mineral resources\" are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling.\u00a0 Such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity.\u00a0 An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases.\u00a0 Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable.\u00a0 Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.</p><p>Investors are cautioned that while terms, are substantially similar to CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions and standards under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\"), with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021.\u00a0 The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7.\u00a0 As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources,\" \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\".\u00a0 Information regarding mineral resources contained or referenced in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to U.S. standards.\u00a0 While the SEC Modernization Rules are purported to be \"substantially similar\" to the CIM Definition Standards, readers are cautioned that there are differences between the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definitions Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-8852394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D3-2791-JDPV-B05B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1833\"/><timeReceived>7:50 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

The CIA chief met in Paris with Israeli and Qatari officials, trying to revive negotiations for a cease-fire and a hostage release.</p><p>Gaza\u2019s humanitarian crisis has spiraled as the U.N. and other aid agencies say the entry of food and other supplies to them has plunged dramatically since Israel\u2019s Rafah offensive began more than two weeks ago. On Friday, the top U.N. court \u2014 the International Court of Justice \u2014 ordered Israel to halt the Rafah offensive, though Israel is unlikely to comply.</p><p>At the heart of the problem lie the two main crossings through which around 300 trucks of aid a day had been flowing into Gaza before the offensive began.</p><p>Israeli troops seized the Rafah crossing into Egypt, which has been inoperative since. The nearby Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza has remained open, and Israel says it has been sending hundreds of trucks a day into it. But while commercial trucks have successfully crossed, the U.N. says it cannot reach Kerem Shalom to pick up aid as it enters because fighting in the area makes it too dangerous.</p><p>___</p><p>What we know about the young missionaries and religious leader killed in Haiti</p><p>The local director of a mission group in Haiti and a young missionary couple from the U.S. were attacked and fatally shot by gang members after leaving a youth group activity at a church, a family member told The Associated Press.</p><p>Thursday\u2019s killings of Jude Montis, the local director of Missions in Haiti Inc., and Davy and Natalie Lloyd happened in the community of Lizon in northern Port-au-Prince.

USA!\u201d It was a rare moment of Trump coming face-to-face with open detractors, which is highly unusual for someone accustomed to staging rallies in front of ever-adoring crowds.</p><p>Libertarians, who prioritize small government and individual freedoms, are often skeptical of the former president, and his invitation to address the convention has divided the party. Trump tried to make light of that by referring to the four criminal indictments against him and joking, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a Libertarian before, I sure as hell am a Libertarian now.\u201d</p><p>Trump tried to praise \u201cfierce champions of freedom in this room\u201d and called President Joe Biden a \u201ctyrant\u201d and the \u201cworst president in the history of the United States,\u201d prompting some in the audience to scream back: \u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>As the insults continued, Trump eventually hit back, saying \u201cyou don't want to win\u201d and suggesting that some Libertarians want to \u201ckeep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Richard M. Sherman, who fueled Disney charm in 'Mary Poppins' and 'It's a Small World,' dies at 95</p><p>NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Richard M. Sherman, one half of the prolific, award-winning pair of brothers who helped form millions of childhoods by penning the instantly memorable songs for \"Mary Poppins,\" \"The Jungle Book\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" \u2014 as well as the most-played tune on Earth, \"It's a Small World (After All)\" \u2014 has died. He was 95.</p><p>Sherman, together with his late brother Robert, won two Academy Awards for Walt Disney's 1964 smash \"Mary Poppins\" \u2014 best score and best song, \"Chim Chim Cher-ee.\" They also picked up a Grammy for best movie or TV score. Robert Sherman died in London at age 86 in 2012.</p><p>The Walt Disney Co. announced that Sherman died Saturday in a Los Angeles hospital due to age-related illness. \u201cGenerations of moviegoers and theme park guests have been introduced to the world of Disney through the Sherman brothers\u2019 magnificent and timeless songs. Even today, the duo\u2019s work remains the quintessential lyrical voice of Walt Disney,\u201d the company said in a remembrance posted on its website.</p><p>Their hundreds of credits as joint lyricist and composer also include the films \"Winnie the Pooh,\" \"The Slipper and the Rose,\" \"Snoopy Come Home,\" \"Charlotte's Web\" and \"The Magic of Lassie.\" Their Broadway musicals included 1974's \"Over Here!\" and stagings of \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" in the mid-2000s.</p><p>\"Something good happens when we sit down together and work,\" Richard Sherman told The Associated Press in a 2005 joint interview. \"We've been doing it all our lives. Practically since college we've been working together.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Uvalde families sue Meta and Call of Duty maker on second anniversary of school attack</p><p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Families in Uvalde took more legal action Friday on the second anniversary of the Robb Elementary School attack, suing Meta Platforms, which owns Instagram, and the maker of the video game Call of Duty over claims the companies bear responsibility for products used by the teenage gunman.</p><p>They also filed another lawsuit against Daniel Defense, which manufactured the AR-style rifle used in the May 24, 2022, shooting \u2014 and has already been sued.</p><p>It added to mounting lawsuits over the attack and came as the small Texas city gathered to mourn the anniversary of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

There's so much denial.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michele Steinberg</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">National Fire Protection Association</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joyce Blankenship, an 83-year-old grandmother of four, died inside her home in February when a single brush fire exploded in size in just 24 hours, racing across the landscape, burning her home and others in Stinnett, Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fueled by 50 to 60 mph winds and dry grasses, the fire grew so fast that it surrounded the truck of Cindy Owen, 44, where she was working more than 40 miles east of Blankenship's home. Owen was burned and died of her injuries two days later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Called the Smokehouse Creek Fire, it burned across 850,000 acres in the Texas Panhandle in about 48 hours, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle as firefighters from throughout the region battled to save homes and lives.</p><p>It would be safer for firefighters, communities and property if such infernos were rare, but experts say these massive fires are growing even bigger and more dangerous.</p><p>\"We can expect to see larger wildfires in the future,\" said Seth McGinnis, associate scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.</p><p>A window of danger</p><p>Such huge fires, whether ignited by natural or human causes, are fanned by factors including the expansion of suburbia into wildlands, land management and firefighting challenges, and climate change, McGinnis and others said.</p><p>Though the 10-year average number of wildfires in the nation each year dropped by about 20% over the past 20 years, the average number of acres burned is up by nearly 50%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.</p><p>Just as the rain and snow in a passing cold front ultimately helped cool the Smokehouse Fire, the size of a wildfire is related to the duration of fire weather, McGinnis said. \"Climate change is projected to increase the amount of time when high fire conditions prevail in the U.S.\"</p><p>The time is coming for a reckoning and more support of firefighting, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association.</p><p>\"People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire,\" Steinberg said \"There's so much denial.\"</p><p>Fire statistics are complex</p><p>Anytime a large blaze makes headlines, people tend to compare the fire with those of the past, but the world of fire statistics is \"wacky and murky,\" said Stephen Pyne, an emeritus professor at Arizona State University and author of several books on fire history. Quantifying fires that happened more than a century ago can be \"a slippery concept,\" Pyne said.</p><p>Using information provided by Pyne and Birgitte Messerschmidt, director of research at the fire protection association, USA TODAY put together a list of the known wildfires or wildfire complexes (groups of fires) with an estimated size of at least 500,000 acres dating back to 1825. The list came from historical documents, state agency lists, the National Interagency Fire Center and the Western Fire Chiefs Association.</p><p>Among all those fire complexes in history, the Smokehouse Creek Fire ranks eighth-largest overall. On a list that includes only fires of at least 500,000 acres since the 1960s, when accuracy started to increase as foresters began measuring burned areas by aircraft, the Smokehouse Creek Fire is the largest single fire. Only the Taylor Complex Fire in Alaska in 2004 was larger, at 1.3 million acres.</p><p>Nearly half the biggest wildfires occurred in Alaska, including seven in just the past 21 years.</p><p>Human activity also to blame</p><p>\"Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,\" the latest National Climate Assessment reported last year. These fires have \"significant public health, socioeconomic, and ecological implications for the nation.\"</p><p>Warmer temperatures create the kind of conditions that make fire behaviors more dangerous, the assessment said.</p><p>A 2016 study led by John Abatzoglou at the University of California, Merced concluded human-caused climate change \"doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984\" in the western U.S. In other research, Abatzoglou documented trends in warming overnight temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Fire scientists are working to tease apart the factors influencing large fires to learn more about the role of climate change, land management and other human influences, McGinnis said. He points out that while climate change is \"almost certainly a factor,\" human activity is responsible for a lot of fire ignitions.</p><p>McGinnis is part of a National Science Foundation University of Washington-based research team studying the effects of climate change and how simultaneous large wildfires might affect firefighting.</p><p>The research team has found:</p><p>Most of the western U.S. is projected to see the numbers of simultaneous fires of at 1,000 acres and greater that historically occurred once every 10 years happening once every five years or even more frequently.</p><p>The median number of large fires occurring simultaneously from July to September was about three times higher in 2010-2019 than it was in 1984-1993.</p><p>In Alaska, the average number of large fires during peak fire activity months almost doubled in 2002-2019 compared with 1984-2001.</p><p>Jon Keeley, a senior research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said it's important to remember climate change isn't solely to blame for the increase in large fires.</p><p>\"It's much more complex than that,\" Keeley said. As the historical lists show, there have been large fires during droughts of the past.\"</p><p>In California, population growth, increasing fire ignitions and the Santa Ana winds are bigger factors in wildfires, Keeley said, and don't appear to be affected by climate change right now. Climate change is likely to be a bigger driver in the northern part of the state rather than the southern, he said.</p><p>Preparing for wildfires</p><p>Just because a fire is big doesn't mean it's bad, said the fire protection association's Steinberg. Big fires historically have been a natural function, to clean the forest floor, put nutrients back into the soil and promote wildflower blooming, all part of healthy ecosystems adapted to fire over thousands of years. Indigenous peoples also used fire to maintain healthy habitats.</p><p>The problem arises when houses are in the way.</p><p>\"When we talk about the rise of wildfire disasters, by that I mean homes and neighborhoods being obliterated by fire,\" Steinberg said. \"We've got fire on the landscape and then we've got all this built environment, frankly, in the way, and it's largely not designed to withstand anything like the impacts we're seeing.\"</p><p>On top of those concerns, Steinberg said, fire departments are concerned about their ability to safely fight the large, dangerous blazes, especially in a disaster as in Texas when several large wildfires all pop up in the same region at the same time.</p><p>Every five years, the association surveys firefighters about the needs of the 26,000 or so fire departments across the nation. Many of the fire departments are largely staffed by volunteers, and Steinberg said about two-thirds say they lack training or personal protective equipment and gear to fight fires safely and successfully.</p><p>\"That's a terrifying proportion, that we're putting the firefighters lives on the line,\" she said. \"There's a very huge lack of recognition of that problem, and it's only going to continue.\"</p><p>50% increase</p><p>in acreage burned over the past 20years, despite the 10-year average of wildfires decreasing by 20%, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center.</p><p>850,000 acres</p><p>burned in the Texas Panhandle during a 48-hour time span, torching more than 100 homes and killing thousands of cattle.</p><p>\"People aren't even facing what's reality right this moment in terms of wildfire.

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.</p><p>Canada is in the middle of its worst <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-british-columbia-northwest-territories-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b\">wildfire season</url> on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 153,000 square kilometers (59,000 square miles) from one end of the country to the other, according the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> In Quebec alone, more than 52,000 square kilometers (20,000 square miles) has burned so far this year \u2014 an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \u201cand we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\u201d Boulanger said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-yellowknife-okanagan-british-columbia-0b8661316de35fefe9ceac6fcd9e4431\">Ongoing wildfires</url> have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index \u2014 which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation \u2014 averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year\u2019s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\u201d said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s not just 10% more likely or 20% -- there\u2019s a 600%\u201d greater likelihood.</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn\u2019t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \u201cIt kind of feeds on itself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Canada\u2019s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 yet researchers say they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-indigenous-land-first-nations-impact-3faabbfadfe434d0bd9ecafb8770afce\">disproportionately affected</url> by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated for nine days in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, 50, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>Ratt blames climate change, saying summer heat is more intense and the winters aren't as cold. Ice that used to form in October or November, now often doesn't form until January and then melts faster in the spring. He said the moose also are covered with ticks because many of the birds that used to eat them no longer show up.</p><p>\u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward,\u201d leaving them at risk for future fires, Ratt said.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\u201d for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \u201cthe new reality\u201d and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \u201cWe're really in uncharted territory.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Created in February 2003, the Unit began taking more of an active role in performing fire investigations on state properties and in municipalities where NJDFS serves as the fire official.The following year, the Unit was expanded to include Ignitable Liquid Detection K-9s, an important resource to support fire investigators in their work across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I would like to congratulate the Fire Investigation/K-9 Unit for their dedicated service over the past 20 years, said Lt. Governor Sheila Y. Oliver, who serves as Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. The Units commitment and expertise in fire investigation is unparalleled.</p><p>I am proud of the distinguished work of the Fire Investigation/K-9 Unit, said NJDFS Director and State Fire Marshal Richard Mikutsky. With only a handful of investigators, the Unit is able to handle more than 350 investigations per year. Through the years, hundreds of these cases were deemed Arson with the help of our K-9 partners.</p><p>The Unit is a primary member of many county fire investigation taskforces and has other notable partnerships with the New Jersey Forest Fire Service and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In 2018, the Unit assumed most fire investigative duties for NJ State Police jurisdictions, including marine fires.</p><p>Unit personnel investigate all types of fires and have provided depositions and expert courtroom testimony for dozens of cases across the state, which have led to many successful prosecutions for arson, murders, gang/drug activity, domestic terrorism, and other crimes.Additionally, the K-9 Teams have worked large-scale events such as The Miss America Pageant and Super Bowl 48.</p><p>The Units first three K-9s were Labrador Retrievers that trained with their handlers for more than 400 hours to become certified to NJ Attorney General guidelines.The Unit has since certified 10 K-9s, including Labradors and German Shepherds, with some that were cross-trained for Tobacco Detection as part of a joint venture with NJ Treasury, as well as Cadaver Detection to expedite searching for victims within hazardous fire scenes.The Units K-9s are certified to detect 30 ignitable liquids in both the raw and burned stages.</p><p>Unit personnel provide Continuing Education training to fire officials in Ignitable Liquid Detection K-9s, and The Scientific Method, in addition to assisting the NJ Chapter of International Association of Arson Investigators, NJ Division of Criminal Justice Academy, and NJ Forest Fire Service with specialized fire investigation instruction.</p><p>The Unit has been recognized and received numerous awards including the NJ International Association of Arson Investigators (NJ-IAAI) Unit of the Year award in 2013, the Governors Team of Excellence Award in 2022, and the NJ-IAAI Presidents Award in 2023.</p><p>The New Jersey Division of Fire Safety serves as the central focus for the State's fire service community and the general public in all matters relating to fire safety through the development and enforcement of the State Uniform Fire Code, public education programs and firefighter training programs.</p><p>DCA offers a wide range of programs and services, including energy assistance, housing vouchers, affordable housing production, fire and building safety, community planning and development, local government management and finance, disaster recovery and mitigation, and information privacy.</p><p>For more information about DCA, visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://nj.gov/dca\">https://nj.gov/dca</url>/ or follow the Department on social media:</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Tammori Petty,</p><p>Lisa Ryan</p><p>609-292-6055</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125864821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:683J-PNX1-DYTH-G2H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Is Orcas at risk like Maui? I see lots of heavy fuel on Orcas, dry most summers, unlike years past. Why is heavy fuel important? Dense trees, thick undergrowth and ground cover and yes, wood homes are raw meat for fires. Big fires require fuel and are magnified by high temperature, low humidity, wind and terrain, especially steep slopes. Forest fires are a seasonal hazard, increasing in severity and potentially worse than Maui Island. I'm acutely aware of heavy fuel loads on Orcas because, for eight fire seasons, I fought many wildland fires large and small in several western states.</p><p>Historically big forest fires in Pacific Northwest were rare, but when coastal forest burned, they burned big. One August a coastal fire in Oregon burned 355,000 acres, an area seven times the size of Orcas.</p><p>Structural fires will continue as the primary responsibility of expanding with every new home. But wildland fires are a real threat, requiring trained forest fire crews, upgrading equipment, public education on home defense and much more.</p><p>When a wildfire begins to blow up, or \"crown\" driven by wind and awesome power from heavy dry fuel and incredible heat, firefighters on the ground are no longer in control. They can not rush in and protect a beautiful home in front of such a fire. The fire is in control. Based on my experience, sharing lessons from veteran fire fighters and reading about big fire blowups I've been impressed with time and fire emergencies. Time is a growing issue as heavy fuel fires burn faster, hotter and can rapidly devour trees, homes and lives. When a fire starts to crown and run, time is compressed and danger rushes toward homes, equipment and anyone in its path.</p><p>In the days since Lahaina burned the blame game has begun to identify those responsible. This is a common and unfortunate process following most disasters.</p><p>Hopefully, Orcas Islanders have time to support our fire department with a vote on the next levy. The outcome determines the quality of our fire department and its ability to meet new island challenges. A blame game is always late. And we may not have the time we think we have to protect our island quality.</p><p>Ben Shanks</p><p>Deer Harbor</p><p>Copyright 2023 Islands Sounder</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISLSOU-news20230823PXL4505907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISLSOU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6910-5B61-F0HF-80KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475117</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Black Press Inc.

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.</p><p>Canada is in the middle of its worst <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-british-columbia-northwest-territories-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b\">wildfire season</url> on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 153,000 square kilometers (59,000 square miles) from one end of the country to the other, according the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> In Quebec alone, more than 52,000 square kilometers (20,000 square miles) has burned so far this year \u2014 an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \u201cand we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\u201d Boulanger said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-yellowknife-okanagan-british-columbia-0b8661316de35fefe9ceac6fcd9e4431\">Ongoing wildfires</url> have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index \u2014 which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation \u2014 averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year\u2019s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\u201d said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s not just 10% more likely or 20% -- there\u2019s a 600%\u201d greater likelihood.</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn\u2019t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \u201cIt kind of feeds on itself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Canada\u2019s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 yet researchers say they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-indigenous-land-first-nations-impact-3faabbfadfe434d0bd9ecafb8770afce\">disproportionately affected</url> by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated for nine days in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, 50, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>Ratt blames climate change, saying summer heat is more intense and the winters aren't as cold. Ice that used to form in October or November, now often doesn't form until January and then melts faster in the spring. He said the moose also are covered with ticks because many of the birds that used to eat them no longer show up.</p><p>\u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward,\u201d leaving them at risk for future fires, Ratt said.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\u201d for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \u201cthe new reality\u201d and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \u201cWe're really in uncharted territory.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

Alex Padilla, D-California, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Today, U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) released the following statement after the White House announced that President Biden nominated Kirk Sherriff, the Chief of the Fresno and Bakersfield Offices of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, to fill the vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California that will be created upon Judge Ana de Alba's confirmation to the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>\"We applaud President Biden's nomination of Kirk Sherriff to serve the Eastern District of California. He has established deep roots in the Eastern District and has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to public service throughout his time with the Eastern District U.S. Attorney's Office, where he gained both civil and criminal litigation experience. Sherriff has a strong reputation in the legal community for being fair, sharp, and incredibly hard-working, and we look forward to working with our colleagues to swiftly confirm his nomination.\"</p><p>Kirk Sherriff: Nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California</p><p>Kirk Sherriff currently serves as the Chief of the Fresno and Bakersfield Offices of the Eastern District U.S. Attorney's Office where he oversees federal prosecutions, manages four unit-chiefs, and supervises overall operations, including working with the courts, law enforcement, and community representatives. He is actively involved in investigations and litigation, focusing on fraud, tax evasion, embezzlement, and certain violent crimes. Sherriff spent five years in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District, focusing on forest fire cases, civil fraud, tort cases, and civil enforcement actions before moving to the Criminal Division. In both the divisions, Sherriff has litigated cases before both the Eastern District and the Ninth Circuit.</p><p>Sherriff previously worked as an associate in the Litigation Department of White &amp; Case LLP in New York City and Paris, primarily focusing on arbitration and civil litigation. He also clerked for New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz for one year before returning to private practice at White &amp; Case for four more years. Sherriff received his J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he served as Co-Editor-in-Chief of the Harvard Human Rights Journal and worked at the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, and he received his B.A. from Columbia University.</p><p>###</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-applaud-nomination-of-fresno-u-s-attorneys-office-chief-kirk-sherriff-to-the-eastern-district-of-california/\">https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-feinstein-applaud-nomination-of-fresno-u-s-attorneys-office-chief-kirk-sherriff-to-the-eastern-district-of-california/</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8259884 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8259884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6948-G8X1-DYG2-R02M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"464\"/><timeReceived>11:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 6, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.</p><p>Canada is in the middle of its worst <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-british-columbia-northwest-territories-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b\">wildfire season</url> on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 153,000 square kilometers (59,000 square miles) from one end of the country to the other, according the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> In Quebec alone, more than 52,000 square kilometers (20,000 square miles) has burned so far this year \u2014 an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \u201cand we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\u201d Boulanger said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-yellowknife-okanagan-british-columbia-0b8661316de35fefe9ceac6fcd9e4431\">Ongoing wildfires</url> have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index \u2014 which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation \u2014 averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year\u2019s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\u201d said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s not just 10% more likely or 20% -- there\u2019s a 700%\u201d greater likelihood.</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn\u2019t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \u201cIt kind of feeds on itself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Canada\u2019s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 yet researchers say they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-indigenous-land-first-nations-impact-3faabbfadfe434d0bd9ecafb8770afce\">disproportionately affected</url> by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated for nine days in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, 50, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>Ratt blames climate change, saying summer heat is more intense and the winters aren't as cold. Ice that used to form in October or November, now often doesn't form until January and then melts faster in the spring. He said the moose also are covered with ticks because many of the birds that used to eat them no longer show up.</p><p>\u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward,\u201d leaving them at risk for future fires, Ratt said.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\u201d for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \u201cthe new reality\u201d and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \u201cWe're really in uncharted territory.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer International, and Richard Short, CFO and Secretary. I will now hand the call over to Richard Short.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I will begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the second quarter before turning the call to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations, and our strategic initiatives.</p><p>Also, for those of you that are joining today's call by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website. But before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call. According to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>This quarter, our EBITDA was $30 million compared to Q1 EBITDA of $64 million. The lower results were driven by 37 days of planned major maintenance downtime split between 2 mills compared to no downtime in Q1. We estimate the planned downtime adversely impacted our EBITDA by approximately $60 million. After adjusting for the planned maintenance downtime impact, the improved operating results were primarily driven by higher pulp sales realizations. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $32 million and our solid wood segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $3 million.</p><p>You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and that of the SEC.</p><p>Strong demand for pulp in Q2 combined with softwood supply interruptions in Finland pushed prices higher than Q1 in all our major markets. In China, the Q2 average NBSK net price was $8.11 per ton, up $66 from Q1. European NBSK list prices averaged $1602 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $202 from Q1. And the North American NBSK list price to average $1697 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $257 from Q1. The North American NBHK average Q2 list price was $1437 per ton, up $214 from Q1. The price gap between softwood and hardwood pulp narrowed slightly this quarter in China with the average Q2 net eucalyptus hardwood price at $735 per ton, up $73 from Q1. Total pulp sales volumes in the second quarter decreased by 132,000 tons to 433,000 tons driven by lower production from planned maintenance downtime and the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>All our mills ran well this quarter. In Q2, we had a total of 44 days of downtime at our mills, which included the 37 days for planned annual maintenance and 7 days due to slower than expected start ups. In Q1, we had no planned maintenance downtime. After adjusting for the planned maintenance and impact of the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1, pulp production was flat from the first quarter.</p><p>For our solid wood segment, lumber pricing was mostly flat as modestly higher prices in Europe were offset by lower prices in the U.S. Market. Overall, in Q2, lumber markets remained weak. The random length U.S. Benchmark for western SPF #2&amp;Btr average price was $386 per 1,000 board feet in Q2 compared to $447 in Q1. Today, that average benchmark price for western SPF and Btr is around $3 55 per 1,000 board feet, about 16% decrease from the beginning of Q2.</p><p>For Q3, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the U.S. and European markets as demand is expected to remain weak. In the second quarter, we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment of $34 million or $0.51 per share related to the Torgau facility as a result of ongoing weakness in the European lumber, pallet and biofuel markets. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment.</p><p>Lumber production for Q2 was 111 million board feet, down 12% due to planned maintenance. Lumber sales volumes were 117 million board feet in Q2, down 4%, reflecting the lower production. Our consolidated electricity sales volume totaled 219 gigawatt hours in the quarter, down about 41 gigawatt hours from Q1, reflecting the lower production at our mills. Pricing in Q2 was essentially flat at about $91 per megawatt hour from $94 in Q1.</p><p>In Q2, our pulp and solid wood segments fiber costs were both flat compared to Q1 as supply remains stable. Production for our solid wood segment's mass timber operations was strong in Q2 at 11,000 cubic meters, an increase of about 54% from Q1 due to the timing of mass timber projects.</p><p>We reported a consolidated net loss of $68 million for the second quarter or $1.01 per share compared to a net loss of $17 million or $0.25 per share in Q1. We consumed about $11 million of cash in Q2 compared to about $40 million in Q1. Our net working capital was lower in Q2 by roughly $49 million which provided the cash to repay $45 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.</p><p>As our operating cash flow improves, we will continue to target opportunistic debt reduction. At the end of Q2, our liquidity position totaled $581 million, a modest improvement from Q1 and comprised $263 million of cash and about $317 million of undrawn revolvers.</p><p>Finally, our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on September 25, for which payment will be made on October 3, 2024. That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Rich. Our Q2 operating results were positively impacted by significantly improved pulp pricing, our mass timber business and lower energy costs. These positive effects were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime, which negatively impacted our Q2 EBITDA when compared to Q1 by about $60 million. Overall, all our mills run well this quarter, but the planned downtime and related slow start ups negatively impacted our sales volume relative to Q1's record pulp sales volumes.</p><p>Our lower Q2 sales volumes also reflect the divestment of the Cariboo mill at the end of Q1. I am pleased to note also that within our solid wood segment, our mass timber business was able to execute on some tight deadlines this quarter, which resulted in positive operating results. I will have more to say about this in a moment.</p><p>As Rich noted, this quarter we wrote off the goodwill we recorded with the acquisition of Torgau. Regardless of the technical rules around accounting for goodwill, the fact is that the pallet and lumber businesses in Europe have been weaker for longer than we anticipated. And this is due to a number of factors including the high interest rate environment in Europe that has had a dramatic negative impact on the construction business with a direct impact on lumber prices.</p><p>And in addition, the unprecedented slowdown of the German economy has reduced the commercialization of goods, which is critical for the pallet business. But despite this write down, we continue to expect to realize significant shareholder value from this investment, including the synergies we identified as part of our acquisition strategy.</p><p>We're currently ahead of schedule on our capital investment at Torgau that will expand the mill's dimensional lumber capacity and expect to begin to see the benefit of this investment in mid 2025. In Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in our operations. As previously announced, our stronger operating results outlook has allowed us to adjust our planned 2024 capital spending to be between $100 million and $120 million. You will recall that last quarter, we restarted both our Torgau lumber expansion project and the Spokane shorting line project. Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill.</p><p>We remain optimistic about our cash generation forecast for the remainder of 2024, and we'll be prioritizing debt reduction as we move forward. Overall, pulp markets improved significantly in the quarter with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement. We were seeing improved demand from European paper and tissue producers. This demand was primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports. To a lesser extent, we were also seeing demand increases in North America.</p><p>The permanent closure of NBSK Mills in the last 2 years, the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime at one of the Finland's largest mills created softwood supply challenges, further tightening the supply demand dynamics. Looking forward, we expect modest downward pulp price pressure into the Q3 due to slower seasonal paper demand. However, we expect some positive pricing pressure late in Q3 and through Q4 due to both ongoing global softwood supply challenges and increased seasonal paper demand. We're closely monitoring the Canadian railway union labor issues and have taken steps to mitigate the potential impact it may have.</p><p>In Q2, we produced 422,000 tons of pulp compared to 539,000 tons in Q1. This reduction was due to the impact of the 44 days of major maintenance that we had in Q2 plus the divestment of Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>Our remaining major maintenance downtime in 2024 is scheduled as follows: In Q3, Rosenthal will take a 14-day maintenance shut and Celgar will take a 4-day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total. And we won't have any maintenance plant shutdown in Q4. As a reminder, Celgar will not have a major maintenance shut in 2024 as the mill has moved to an 18-month maintenance schedule.</p><p>Our solid wood segment results benefited from improved mass timber sales in Q2, but was not enough to compensate for the impact of lower lumber prices on average with some small pockets of improvement in Europe, while the U.S. Market weakened. High interest rates globally continue to weigh on housing starts and construction in general. We expect Q3 lumber prices to stay essentially flat. There may be some short term lumber pricing upside due to recently announced lumber production curtailments, the current forest fire situation in Western Canada and the potential for a prolonged Canadian railway strike. Any meaningful long term improvement would be dependent on improved economic conditions.</p><p>That said, we continue to believe that low lumber inventories, the large number of sawmill curtailments, relatively low housing stock, potential wood shortages created by Canadian forest fires and homeowner demographics are still very strong fundamentals for the construction industry, and this will put sustained positive pressure on the supply demand balance of this business in the midterm.</p><p>In Q2, 39% of our lumber sales volume was sold in the U.S. As we continue to optimize our mix of products in target markets to current conditions. Today, our mass timber order file sits at about $55 million. We continue to receive many inbound project inquiries and are finding developers are taking their projects to the point of being ready to execute once the interest rate environment improves.</p><p>Economic stability will meaningfully improve the short term demand for mass timber. In addition, we remain confident that the environmental, economic and aesthetic benefits of mass timber will allow this building product to grow in popularity at a pace similar to that what we've seen in Europe.</p><p>We are well positioned to take advantage of that market growth as we have roughly 35% of North American mass timber production capacity, a broad range of product offerings and a large geographic footprint giving us competitive access to the entire North American market.</p><p>On the other hand, shipping pallets remain weak due to the overhang of the European economy, particularly in Germany. However, due to our efforts to improve our product mix, we saw a slight increase in average pallet prices in Q2. Once the economy begins to show signs of recovery, we expect pallet prices to return to normal levels, allowing this asset to deliver significant shareholder value.</p><p>Heating pellets were down slightly in Q2 due to expected seasonality in this market, but we expect demand and prices to increase in Q3 as customers build their winter stocks.</p><p>As I previously noted, we have restarted strategic and high return capex projects at both our Torgau and Spokane Mills. I have already spoken about Torgau's project, and I wanted to remind you our Spokane project was also originally envisioned as part of our investment strategy for this mill. This project is focused on the mill's wood infeed and sorting processes. Once this project is complete in mid 2025, the mill will be able to source lower cost feedstock and process it into high quality lambstock. Ultimately, this will significantly reduce the mill's fiber costs.</p><p>In Q2, our overall pulp fiber costs were flat from Q1. In Germany, a steady supply of sawmill chips resulted in modest cost decreases and in Canada, a ramp up of Peace River's Wood Room and our Celgar Wood Room strategy -- wood strategy also kept our fiber costs in check. Looking ahead, we expect our fiber cost to remain stable for both our pulp and solid wood businesses in Q3.</p><p>I am pleased with our new lignin extraction plant ramp up and the partnerships we have entered into to support the future commercialization of this product. I expect to share our vision for this product in the near future. As a reminder, this new lignin plant is a large step towards Mercer being able to develop a portfolio of novel offerings before going commercial with it. We're excited about the future prospect of this product as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel based products such as in adhesives and advanced battery elements among many others. This aligns perfectly with our strategy, which involves expanding into green chemicals and products that are compatible with the circular carbon economy while adding shareholder value.</p><p>As the world becomes more sensitive to reducing carbon emissions, we believe that products like lignin, mass timber, green energy, lumber and pulp will play increasingly important roles in displacing carbon intensive products, products like concrete and steel for construction or plastic for packaging.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential demand for sustainable fossil fuel substitutes is very significant and has the potential to be transformative to the wood products industry. We remain committed to our 2030 carbon reduction targets and believe our products form part of the climate change solution. In fact, we believe that in the fullness of time, demand for our low carbon products will dramatically increase as the world looks for solutions to reduce its carbon emissions. We remain bullish on the long term value of pulp and are committed to better balance our company through faster growth in our lumber and mass timber businesses.</p><p>In closing, I am pleased that our pulp markets have improved and that we have the majority of our major maintenance behind us. We're expecting strong operating results from this segment in the second half of 2024. Regarding our solid wood segment, we expect weak economic conditions to continue to keep pressure on demand for construction products and pallets. Finally, we will remain focused on our cost saving initiatives, and we'll continue to prioritize debt reduction as we manage our cash and liquidity prudently.</p><p>Thanks for listening, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions].</p><p>Our first question comes from Hamir Patel with CIBC. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning. Juan Carlos, once the projects at Torgau are completed, which I think are slated for mid 2025, how do you see the percent of your lumber shipments that you sell to the U.S. changing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Hello, Hamir. Yes, what we are expecting with these investments is that once everything is concluded, we'll have about 25% increase in our timber capacity. So we will be able to work with at least 200,000 cubic meters more of wood into our mill. When we look at our total planed lumber capacity, we're thinking that we may be able to add about 240,000 cubic meters of planning capacity. So obviously, a part of that will be destined to the U.S. How much goes to the U.S. will be determined as we normally do based on how we see prices developing in Europe versus the U.S. If you think for a minute, I think it was last quarter or the quarter before that, we were talking about how much was going to the U.S. I think we were up to 55% of our business going to the U.S. a few quarters back. This quarter, we closed at 39% and this is because we saw some important improvements in the U.K. and Ireland market, and therefore, we decided to divert a little bit more of lumber to that space. So we will keep on having that fluctuation. I would say on average, anywhere between 40% to up to 60% as a maximum would be the amount that would flow into the U.S. at any given point in time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thanks, Juan Carlos. That's helpful. I wanted to ask on the pulp side. There's been some reports recently in RISI that Suzano was -- was piloting a kind of new hybrid grade, which I think they're called the U.K. strong to compete with softwood. How do you see the threat to NBSK from some of the innovations that are playing out on the hardwood side?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>As always, those spots will end up finding some space. The way that we see it is as we work through our customers and our teams, not only our sales team but our market development teams, of the technical guys that are working close with customers to make sure that their furnaces are properly set up for the products that they end up producing, that bond we keep on strengthening further and further. So substituting that with an unknown grade, I know it's going to be quite challenging. So we have comfort in making sure that with those customers that we've had longstanding relationship with our softwood pulp, that those will remain, and therefore, we don't see this as a very significant threat. I wouldn't be surprised if a product like this ends up flowing more into a less demanding market, whether it's China or others that where quality is a bit more flexible. But in the case of some of the markets that we play or some of the customers that we play, I think it's going to be a bit more challenging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Fair enough. That's all I had. I'll turn it over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Hole with CIFC Asset Management. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question just a real quick question about the pulp market as you're seeing it right now. Could you give a little color on what you're seeing in Asia? I guess some of the trade publications were saying that prices in Asia were moving down pretty substantially last week. I just wanted to see if you're seeing that and what the sort of play on interplay between what you see there and what happens in Europe?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Absolutely, Brandon. Yes, obviously, there's -- we need to make 2 distinctions. The first one, what's happening on hardwood versus what's happening on softwood. Hardwood, it's undeniable that there's been a correction -- an important correction on hardwood, probably about $100. And this is on the back of Cerrado and from Suzano coming up, that was 2.6 million tons And also the Liangxiang product in China -- project in China, that was 1.7 million tons. So that all that pulp coming to market, obviously, that puts pressure. It makes sense that in a market that is oversupplied, you would start seeing some corrections very quickly, and that is what has happened.</p><p>However, the situation in softwood is different. If anything, softwood is still under a very tightness situation when it comes to supply. So very, very different from where we see hardwood. Even when we look at the demand to capacity ratio, the way it's evolving, we're saying that -- we're seeing that softwood is going to 93% next year and hardwood is going to go down to about 86%. So again, the pressure on hardwood will remain, while softwood will be in a very different situation. That would mean that the spread between the two will expand and obviously, there's going to be some pressure on substitution and whatnot, but I think the fundamentals for softwood being so tight on supply are going to be still very relevant.</p><p>Even if you think about I think it was recently this week, there was another announcement from another mill in Finland that they're already thinking about laying people off and stopping for I think it's three months what I understood it was. And this is a big mill. If they stop for three months, it's almost taking away another 200,000 tons of pulp in the -- from the market in any given year if it's only three months. So again, it just exacerbates the fact that supply on softwood continues to be tight and will be even tighter as we progress and that would have -- what that will translate into is that even if hardwood drops by 100 like it did, the drop in softwood would be mitigated pretty much and very limited.</p><p>So far, the softwood prices, they have come down a bit, I would say probably less than $50 and that's more or less where we think they will most likely remain. Our belief is that as the year progresses and we get past the summer season, which obviously comes with low demand, both in Europe and in China, demands will pick up again and prices and we can recover a little bit of the lost ground in this Q3. Again, not we don't expect that ground to be very significant in Q3. Hope that helps, Brandon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, that's good color. Thank you very much. And then in Germany and obviously you talked about the struggle, the economic struggle there. Are you seeing any signs of improvement there yet or is it sort of bouncing along this low level?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>It's still very timid. Obviously, we see that at least the European authorities' interests are starting to come down, which is a good sign. However, Germany as a country in itself is probably lagging a little bit behind the rest of Europe, which is contrary to what everybody is used to when Germany is the one that's leading the pace. In this case, it's different. It is lagging behind a bit. And that is probably the reason why we believe that the improvement or the recovery, especially in the construction sector, is going to take a bit longer than what you would expect, and that's what keeps us a bit more conservative on what we think we can expect from for either lumber prices or in the case of the German economy itself, what we can expect for the pallet prices in the short term. We're hoping for more of a half -- second half 2025 commencement of some signs of improvement. Because even if interest rates are cut now, that doesn't mean that immediately you will have an impact and lumber prices will go immediately up, we believe that there's a lag between one action and another. So that's a little bit of the timing that we have in our planning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions].</p><p>Our next question comes from Kasia Kopytek with TD Cowen. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's Kasia on the line. You articulated focus on deleveraging over the midterm. Just curious about your thoughts on potential asset divestitures to expedite that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Kasia. The only thing that we've got on the books right now for sale is Santanol. And that process is ongoing, and we don't expect any further write down on that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Got you. Rich, can you talk about your order file and how that varies throughout the cycle? Just getting -- trying to get a sense if there's gonna be any order file timing lags reflected in your Q3 average price realization.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Are you referring to mass timber?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>No, sorry, pulp.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So I guess maybe expand on what you mean by order file a little bit because we sell primarily spot in Asia. And in Europe, our -- we basically sell the mills out every month. Yes, we've got pretty low inventories across the board.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Got you. Okay. So we sell it every month, but you know, if you're selling to a customer, it wouldn't ship for, let's say, 2 weeks or 3 weeks at this point? What does that lag look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. For delivery times, again, it depends on Europe where it's a number of weeks, like, 1 to 2 weeks. Generally, it depends where it's going. But in Asia, yeah, it would take, 30 to 60 days to deliver.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I'm just trying to get a sense, prices are rolling off here, but maybe maybe not all of that's gonna be reflected in Q3. Maybe some of that will bleed into Q4. Just trying to get a sense of the timing. But that's a good color. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Yep. Okay. Great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Go ahead. You were about to say something.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>No. Yeah. I was just going to say if you're trying to use, like, an average, like a 45 day average, it'd probably be for your modeling purposes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yeah. I got it. That's a good rule of thumb. Thanks. So good pickup on the top line for the mass timber business. Is that EBITDA positive at this point?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, it is. It was EBITDA positive, I think, since Q4 of last year. It was the first time that it was EBITDA positive. It was very strong. It was strong this quarter. So we're looking forward to the growth of the business in 2024. We're expecting it to be probably twice the amount of sales that we had in 2023. It should be around $110 million by the end of the year. And Q2 was particularly strong. There were some projects delayed from Q1 that ended up being kind of all compounded into Q2 that made us running against the clock in Q2.</p><p>We delivered all the projects on time and no complaints whatsoever, quality on spec, everything very well produced and delivered, and that allowed us to run our mills more efficiently on one shift only at this point in time. So that's why Q2 was, I would say, more stronger or stronger than what we have planned for as they were picking up a little bit of the slack from Q1. And this is on the back of customers delaying some of their projects, and therefore, we have to adjust with whatever the customer planning schedule is, and that's the situation that followed in Q2.</p><p>In Q3 and in Q4, we don't have any more or very little of the big, big large scale projects that we had at the beginning of the year. So that's a little bit of a change in dynamic. It's going to be smaller projects that we attend to during the second half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for that. That's helpful. Juan Carlos, can you remind me what kind of EBITDA margins are you looking at for that for those sales?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>We talk about EBITDA margins in the long term, more than specifically what we do right now. And we aim for 20% between 10% and 20% in the long run, it's going to be around 20% or more. That's what we expect of mass timber.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And but right now, you're probably sort of just low single digits, I imagine, something in that range?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, got you. That's all I had. Thanks very much everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And the important thing, Kasia, just to expand on that, keep in mind that right now the margins that we're seeing is running with one shift and not being able only in Q2, we've had those shifts practically full in our facilities. Going forward, when we -- as we expand this business, obviously, the margins can grow as we can put 2 shifts or even 3 shifts into those facilities. So that is the key thing here is for us to grow this business in a way that we can add more shifts and take advantage of the capacity that we have installed and therefore have a better return on those fixed costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Juan Carlos Bueno for closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you, Michelle. And thanks to all of you for joining our call. Rich and I are available to talk more at any time, so don't hesitate to call one of us.

On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer International; and Robert [Richard] Short, CFO and Secretary. I will now hand the call over to Richard Short.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RICHARD SHORT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, MERCER INTERNATIONAL INC: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the second quarter before turning the call over to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations and our strategic initiatives. Also for those of you that have joined the call today by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website.</p><p>Before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call. According to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>This quarter, our EBITDA totaled $30 million compared to Q1's EBITDA of $64 million. The lower results were driven by 37 days of planned major maintenance downtime split between two mills compared to no downtime in Q1. We estimate the planned downtime adversely impacted our EBITDA by approximately $60 million.</p><p>After adjusting for the planned maintenance downtime impact, the improved operating results were primarily driven by higher pulp sales realizations. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $32 million, and our solid wood segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $3 million. You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and the SEC's.</p><p>Strong demand for pulp in Q2, combined with softwood supply interruptions in Finland pushed prices higher than Q1 in all our major markets. In China, the Q2 average NBSK net price was $811 per ton, up to $66 from Q1.</p><p>European NBSK list prices averaged $1,602 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $202 from Q1. And the North American NBSK list price averaged $1,697 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $257 from Q1.</p><p>The North American NBHK average Q2 list price was $1,437 per ton, up $214 from Q1. The price gap between softwood and hardwood pulp narrowed slightly this quarter in China, with the average Q2 net eucalyptus hardwood price at $735 per tonne, up $73 from Q1.</p><p>Total pulp sales volumes in the second quarter decreased by 132,000 tonnes to 433,000 tons, driven by lower production from planned maintenance downtime and the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>All our mills ran well this quarter. In Q2, we had a total of 44 days of downtime at our mills, which included 37 days for planned annual maintenance and 7 days due to slower than expected startups. In Q1, we had no planned maintenance downtime.</p><p>After adjusting for the planned maintenance and impact of the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1, pulp production was flat from the first quarter. For our solid wood segment, lumber pricing was mostly flat as modestly higher prices in Europe were offset by lower prices in the US market. Overall in Q2, lumber markets remained weak.</p><p>The random links US benchmark for Western SPF number 2 and [btr] average price was $386 per thousand board feet in Q2 compared to $447 in Q1. Today, that average benchmark price for Western SPF and btr is around $355 per thousand board feet, about 16% decrease from the beginning of Q2.</p><p>For Q3, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the US and European markets as demand is expected to remain weak. In the second quarter, we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment of $34 million, or $0.51 per share related to the Torgau facility as a result of ongoing weakness in the European lumber pallet and biofuel markets. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment.</p><p>Lumber production for Q2 was $111 million board feet, down 12% due to planned maintenance. Lumber sales volumes were $117 million board feet in Q2, down 4%, reflecting the lower production. Our consolidated electricity sales volume totaled 219 gigawatt hours in the quarter, down about 41 gigawatt hours from Q1, reflecting the lower production at our mills.</p><p>Pricing in Q2 was essentially flat at about $91 per megawatt hour from $94 in Q1. In Q2, our pulp and solid wood segment's fiber costs were both flat compared to Q1 a supply remains stable. Production for our solid wood segments mass timber operations was strong in Q2 at 11,000 cubic meters, an increase of about 54% from Q1 due to the timing of mass timber projects.</p><p>We reported a consolidated net loss of $68 million for the second quarter or $1 and $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $17 million or $0.25 per share in Q1, we consumed about $11 million of cash in Q2 compared to about $40 million in Q1.</p><p>Our net working capital was lower by -- in Q2 by roughly $49 million, which provided the cash to repay $45 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities. As our operating cash flow improves, we will continue to target offers opportunistic debt reduction. At the end of Q2, our liquidity position totaled $581 million, a modest improvement from Q1 and comprised $263 million of cash and about 4317 million of undrawn revolvers.</p><p>Finally, our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on September 25, for which payment will be made on October 3, 2024.</p><p>That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.</p><p>JUAN BUENO, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DIRECTOR, MERCER INTERNATIONAL INC: Thanks, Rich. Our Q2 operating results were positively impacted by significantly improved pulp pricing, our mass timber business and lower energy costs. These positive effects were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime, which negatively impacted our Q2 EBITDA when compared to Q1 by about $60 million.</p><p>Overall, all our mills ran well this quarter, but the planned downtime and related slow start-ups negatively impacted our sales volume relative to Q1's record pulp sales volumes. Our lower Q2 sales volumes also reflect the divestment of the Cariboo mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>I am pleased to note also that within our solid wood segment, our mass timber business was able to execute on some tight deadlines this quarter, which resulted in positive operating results. I will have more to say about this in a moment.</p><p>As Rich noted, this quarter, we wrote off the goodwill we recorded with the acquisition of Torgue, regardless of the technical rules around accounting for goodwill, the fact is, the pallet and lumber businesses in Europe have been weaker for longer than we anticipated, and this is due to a number of factors, including the high interest rate environment in Europe that has had a dramatic negative impact on the construction business with a direct impact on lumber prices.</p><p>And in addition, the unprecedented slowdown of the German economy has reduced the commercialization of goods, which is critical for the pallet business. But despite this write-down we continue to expect to realize significant shareholder value from this investment, including the synergies we identified as part of our acquisition strategy. We're currently ahead of schedule on our capital investment at Torgue that will expand the mill's dimensional lumber capacity and expect to begin to see the benefit of this investment in mid-2025.</p><p>In Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in our operations. As previously announced, our stronger operating results outlook has allowed us to adjust our plan 2024 capital spending to be between $120 million. You will recall that last quarter we restarted both our Torgue lumber expansion project and the Spokane sorting line project. Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill.</p><p>We remain optimistic about our cash generation forecast for the remainder of 2024, and we'll be prioritizing debt reduction as we move forward.</p><p>Overall pulp markets improved significantly in the quarter with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement. We were seeing improved demand from European paper and tissue producers. This demand was primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports. To a lesser extent, we were also seeing demand increases in North America.</p><p>The permanent closure of NBSK mills in the last two years, the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime at one of the Finland's largest mills created softwood supply challenges further tightening the supply demand dynamics.</p><p>Looking forward, we expect modest downward pulp price pressure into the third quarter due to slower seasonal paper demand. However, we expect some positive pricing pressure late in Q3 and through Q4 due to both ongoing global softwood supply challenges and increased seasonal paper demand.</p><p>We're closely monitoring the Canadian railway union labor issues and have taken steps to mitigate the potential impact it may have. In Q2, we produced 422,000 tonnes of pulp compared to 539,000 tonnes in Q1. This reduction was due to the impact of the 44 days of major maintenance that we had in Q2, plus the divestment of Cariboo mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>Our remaining major maintenance downtime in 2024 scheduled as follows. In Q3, Rosenthal will take a 14 day maintenance shut and Celgar will take a four day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total. And we won't have any maintenance planned shutdown in Q4.</p><p>As a reminder, Celgar will not have major maintenance shut in 2024 as the mill has moved to an 18-month maintenance schedule. Our solid wood segment results benefited from improved mass timber sales in Q2, but it was not enough to compensate for the impact of lower lumber prices on average with some small pockets of improvement in Europe. While the US market weakened.</p><p>High interest rates globally continue to weigh on housing starts and construction in general. We expect Q3 lumber prices to stay essentially flat. There may be some short term lumber pricing upside due to recently announced lumber production curtailments the current forest fire situation in Western Canada and the potential for a prolonged Canadian railway strike.</p><p>Any meaningful long-term improvement will be dependent on improved economic conditions. That said, we continue to believe that low lumber inventories, the large number of sawmill curtailments, relatively low housing stock, potential wood saw shortages created by Canadian forest fires and homeowner demographics are still very strong fundamentals for the construction industry, and this will put sustained positive pressure on the supply-demand balance of this business in the midterm.</p><p>In Q2, 39% of our lumber sales volume was sold in the US as we continue to optimize our mix of products and target markets to current conditions. Today or mass timber order file sits at about $55 million. We continue to receive many inbound project inquiries on our finding developers are taking their projects to the point of being ready to execute once the interest rate environment improves.</p><p>Economic stability will meaningfully improve the short term demand for mass timber. In addition, we remain confident that the environmental, economic and aesthetic benefits of mass timber will allow this building product to grow in popularity at a pace similar to that, what we've seen in Europe.</p><p>We are well positioned to take advantage of that market growth as we have roughly 35% of North American mass timber production capacity, our broad range of product offerings and a large geographic footprint giving us competitive access to the entire North American market.</p><p>On the other hand, shipping pallets remain weak due to the overhang of the European economy, particularly in Germany. However, due to our efforts to improve our product mix, we saw a slight increase in average pallet prices in Q2. Once the economy begins to show signs of recovery, we expect pallet prices to return to normal levels, allowing this asset to deliver significant shareholder value.</p><p>Heating pellets were down slightly in Q2 due to expected seasonality in this market, but we expect demand and prices to increase in Q3 as customers build their winter stocks. As I previously noted, we have restarted strategic and high return CapEx projects at both our Torgue and Spokane mills. I've already spoken about Torque project, and I wanted to remind you our Spokane project was also originally envisioned as part of our investment strategy for this mill.</p><p>This project is focused on the mill's wood in feed and sorting processes. Once this project is complete in mid-2025, the mill will be able to source lower-cost feedstock and processes into high quality lamp stock. Ultimately, this will significantly reduce the mill's fiber costs.</p><p>In Q2, our overall pulp fiber costs were flat from Q1. In Germany, a steady supply of sandal chips resulted in modest cost decreases. And in Canada, our ramp-up of Peace River's wood room and our Celgar wood room strategy -- wood strategy also kept our fiber costs in check.</p><p>Looking ahead, we expect our fiber costs to remain stable for both our pulp and solid wood businesses in Q3. I am pleased with our new lignin extraction plant ramp-up and the partnerships we have entered into to support the future commercialization of this product. I expect to share our vision for this product in the near future. As a reminder, this new lignin plant is a large step towards Mercer being able to develop a portfolio of novel offerings before going commercial with it.</p><p>We're excited about the future prospect of this product as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based products such as in adhesives and advanced battery elements among many others. This aligns perfectly with our strategy, which involves expanding into green chemicals and products that are compatible with a circular carbon economy or adding shareholder value.</p><p>As the world becomes more sensitive to reducing carbon emissions, we believe that products like lignin, mass timber, green energy, lumber and pulp, will play increasingly important roles in displacing carbon-intensive products. Products like concrete and steel for construction or plastic for packaging.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential demand for sustainable fossil fuel substitutes is very significant and has the potential to be transformative to the wood products industry. We remain committed to our 2030 carbon reduction targets and believe our products form part of the climate change solution.</p><p>In fact, we believe that in the fullness of time, demand for low-carbon products will dramatically increase as the world looks for solutions to reduce its carbon emissions. We remain bullish on the long-term value of pulp and are committed to better balance our company through faster growth in our lumber and mass timber businesses.</p><p>In closing, I am pleased that our pulp markets have improved and that we have the majority of our major maintenance behind us. We're expecting strong operating results from this segment in the second half of 2024.</p><p>Regarding our solid wood segment, we expect weak economic conditions to continue to keep pressure on demand for construction products and pellets.</p><p>Finally, we will remain focused on our cost saving initiatives, and we'll continue to prioritize debt reduction as we manage our cash and liquidity prudently. Thanks for listening, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Hamir Patel, CIBC.</p><p>HAMIR PATEL, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: Hi, good morning. Juan Carlos, once the projects at the Torgue are completed, which I think are slated for mid-2025, how do you see the percent of your lumber shipments that you sell to the US changing?</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Hello, Hamir. Yes, what we are expecting with these investments is that once everything is concluded, we'll have about a 25% increase in our timber capacity. So we will be able to work with at least 200,000 cubic meters more of wood into our mill. When we look at our total plain lumber capacity, we're thinking that we may be able to add about 240,000 cubic meters of finding capacity.</p><p>So obviously, a part of that will be destined to the US. How much goes to the US will be determined as we normally do, based on how we see prices developing in Europe versus the US. If you think for a minute, I think it was last quarter or the quarter before that you were talking about how much was going to the US, I think we were up to 55% of our business going to the US a few quarters back.</p><p>This quarter, we closed at 39%. And this is because we saw some important improvements in the UK and Ireland market. And therefore, we decided to divert a little bit more of lumber to that space. So we will keep on having that fluctuation I would say on average anywhere between 40% to up to 60% as a maximum would be the amount that would flow into the US at any given point in time.</p><p>HAMIR PATEL: Okay. Great. Thanks, Juan Carlos, that's helpful. I want to ask on the pulp side. There's been some reports recently in receive that Suzano is piloting a kind of new hybrid crane, which I think they called the UK strong to compete with softwood. How do you see the threat to NBSK from some of the innovations that are playing out on the hardwood side.</p><p>JUAN BUENO: As always of those faults, we'll end up finding some space. The way that we see it is as we work through our customers and our teams, not only our sales team, but our market development teams of the technical guys that are working close with customers to make sure that their furnaces are properly set up for the products that they end up producing that bond. We keep on strengthening further and further substituting that with a with an unknown grade. I know it's going to be quite challenging.</p><p>So we have we have confidence in making sure that and with those customers that we've had long-standing relationship with our softwood pulp, that those will remain and therefore, we don't see this as a very significant threat. I wouldn't be surprised if a product like this ends up flowing more into a less demanding market, whether it's China or others that are qualities a bit more flexible. But in the case of some of the markets that we play with some of the customers that we play, I think it's going to be a bit more challenging.</p><p>HAMIR PATEL: Okay. Fair enough. But that's all I had. I'll turn it over. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: Brandon Hall, CISC Asset Management.</p><p>BRANDON HALL, ANALYST, CISC ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a real quick question about the pulp market. As you're seeing it right now, could you could you give a little color on what you're seeing in Asia. I guess some of the trade publications were saying the prices in Asia, we're moving down pretty substantially last week. I just wanted to see if you're seeing that and what the sort of play on interplay between what you see there and what happens in Europe?</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Absolutely, Brandon. Yeah obviously, there's we need to make two distinctions. The first one, what's happening on hardwood versus what's happening on softwood. Hardwood, it's undeniable that there has been a correction -- unimportant correction on hardwood of probably about $100, and this is on the back of Cerrado and from Suzano coming up, that was 2.6 million tonnes and also the Liangshan product in China -- project in China, that was 1.7 million tonnes.</p><p>So that -- all that pulp coming to market, obviously that puts pressure, it makes sense that in a market that is oversupplied, you would start seeing some corrections very quickly and that is what has happened.</p><p>However, the situation in softwood is different. If anything, softwood is still under a very tightness situation when it comes to supply. So very, very different from where we see hardwood. Even when we look at the demand to capacity ratio, the way it's evolving, we're saying that -- we're seeing that softwood is going to 93% next year and hardwood is going to go down to about 86%.</p><p>So again, the pressure on hardwood will remain while softwood will be in a very different situation. That would mean that the spread between the two will expand. And obviously there's going to be some pressure on substitution and whatnot. But I think the fundamentals for softwood being so tight on supply are going to be still very relevant.</p><p>Even if you think about I think it was recently this week, there was another announcement from another mill in Finland, that they're already thinking about laying people off and stopping for I think it's three months, what I understood it was and this is a big mill. If they stopped for three months, it's almost taking away another 200,000 tons of pulp in the upfront market in any given year if it's only three months.</p><p>So again, it just exacerbates the fact that supply on softwood continues to be tight and will be even tighter as we progress and that would have -- that will translate into is that even if hardwood drops by 100 like it did the drop in softwood would be mitigated pretty much and very limited.</p><p>So far, the softwood prices, they have come down a bit, I would say, probably less than $50, and that's more or less where we think they will most likely remain. Our belief is that as the year progresses and we get past the summer season of which obviously comes with low demand, both in Europe and in China, demand will pick up again and prices, we can recover a little bit of the lost ground in this Q3. Again not -- we don't expect that ground to be very significant in Q3. Hope that's helps so Brandan.</p><p>BRANDON HALL: Yeah, that's good color. Thank you very much. And then in Germany and obviously, you talked the struggles, the economic struggles there. Are you seeing any signs of improvement there yet? Or is it sort of bouncing along this low level?</p><p>JUAN BUENO: It's still very timid. Obviously, we see that at least the European authorities interests are starting to come down, which is a good sign. However, Germany as a country and itself is probably lagging a little bit behind the rest of Europe, which is country to what everybody's used to, when Germany is the one that's leading the pace. And in this case, it's different. It is lagging behind a bit.</p><p>And that is probably the reason why we believe that the improvement or the recovery, especially in the construction sector, is going to take a bit longer than what you would expect. And that's what keeps us a bit more conservative on what we think we can expect from for either lumber prices or in the case of the German economy itself, what we can expect for the pallet prices in the short term.</p><p>We're hoping for a more of a half second half 2025 have commencement of some signs of improvement. Because even if interest rates are cut now, that doesn't mean that immediately you will have an impact and lumber prices will go immediately up. We believe that there's a lag between one action and another. So that's a little bit of the timing that we have in our planning.</p><p>BRANDON HALL: Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) [Keisha Capitec], TD Cowen.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC, ANALYST, TD COWEN: Hi, good morning, everyone, it's Keisha on the line. You articulated a focus on deleveraging over the mid-term. Just curious about your updated thoughts on potential asset divestitures to expedite that?</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: Hi Keisha. The only thing that we've got on the books right now for sale is Sentinel and that process is ongoing and we don't expect any further write-downs on that.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Okay. Got it. Can you talk about your order file and how that varies throughout the cycle. Just getting trying to get a sense if there's any the order file timing lags reflected in your Q3 average price realization.</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: But are you referring to a mass timber?</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: No, sorry, pulp?</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: Yeah. So I guess maybe expand on what you mean by order file a little bit because we sell primarily spot in Asia. And in Europe, we basically sell the mills out every month. Yeah, we've got pretty low inventories across the board.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Got it. Okay, so it'll sell at every month, but, if you're selling to a customer, it wouldn't ship for, let's say, two weeks or three weeks at this point or what is that lag look like?</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: Okay, for delivery times, again it depends on Europe for it's a number of weeks like one to two weeks. Generally work depends where it's going, but in Asia would take 30 to 60 days to deliver.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Okay. Got it. Yeah, I'm just trying to get a sense, prices are rolling off here, but maybe not all of that's going to be reflected in Q3, maybe some of that will bleed into Q4? Just trying to get a sense of the timing, but that's the color thing.</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: Yeah. Okay, great.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Sorry, go ahead. You about to say something.</p><p>RICHARD SHORT: No. Yeah, I was just going to say, if you're trying to use like an average like a 45 day average would probably be for your modeling purposes.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Okay. Yeah, got it. That's a good wealth on things. So good pickup on the top line in the mass timber business. Is that EBITDA positive at this point?</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Yes, it is. It was EBITDA positive. I think things since Q4 of last year, it was the first time that it was EBITDA positive. It was very strong. It was strong this quarter.</p><p>So we're looking forward to the growth of that business in 2024, we're expecting it to be probably twice the amount of sales that we had in 2023. It should be around $110 million by the end of the year, and Q2 was particularly strong. There was some projects delayed from Q1 that ended up being kind of all compounded into Q2 that made us running against the clock in Q2.</p><p>We delivered all the projects on time and no complaints whatsoever, quality on spec, everything very well produced and delivered. And that allowed us to run our mills more efficiently on one shift only at this point in time. So that's why Q2 was, I would say, a lot more stronger or stronger than what we had planned for as they were picking up a little bit of the slack from [20] from Q1.</p><p>And this is on the back of customers delaying some of their projects. And therefore, we have to adjust with whatever the customer planning schedule is. And that's the situation that followed in Q2. In Q3 and in Q4, we don't have any more or very little of the big, big large-scale projects that we had at the beginning of the year. So that's a little bit of a change in dynamic. It's going to be smaller projects that we attend to during the second half of the year.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Thanks for that. That's helpful. Juan Carlos, can you remind me what kind of EBITDA margins are you looking at for that -- for those sales?</p><p>JUAN BUENO: We talk about EBITDA margins in the long term, more than specifically what we do right now. And we aim for fourth, 20% between 10% and 20% in the long run, it's going to be around 20% or more.</p><p>That's what we expect of mass timber.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Okay. And but right now, probably just low single digits I imagine, something in that range.</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Yeah.</p><p>KEISHA CAPITEC: Okay. Got you. That's all I had. Thanks very much, Juen.</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Thank you. And the important thing Keisha just to expand on that, keep in mind that right now are the margins that we're seeing is running with one shift and not being able only in Q2, we've had those shifts practically for in our facilities.</p><p>Going forward, when we as we expand this business, obviously the margins can grow as we can put two shifts or even three shifts into those facilities. So that is the key thing here is for us to grow this business in a way that we can add more shifts and take advantage of the capacity that we have installed and therefore I'll have better return on those fixed costs.</p><p>OPERATOR: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Juan Carlos Bueno for closing remarks.</p><p>JUAN BUENO: Okay. Thank you, Michelle, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. Rich and I are available to talk more at any time, so don't hesitate to call one of us. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call in November. Bye for now.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

On the call today is Juan Carlos Bueno, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mercer International, and Richard Short, CFO and Secretary. I will now hand the call over to Richard Short.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I will begin by touching on the financial and operating highlights of the second quarter before turning the call to Juan Carlos to provide further color into the markets, our operations, and our strategic initiatives.</p><p>Also, for those of you that are joining today's call by telephone, there is presentation material that we have attached to the Investors section of our website. But before turning to our results, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements in this morning's conference call. According to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, I'd like to call your attention to the risks related to these statements, which are more fully described in our press release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>This quarter, our EBITDA was $30 million compared to Q1 EBITDA of $64 million. The lower results were driven by 37 days of planned major maintenance downtime split between 2 mills compared to no downtime in Q1. We estimate the planned downtime adversely impacted our EBITDA by approximately $60 million. After adjusting for the planned maintenance downtime impact, the improved operating results were primarily driven by higher pulp sales realizations. Our pulp segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $32 million and our solid wood segment contributed quarterly EBITDA of $3 million.</p><p>You can find additional segment disclosures in our Form 10-Q, which can be found on our website and that of the SEC.</p><p>Strong demand for pulp in Q2 combined with softwood supply interruptions in Finland pushed prices higher than Q1 in all our major markets. In China, the Q2 average NBSK net price was $8.11 per ton, up $66 from Q1. European NBSK list prices averaged $1602 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $202 from Q1. And the North American NBSK list price to average $1697 per ton in the current quarter, an increase of $257 from Q1. The North American NBHK average Q2 list price was $1437 per ton, up $214 from Q1. The price gap between softwood and hardwood pulp narrowed slightly this quarter in China with the average Q2 net eucalyptus hardwood price at $735 per ton, up $73 from Q1. Total pulp sales volumes in the second quarter decreased by 132,000 tons to 433,000 tons driven by lower production from planned maintenance downtime and the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>All our mills ran well this quarter. In Q2, we had a total of 44 days of downtime at our mills, which included the 37 days for planned annual maintenance and 7 days due to slower than expected start ups. In Q1, we had no planned maintenance downtime. After adjusting for the planned maintenance and impact of the disposition of our equity interest in the Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1, pulp production was flat from the first quarter.</p><p>For our solid wood segment, lumber pricing was mostly flat as modestly higher prices in Europe were offset by lower prices in the U.S. Market. Overall, in Q2, lumber markets remained weak. The random length U.S. Benchmark for western SPF #2&amp;Btr average price was $386 per 1,000 board feet in Q2 compared to $447 in Q1. Today, that average benchmark price for western SPF and Btr is around $3 55 per 1,000 board feet, about 16% decrease from the beginning of Q2.</p><p>For Q3, we are expecting generally flat lumber prices in the U.S. and European markets as demand is expected to remain weak. In the second quarter, we recognized a noncash goodwill impairment of $34 million or $0.51 per share related to the Torgau facility as a result of ongoing weakness in the European lumber, pallet and biofuel markets. Juan Carlos will have more to say on this in a moment.</p><p>Lumber production for Q2 was 111 million board feet, down 12% due to planned maintenance. Lumber sales volumes were 117 million board feet in Q2, down 4%, reflecting the lower production. Our consolidated electricity sales volume totaled 219 gigawatt hours in the quarter, down about 41 gigawatt hours from Q1, reflecting the lower production at our mills. Pricing in Q2 was essentially flat at about $91 per megawatt hour from $94 in Q1.</p><p>In Q2, our pulp and solid wood segments fiber costs were both flat compared to Q1 as supply remains stable. Production for our solid wood segment's mass timber operations was strong in Q2 at 11,000 cubic meters, an increase of about 54% from Q1 due to the timing of mass timber projects.</p><p>We reported a consolidated net loss of $68 million for the second quarter or $1.01 per share compared to a net loss of $17 million or $0.25 per share in Q1. We consumed about $11 million of cash in Q2 compared to about $40 million in Q1. Our net working capital was lower in Q2 by roughly $49 million which provided the cash to repay $45 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities.</p><p>As our operating cash flow improves, we will continue to target opportunistic debt reduction. At the end of Q2, our liquidity position totaled $581 million, a modest improvement from Q1 and comprised $263 million of cash and about $317 million of undrawn revolvers.</p><p>Finally, our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for shareholders of record on September 25, for which payment will be made on October 3, 2024. That ends my overview of the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Juan Carlos.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Rich. Our Q2 operating results were positively impacted by significantly improved pulp pricing, our mass timber business and lower energy costs. These positive effects were more than offset by planned maintenance downtime, which negatively impacted our Q2 EBITDA when compared to Q1 by about $60 million. Overall, all our mills run well this quarter, but the planned downtime and related slow start ups negatively impacted our sales volume relative to Q1's record pulp sales volumes.</p><p>Our lower Q2 sales volumes also reflect the divestment of the Cariboo mill at the end of Q1. I am pleased to note also that within our solid wood segment, our mass timber business was able to execute on some tight deadlines this quarter, which resulted in positive operating results. I will have more to say about this in a moment.</p><p>As Rich noted, this quarter we wrote off the goodwill we recorded with the acquisition of Torgau. Regardless of the technical rules around accounting for goodwill, the fact is that the pallet and lumber businesses in Europe have been weaker for longer than we anticipated. And this is due to a number of factors including the high interest rate environment in Europe that has had a dramatic negative impact on the construction business with a direct impact on lumber prices.</p><p>And in addition, the unprecedented slowdown of the German economy has reduced the commercialization of goods, which is critical for the pallet business. But despite this write down, we continue to expect to realize significant shareholder value from this investment, including the synergies we identified as part of our acquisition strategy.</p><p>We're currently ahead of schedule on our capital investment at Torgau that will expand the mill's dimensional lumber capacity and expect to begin to see the benefit of this investment in mid 2025. In Q2, we invested roughly $20 million in our operations. As previously announced, our stronger operating results outlook has allowed us to adjust our planned 2024 capital spending to be between $100 million and $120 million. You will recall that last quarter, we restarted both our Torgau lumber expansion project and the Spokane shorting line project. Both of them will provide significant added value and were originally contemplated as part of our investment strategy for each mill.</p><p>We remain optimistic about our cash generation forecast for the remainder of 2024, and we'll be prioritizing debt reduction as we move forward. Overall, pulp markets improved significantly in the quarter with both the European and North American markets showing the most improvement. We were seeing improved demand from European paper and tissue producers. This demand was primarily the result of merchant destocking and logistical challenges around Chinese imports. To a lesser extent, we were also seeing demand increases in North America.</p><p>The permanent closure of NBSK Mills in the last 2 years, the impact of the finished transport strike and the significant unplanned downtime at one of the Finland's largest mills created softwood supply challenges, further tightening the supply demand dynamics. Looking forward, we expect modest downward pulp price pressure into the Q3 due to slower seasonal paper demand. However, we expect some positive pricing pressure late in Q3 and through Q4 due to both ongoing global softwood supply challenges and increased seasonal paper demand. We're closely monitoring the Canadian railway union labor issues and have taken steps to mitigate the potential impact it may have.</p><p>In Q2, we produced 422,000 tons of pulp compared to 539,000 tons in Q1. This reduction was due to the impact of the 44 days of major maintenance that we had in Q2 plus the divestment of Cariboo Mill at the end of Q1.</p><p>Our remaining major maintenance downtime in 2024 is scheduled as follows: In Q3, Rosenthal will take a 14-day maintenance shut and Celgar will take a 4-day mini shut, which will amount to about 20,000 tons production loss in total. And we won't have any maintenance plant shutdown in Q4. As a reminder, Celgar will not have a major maintenance shut in 2024 as the mill has moved to an 18-month maintenance schedule.</p><p>Our solid wood segment results benefited from improved mass timber sales in Q2, but was not enough to compensate for the impact of lower lumber prices on average with some small pockets of improvement in Europe, while the U.S. Market weakened. High interest rates globally continue to weigh on housing starts and construction in general. We expect Q3 lumber prices to stay essentially flat. There may be some short term lumber pricing upside due to recently announced lumber production curtailments, the current forest fire situation in Western Canada and the potential for a prolonged Canadian railway strike. Any meaningful long term improvement would be dependent on improved economic conditions.</p><p>That said, we continue to believe that low lumber inventories, the large number of sawmill curtailments, relatively low housing stock, potential wood shortages created by Canadian forest fires and homeowner demographics are still very strong fundamentals for the construction industry, and this will put sustained positive pressure on the supply demand balance of this business in the midterm.</p><p>In Q2, 39% of our lumber sales volume was sold in the U.S. As we continue to optimize our mix of products in target markets to current conditions. Today, our mass timber order file sits at about $55 million. We continue to receive many inbound project inquiries and are finding developers are taking their projects to the point of being ready to execute once the interest rate environment improves.</p><p>Economic stability will meaningfully improve the short term demand for mass timber. In addition, we remain confident that the environmental, economic and aesthetic benefits of mass timber will allow this building product to grow in popularity at a pace similar to that what we've seen in Europe.</p><p>We are well positioned to take advantage of that market growth as we have roughly 35% of North American mass timber production capacity, a broad range of product offerings and a large geographic footprint giving us competitive access to the entire North American market.</p><p>On the other hand, shipping pallets remain weak due to the overhang of the European economy, particularly in Germany. However, due to our efforts to improve our product mix, we saw a slight increase in average pallet prices in Q2. Once the economy begins to show signs of recovery, we expect pallet prices to return to normal levels, allowing this asset to deliver significant shareholder value.</p><p>Heating pellets were down slightly in Q2 due to expected seasonality in this market, but we expect demand and prices to increase in Q3 as customers build their winter stocks.</p><p>As I previously noted, we have restarted strategic and high return capex projects at both our Torgau and Spokane Mills. I have already spoken about Torgau's project, and I wanted to remind you our Spokane project was also originally envisioned as part of our investment strategy for this mill. This project is focused on the mill's wood infeed and sorting processes. Once this project is complete in mid 2025, the mill will be able to source lower cost feedstock and process it into high quality lambstock. Ultimately, this will significantly reduce the mill's fiber costs.</p><p>In Q2, our overall pulp fiber costs were flat from Q1. In Germany, a steady supply of sawmill chips resulted in modest cost decreases and in Canada, a ramp up of Peace River's Wood Room and our Celgar Wood Room strategy -- wood strategy also kept our fiber costs in check. Looking ahead, we expect our fiber cost to remain stable for both our pulp and solid wood businesses in Q3.</p><p>I am pleased with our new lignin extraction plant ramp up and the partnerships we have entered into to support the future commercialization of this product. I expect to share our vision for this product in the near future. As a reminder, this new lignin plant is a large step towards Mercer being able to develop a portfolio of novel offerings before going commercial with it. We're excited about the future prospect of this product as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel based products such as in adhesives and advanced battery elements among many others. This aligns perfectly with our strategy, which involves expanding into green chemicals and products that are compatible with the circular carbon economy while adding shareholder value.</p><p>As the world becomes more sensitive to reducing carbon emissions, we believe that products like lignin, mass timber, green energy, lumber and pulp will play increasingly important roles in displacing carbon intensive products, products like concrete and steel for construction or plastic for packaging.</p><p>Furthermore, the potential demand for sustainable fossil fuel substitutes is very significant and has the potential to be transformative to the wood products industry. We remain committed to our 2030 carbon reduction targets and believe our products form part of the climate change solution. In fact, we believe that in the fullness of time, demand for our low carbon products will dramatically increase as the world looks for solutions to reduce its carbon emissions. We remain bullish on the long term value of pulp and are committed to better balance our company through faster growth in our lumber and mass timber businesses.</p><p>In closing, I am pleased that our pulp markets have improved and that we have the majority of our major maintenance behind us. We're expecting strong operating results from this segment in the second half of 2024. Regarding our solid wood segment, we expect weak economic conditions to continue to keep pressure on demand for construction products and pallets. Finally, we will remain focused on our cost saving initiatives, and we'll continue to prioritize debt reduction as we manage our cash and liquidity prudently.</p><p>Thanks for listening, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions].</p><p>Our first question comes from Hamir Patel with CIBC. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning. Juan Carlos, once the projects at Torgau are completed, which I think are slated for mid 2025, how do you see the percent of your lumber shipments that you sell to the U.S. changing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Hello, Hamir. Yes, what we are expecting with these investments is that once everything is concluded, we'll have about 25% increase in our timber capacity. So we will be able to work with at least 200,000 cubic meters more of wood into our mill. When we look at our total planed lumber capacity, we're thinking that we may be able to add about 240,000 cubic meters of planning capacity. So obviously, a part of that will be destined to the U.S. How much goes to the U.S. will be determined as we normally do based on how we see prices developing in Europe versus the U.S. If you think for a minute, I think it was last quarter or the quarter before that, we were talking about how much was going to the U.S. I think we were up to 55% of our business going to the U.S. a few quarters back. This quarter, we closed at 39% and this is because we saw some important improvements in the U.K. and Ireland market, and therefore, we decided to divert a little bit more of lumber to that space. So we will keep on having that fluctuation. I would say on average, anywhere between 40% to up to 60% as a maximum would be the amount that would flow into the U.S. at any given point in time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, great. Thanks, Juan Carlos. That's helpful. I wanted to ask on the pulp side. There's been some reports recently in RISI that Suzano was -- was piloting a kind of new hybrid grade, which I think they're called the U.K. strong to compete with softwood. How do you see the threat to NBSK from some of the innovations that are playing out on the hardwood side?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>As always, those spots will end up finding some space. The way that we see it is as we work through our customers and our teams, not only our sales team but our market development teams, of the technical guys that are working close with customers to make sure that their furnaces are properly set up for the products that they end up producing, that bond we keep on strengthening further and further. So substituting that with an unknown grade, I know it's going to be quite challenging. So we have comfort in making sure that with those customers that we've had longstanding relationship with our softwood pulp, that those will remain, and therefore, we don't see this as a very significant threat. I wouldn't be surprised if a product like this ends up flowing more into a less demanding market, whether it's China or others that where quality is a bit more flexible. But in the case of some of the markets that we play or some of the customers that we play, I think it's going to be a bit more challenging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hamir Patel:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Fair enough. That's all I had. I'll turn it over. Thank you.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Hole with CIFC Asset Management. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question just a real quick question about the pulp market as you're seeing it right now. Could you give a little color on what you're seeing in Asia? I guess some of the trade publications were saying that prices in Asia were moving down pretty substantially last week. I just wanted to see if you're seeing that and what the sort of play on interplay between what you see there and what happens in Europe?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Absolutely, Brandon. Yes, obviously, there's -- we need to make 2 distinctions. The first one, what's happening on hardwood versus what's happening on softwood. Hardwood, it's undeniable that there's been a correction -- an important correction on hardwood, probably about $100. And this is on the back of Cerrado and from Suzano coming up, that was 2.6 million tons And also the Liangxiang product in China -- project in China, that was 1.7 million tons. So that all that pulp coming to market, obviously, that puts pressure. It makes sense that in a market that is oversupplied, you would start seeing some corrections very quickly, and that is what has happened.</p><p>However, the situation in softwood is different. If anything, softwood is still under a very tightness situation when it comes to supply. So very, very different from where we see hardwood. Even when we look at the demand to capacity ratio, the way it's evolving, we're saying that -- we're seeing that softwood is going to 93% next year and hardwood is going to go down to about 86%. So again, the pressure on hardwood will remain, while softwood will be in a very different situation. That would mean that the spread between the two will expand and obviously, there's going to be some pressure on substitution and whatnot, but I think the fundamentals for softwood being so tight on supply are going to be still very relevant.</p><p>Even if you think about I think it was recently this week, there was another announcement from another mill in Finland that they're already thinking about laying people off and stopping for I think it's three months what I understood it was. And this is a big mill. If they stop for three months, it's almost taking away another 200,000 tons of pulp in the -- from the market in any given year if it's only three months. So again, it just exacerbates the fact that supply on softwood continues to be tight and will be even tighter as we progress and that would have -- what that will translate into is that even if hardwood drops by 100 like it did, the drop in softwood would be mitigated pretty much and very limited.</p><p>So far, the softwood prices, they have come down a bit, I would say probably less than $50 and that's more or less where we think they will most likely remain. Our belief is that as the year progresses and we get past the summer season, which obviously comes with low demand, both in Europe and in China, demands will pick up again and prices and we can recover a little bit of the lost ground in this Q3. Again, not we don't expect that ground to be very significant in Q3. Hope that helps, Brandon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, that's good color. Thank you very much. And then in Germany and obviously you talked about the struggle, the economic struggle there. Are you seeing any signs of improvement there yet or is it sort of bouncing along this low level?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>It's still very timid. Obviously, we see that at least the European authorities' interests are starting to come down, which is a good sign. However, Germany as a country in itself is probably lagging a little bit behind the rest of Europe, which is contrary to what everybody is used to when Germany is the one that's leading the pace. In this case, it's different. It is lagging behind a bit. And that is probably the reason why we believe that the improvement or the recovery, especially in the construction sector, is going to take a bit longer than what you would expect, and that's what keeps us a bit more conservative on what we think we can expect from for either lumber prices or in the case of the German economy itself, what we can expect for the pallet prices in the short term. We're hoping for more of a half -- second half 2025 commencement of some signs of improvement. Because even if interest rates are cut now, that doesn't mean that immediately you will have an impact and lumber prices will go immediately up, we believe that there's a lag between one action and another. So that's a little bit of the timing that we have in our planning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brandon Hole:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>[Operator Instructions].</p><p>Our next question comes from Kasia Kopytek with TD Cowen. Your line is open.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's Kasia on the line. You articulated focus on deleveraging over the midterm. Just curious about your thoughts on potential asset divestitures to expedite that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Hi, Kasia. The only thing that we've got on the books right now for sale is Santanol. And that process is ongoing, and we don't expect any further write down on that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Got you. Rich, can you talk about your order file and how that varies throughout the cycle? Just getting -- trying to get a sense if there's gonna be any order file timing lags reflected in your Q3 average price realization.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Are you referring to mass timber?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>No, sorry, pulp.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Yes. So I guess maybe expand on what you mean by order file a little bit because we sell primarily spot in Asia. And in Europe, our -- we basically sell the mills out every month. Yes, we've got pretty low inventories across the board.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Got you. Okay. So we sell it every month, but you know, if you're selling to a customer, it wouldn't ship for, let's say, 2 weeks or 3 weeks at this point? What does that lag look like?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. For delivery times, again, it depends on Europe where it's a number of weeks, like, 1 to 2 weeks. Generally, it depends where it's going. But in Asia, yeah, it would take, 30 to 60 days to deliver.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I'm just trying to get a sense, prices are rolling off here, but maybe maybe not all of that's gonna be reflected in Q3. Maybe some of that will bleed into Q4. Just trying to get a sense of the timing. But that's a good color. Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>Yep. Okay. Great.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Sorry. Go ahead. You were about to say something.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Short:</emphasis></p><p>No. Yeah. I was just going to say if you're trying to use, like, an average, like a 45 day average, it'd probably be for your modeling purposes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Yeah. I got it. That's a good rule of thumb. Thanks. So good pickup on the top line for the mass timber business. Is that EBITDA positive at this point?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Yes, it is. It was EBITDA positive, I think, since Q4 of last year. It was the first time that it was EBITDA positive. It was very strong. It was strong this quarter. So we're looking forward to the growth of the business in 2024. We're expecting it to be probably twice the amount of sales that we had in 2023. It should be around $110 million by the end of the year. And Q2 was particularly strong. There were some projects delayed from Q1 that ended up being kind of all compounded into Q2 that made us running against the clock in Q2.</p><p>We delivered all the projects on time and no complaints whatsoever, quality on spec, everything very well produced and delivered, and that allowed us to run our mills more efficiently on one shift only at this point in time. So that's why Q2 was, I would say, more stronger or stronger than what we have planned for as they were picking up a little bit of the slack from Q1. And this is on the back of customers delaying some of their projects, and therefore, we have to adjust with whatever the customer planning schedule is, and that's the situation that followed in Q2.</p><p>In Q3 and in Q4, we don't have any more or very little of the big, big large scale projects that we had at the beginning of the year. So that's a little bit of a change in dynamic. It's going to be smaller projects that we attend to during the second half of the year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks for that. That's helpful. Juan Carlos, can you remind me what kind of EBITDA margins are you looking at for that for those sales?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>We talk about EBITDA margins in the long term, more than specifically what we do right now. And we aim for 20% between 10% and 20% in the long run, it's going to be around 20% or more. That's what we expect of mass timber.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. And but right now, you're probably sort of just low single digits, I imagine, something in that range?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Yes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kasia Kopytek:</emphasis></p><p>Okay, got you. That's all I had. Thanks very much everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. And the important thing, Kasia, just to expand on that, keep in mind that right now the margins that we're seeing is running with one shift and not being able only in Q2, we've had those shifts practically full in our facilities. Going forward, when we -- as we expand this business, obviously, the margins can grow as we can put 2 shifts or even 3 shifts into those facilities. So that is the key thing here is for us to grow this business in a way that we can add more shifts and take advantage of the capacity that we have installed and therefore have a better return on those fixed costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operator:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Juan Carlos Bueno for closing remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Juan Carlos Bueno:</emphasis></p><p>Okay. Thank you, Michelle. And thanks to all of you for joining our call. Rich and I are available to talk more at any time, so don't hesitate to call one of us. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking to you again on our next earnings call in November.

He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events.</p><p>Canada is in the middle of its worst <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-british-columbia-northwest-territories-2450568b1db8152ad8f39b8197df321b\">wildfire season</url> on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 153,000 square kilometers (59,000 square miles) from one end of the country to the other, according the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ciffc.ca/\">Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</url> In Quebec alone, more than 52,000 square kilometers (20,000 square miles) has burned so far this year \u2014 an area 176 times larger than all of last year.</p><p>Though the analysis looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, \u201cand we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,\u201d Boulanger said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-yellowknife-okanagan-british-columbia-0b8661316de35fefe9ceac6fcd9e4431\">Ongoing wildfires</url> have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories.</p><p>The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index \u2014 which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation \u2014 averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely.</p><p>They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely.</p><p>Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year\u2019s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change.</p><p>\u201cTo me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,\u201d said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s not just 10% more likely or 20% -- there\u2019s a 700%\u201d greater likelihood.</p><p>Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn\u2019t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia.</p><p>\u201cI've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time ... and fire season is not over yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. \u201cIt kind of feeds on itself,\u201d he added.</p><p>Canada\u2019s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country.</p><p>In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous \u2014 First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit \u2014 yet researchers say they were <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfire-indigenous-land-first-nations-impact-3faabbfadfe434d0bd9ecafb8770afce\">disproportionately affected</url> by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest.</p><p>The Algonquins of Barriere Lake in northern Quebec evacuated for nine days in June because of heavy smoke from wildfires that came within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of the reserve where about 350 to 400 people live, often miles apart, said Chief Casey Ratt, 50, who never experienced a forest fire before this year.</p><p>Ratt blames climate change, saying summer heat is more intense and the winters aren't as cold. Ice that used to form in October or November, now often doesn't form until January and then melts faster in the spring. He said the moose also are covered with ticks because many of the birds that used to eat them no longer show up.</p><p>\u201cI think this will be the norm moving forward,\u201d leaving them at risk for future fires, Ratt said.</p><p>Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. \"That's a very big wake-up call\u201d for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said.</p><p>Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are \u201cthe new reality\u201d and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,\" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p>He added: \u201cWe're really in uncharted territory.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

It's great to have you here in Montreal this morning for our investor presentation. We've got a really exciting presentation lined up and many of our leadership sitting around the room for discussion in breaks and to answer your questions and really talk more about the great business we've got here in Canada. (Event Instructions)</p><p>So just briefly on the programme. We've got a day of management presentations here in Montreal where the -- which is the hub and headquarters of our business, our aluminium business here. Wednesday and Thursday, we're travelling to North America's low carbon aluminium hub in the Saguenay. And on Friday, we're visiting the world's largest critical minerals and metallurgical complex at Sorel-Tracy.</p><p>This is a brief overview of the agenda for today. Firstly, after the safety share from Mike, Will's going to give us an update on the markets that are relevant to the discussions today, and then we'll go for a deep dive on the Aluminium business led by J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me and his leadership team.</p><p>There will be a 45 minute Q&amp;A session following the first half of the day. And there'll be also a break during that first session and we'll have lunch. After lunch, Sophie will talk to us about our Iron and Titanium business, and Mike will talk about the Iron Ore Company of Canada. And we'll close with Nigel, who'll give us an update on everything we've been doing in the technology space. Please focus your questions on the preceding session and note this agenda when considering your questions.</p><p>Here's the speakers. There's also many of the other leadership in the region in the room, and they'll also assist in the questions and in discussions. And I encourage you all to introduce and meet as many of them as you can today and at the various events we've got during the week. Just before I hand to Mike. So the slides will be on our website. We will be recording the audio of the presentation today and making a transcript available for those who were unable to attend.</p><p>And with that, Mike is the CEO of our Iron Ore Company of Canada business. He is going to complete the land acknowledgement and also do a safety share. Thank you.</p><p>MIKE MCCANN, PRESIDENT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, IRON ORE COMPANY OF CANADA: Thanks Tom. I'd like to start this morning by mentioning that Montreal Tiohti\u00c3\u00a0ke is situated on the unceded traditional territory of the Kanien'keh\u00c3\u00a1ka, Mohawk Nation, also known as a gathering place for many First Nations. We recognize and respect the Kanien'keh\u00c3\u00a1kaas, the traditional custodians of the lands and waters on which we meet today.</p><p>As always, within the mining industry and any industry, we look at safety and very -- in light of -- it's the first thing we talk about in the morning and we'll do that in this conversation as well. So here what you see is the Labrador West forest fire. I want to give you a little context of what actually occurred there this past July. So on Monday, July 8, that evening we had a lightning strike. It was approximately 25 kilometres west of Labrador City.</p><p>So that fire burnt for a while, kind of stayed within that area. As Friday morning approached, the fire was being managed. So we're monitoring, we still had operations. However, we started getting heavy and strong westerly winds later in the afternoon.</p><p>And actually in Friday afternoon, I think it was around 4:00, 4:30, the town of Labrador City made an emergency request for an evacuation. Within that time span of the morning and the afternoon, the fire moved 20 kilometres. And that fire encompassed about 130 square kilometres. And it ended up on the doorstep of Labrador City with about four kilometres space to go.</p><p>From that, our employees, as well as the town of Labrador West, was evacuated. As you can imagine, within Labrador West, there's not many nearby towns to go to. So it was about a 400 kilometre drive to Goose Bay with no gas stations. So a lot of emergency preparedness went in place in terms of ensuring through the province that we had sufficient fuel for the exodus of about 10,000 individuals to Churchill Falls -- or to Goose Bay, sorry.</p><p>So what did we do within this process. Number one. First of all, we put a business resiliency team in place. And this is a practice process for us during emergencies. And within that business resiliency team, we coordinated a very rapid shutdown of our operations to put them in a safe state. We moved the majority of our heavy equipment into the pit and we ramped down our operations.</p><p>This business resiliency team stayed in place and at site. We had about 12 to 14 individuals that stayed in Labrador City. There was a emergency team from the municipality of about 10 people that stayed in the city. Everything else was shut down, the hospital was down, the food from the grocery store was down. Nobody could come in, nobody could go out.</p><p>Because of the experience of Rio Tinto IOC in terms of dealing with emergencies, practicing emergencies, the municipality didn't have much experience with that, so we actually really coordinated well with the mayor of the town, coordinating activities and linking in with the provincial government and working quite closely hand by hand. And when we needed equipment to help make fire breaks and whatnot that was provided.</p><p>During that time, you can imagine a lot of stressful families, two weeks, very, very short notice to evacuate, and the stress on families, you can imagin the stress. So Labrador or Goose Bay is about 6,000 people, and you have an influx in 10,000 people. You can imagine the stress on the systems and whatnot was going on there. We donated $125,000 during that time to the Canadian Red Cross to assist with their efforts in Goose Bay.</p><p>After the fire was made all clear, it took about two weeks. We did have a ramp up of the operations still with our business resiliency team, and we got back into operation a fairly quick manner. But whenever you take something down quickly, there are challenges in bringing it back up.</p><p>So some of the learnings that we had over this period of time, it's imperative to have strong relationships with your stakeholders, and you need to work on those strong relationships constantly throughout the life of your operation. Because when you need those relationships, especially in times of emergency, you can really lean on them.</p><p>That evening, I had a call from the Premier of Newfoundland saying, whatever you need, Mike, we're here to help you out. And that's based on two, three years of building up that relationship over time. And secondly, is your business resiliency team and continually testing your emergency preparedness plans. You don't know what's going to hit you. You don't know how it's going to hit you. And having those robust plans in place, doing scenario planning, running dry runs of those scenarios is invaluable.</p><p>With that, that's our safety share. And please enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on to J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE - ALUMINIUM, RIO TINTO PLC: Thanks, Mike. Good morning to you all. I'm J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me P\u00c3\u00a9cresse. I joined Rio Tinto almost a year ago now from General Electric, where I used to run the global renewable energy business, and I'm now based here in Montreal to run our global aluminium business. Thanks to be here to join us for my one year anniversary party in this beautiful Indian summer weather that we have here in Montreal.</p><p>I think it also makes great sense to be here, given the big footprint that Rio Tinto has in the region in North America. And we are the largest metals and mining company in North America. We are also here in Quebec, depending on the year, the number one or two industrial employer. We mine, we process, we explore a very diversified portfolio of minerals and metals in North America. And you have the list on this slide.</p><p>We have around 18,000 employees. And North America in total represent 25% of Rio Tinto's production on a copper equivalent basis. And last but not least, I mean, Canada is a hub for a very large part of our global aluminium production with unique competitive advantage, which we'll discuss today and which you will see tomorrow in Saguenay.</p><p>But before we discuss it, I'll hand it over to Will, who is going to go through our markets.</p><p>WILL MILLSTEED, HEAD OF MARKET ANALYSIS, RIO TINTO PLC: Thanks, J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me. Good morning, everyone and welcome. My name is Will Millsteed, and I'm Head of Market Analysis for Rio Tinto, based in Singapore. I'd like to share with you today a few thoughts on how we're seeing global aluminium, titanium and high grade iron ore markets. This will be complemented with more detail from Amy, Sophie and Mike later in the presentation.</p><p>Before getting into it, I'll share an anecdote to build trust and to get you all to believe everything we're about to tell you. At a recent team building workshop, a colleague had to describe me using three words. They used, tall, clever, and direct. I shared that with my wife, who thought it was pretty funny and about right. So for the next 15 minutes, I will try to deliver on that description.</p><p>I can guarantee that I will be tall and direct. I'm going to tell you why I like our industry and Rio's place in it, and I'll do my best on clever but can't promise anything. Maybe you can give me some feedback later in the day. Let's move to the first slide.</p><p>What we've got on this first slide is not a new message, but I think it bears repeating. Put plainly, the in-situ stock of commodities in the physical environment around us is ever growing, and this is fundamentally driven by three things. The first two together, population and wealth.</p><p>Regardless of all else, more of us requires more homes, more workplaces, more transport, more power and more health and education facilities. And increased wealth simply amplifies these wants and needs.</p><p>The third factor is the most complex, what we could simplify to call commodity intensity, and it is governed by how we choose to live. Are we deploying our wealth into products or services? Do we invest in capacity to make supply chains more secure? Do we live in harmony with our environment, rebuilding things differently, or with new tech or recycling to secure a sustainable future? So let's unpack these factors a little.</p><p>The incredible growth experienced by China since 2000 has been a huge driver of commodity demand. I think the stat that best represents this astonishing transformation is that China accounted for 70% of global industrial production growth from 2000 to 2020.</p><p>China became the world's factory with unprecedented formation of capital, and in the process grew its industrial production, or IP, over eight-fold during that period, compared to the advanced economies who combined grew less than 10%.</p><p>From now, though, the limelight shifts from a single star to become a diversified global story. China continues to grow from a higher base, albeit, at a slower pace. Other emerging markets, including ASEAN and India, will contribute heavily, accounting for 70% of urban population growth and almost half of global IP growth.</p><p>And advanced economies are getting a boost from the energy transition and bolstering supply chain security. They will expand manufacturing and account for almost 20% of global IP growth, a huge step up from the previous period. This is a significant change in industrial growth dynamics, the beginnings of which we are already seeing. Now let's move on to a couple of specific drivers which support metal intensity in coming years.</p><p>Firstly, auto demand. The growth of private vehicle ownership in lower income and emerging economies will be a driver of industrial production and commodity demand. As you can see on the chart on the left here, vehicle ownership is generally correlated with incomes taking off slowly at low levels before accelerating above 10,000 per head and levelling off at around a vehicle for every two people.</p><p>And notably, about 85% of the world's population is yet to peak and plateau. This translates to the current stock of vehicles increasing by around 600 million to 2040. On the right chart, the longer term outlook on global auto sales remains positive, and as auto sales grow, the shift from internal combustion engines or ICEs, to electric vehicles will continue. EVs now account for almost 20% of new auto sales globally. The pace of adoption varies across countries, with China leading the way at about a third, followed by Europe at around 20% and the US at 10%.</p><p>We'll get into some more detail later, but this trend will be beneficial for metals such as copper and ali. An EV currently uses three to four times more copper than an ICE, and about 10% to 20% more aluminium is needed, with some putting this estimate up to 85% more depending on the region and the vehicle. Now on to the energy complex.</p><p>The world continues to build renewable power generation capacity at pace. Solar and wind currently account for 5% and 8% of global electricity generation, and will grow as the world continues to build capacity, especially in China, the US and Europe.</p><p>In the network and energy storage segment, the average investment per year in the last seven years has been around $360 billion, or around $2.5 trillion total over the last seven years. Regardless of which external source you want to look at, and there's a few, this is only going to get stronger for longer. Estimates range from around $550 billion a year to $900 billion a year. And this is to be sustained for decades. We are talking tens of trillions of dollars being directed towards upgrading generation grids and storage.</p><p>Now let's move into some commodity specific specifics. Firstly, aluminium. Ali demand growth in the next five years will be mainly driven by industries connected with the green energy transition. EV's share in ali consumption is expected to increase to around 13% by 2028. Meanwhile, the electrical sector, including solar, wind, transmission and distribution will become the second largest end use sector after transportation with a 19% share.</p><p>Improved casting technology is expanding, with more automakers investing in new equipment, allowing larger aluminium body parts to be produced to lower the cost of EVs. Aluminium intensity and passenger EVs will increase by around 50% from a little over 200 kgs at the moment to over 352 kilos by 2050. As I mentioned, upgrading and construction of grid infrastructure will also continue to drive demand. This will boost demand in the electrical sector by about 30%, or over 5 million tonnes, in the next five years alone.</p><p>Region wise, demand growth will become a lot more evenly spread, reflecting the changing industrial dynamics I just described. North America will add 2 million tonnes of demand over the next five years, at a solid annual growth rate of 4%. This will be supported by 2% growth in the rest of the global North, adding another couple of million tonnes. The Global South is expected to add 10 million tonnes at an annual rate of 3%. Amy will touch on this a little more in her presentation later. Now let's look at how the world will meet this growing demand.</p><p>While the world still needs more primary metal, the growth in recycled metal demand will outpace the uptake in primary metal. This is mainly driven by the rising consumer demand for increased recycled content and the wide range of decarb targets set by governments globally.</p><p>Global scrap consumption growth will likely average around 3% annually to 2028, while primary consumption will be about 1-percentage-point lower at 2%. This will take the share of recycled metal in total ali consumption from 30% in 2018 to around 33% by 2028. And now moving on to the outlook for primary production.</p><p>I often get asked, do you think China will adhere to its cap of 45 million tonnes of primary aluminium capacity? The simple answer is they already are. China put the cap in place back in 2017. The cap has been adhered to now for seven years, with any new aluminium smelting projects constructed only through replacement licences of other existing capacity that has been decommissioned. Given these actions to-date and current government rhetoric, we expect adherence to the cap to continue.</p><p>Consequently, primary alloy capacity in Shandong Province is expected to continue to fall to 5 million tonnes, down 4 million tonnes from 2018 as it is predominantly coal-fired. And conversely, Yunnan's capacity, which is mainly hydro, will rise to 8 million tonnes by 2028. So the world ex-China needs to produce more primary ali to meet demand. So let's move on to the next slide.</p><p>Despite capped primary supply in China, the construction of new primary aluminium projects in the rest of the world is limited and I mean relatively higher smelter CapEx and limited access to renewable energy sources. So the increase in primary output instead will likely come from capacity restarts in Europe, Central and South America, North America and Australasia, supported by lower energy costs and elevated margins.</p><p>What new capacity is built will mostly be powered by non-renewable power located in the Global South. Growth in global low-carbon aluminium supply will be muted at just 1.2 million tonnes by 2028, and this includes restarts. Now, taking a look at what this does to the industry cost curve.</p><p>A bit later on, Jona and Nigel will take you through our decarb efforts and Ulric through the financials of our assets, so I'll keep this pretty high level. The aluminium operating cost curve is expected to move up slightly steepen and reshuffle through to 2040 on higher carbon penalties. Scope 1 emissions will be difficult to abate and account for a little under two tonnes of CO2 for every tonne of aluminium.</p><p>Carbon penalties on Scope 2 emissions will be offset to some extent by higher penetration of renewable energy. To the extent that this doesn't happen or is slowed, this curve will be steeper, building in an even greater de facto premium for greener aluminium.</p><p>Fossil fuelled smelters, predominantly in Asia, will be at a cost disadvantage to smelters able to use renewable energy. In sum, I'm pretty constructive on the aluminium market outlook and the team will elaborate more shortly. But Rio is well positioned with considerable production of low carbon aluminium in the portfolio. Let's move on to titanium.</p><p>Titanium is mined and then processed. 90% of it is processed into TiO2 pigment by two methods, these are sulphate and chloride. You can think of these texts like diesel and gasoline for your cars. Both sources will move a car, but they're different. Also, once you've selected which one you want, you have to keep buying the same fuel to keep the car running.</p><p>The largest end use for titanium is paint and more particularly white paint. This accounts for over half of titanium demand. Titanium is -- titanium dioxide, rather, is great for opacity and aesthetics. Good quality paint has a high loading of TiO2. If you use quality paint, it'll look better and you only need one coat. It's also good at reflecting UV. That's why titanium is important.</p><p>Like many commodities, China has been the main growth driver in recent years. Other major markets are the US and Europe, but these are more mature. More recently, we've seen rapid growth from India, which has been running at about 7% over almost the last decade.</p><p>Tio2 has stable long-term demand growth. Not only is it driven by new construction, but there is a strong repaint market in DIY. So the next time you repaint your apartment or your front fence in white, please know blue or green, you know you're contributing to growing titanium demand.</p><p>Other markets are paper, plastic, and metal. Metal is one we get queries on a bit, given the links to aerospace, which is growing quite strongly, but this is only a small share of the market at about 5%, but it's supportive nonetheless.</p><p>There are no inorganic substitutes that can touch the opacifying properties of titanium pigment. There have been some inorganic substitutes that were under development in the 90s, but they haven't been successful in penetrating the market. It's also hard to peel paint off walls, so recycling is limited. Moving on to pigment and feedstock supply.</p><p>As mentioned, 90% of mined titanium is processed into TiO2 pigment. Over the last two decades, China's capacity build out has led to it becoming the dominant midstream processor. China has significant reserves of titanium, which is mined as a co-product to iron ore in Sichuan. This along with feedstock imports, has underpinned its rapid expansion.</p><p>In the early 2000s, China's growth was to meet its own domestic demand. However, over the past decade it has become a huge net exporter of titanium pigment. This has come at the expense of the Western world, which has struggled to compete on cost. However, there is still solid feedstock demand in North America and Europe, which are recently benefiting from import tariffs on pigment.</p><p>In sum, I like this industry. It is categorised by steadily growing broad based demand with limited recycling or substitutes. Alongside this demand growth, we expect around 400 kt of depletions to 2030. This will create market opportunities for RTIT. Sophie will elaborate later on how our operations are flexible and how we serve customers in these markets.</p><p>Moving on to high grade iron ore. Given that steel is basically indispensable in our daily lives, the imperative of decarbonising the steelmaking process will progressively increase the value of higher quality ores. In the long term, a technological solution to decarbonise iron making using mid-grade and lower quality ores will be required. In the meantime, direct reduction is the only existing and proven pathway to reduce the steel industry's carbon footprint.</p><p>Currently, the traditional blast furnace basic oxygen furnace steel production route generally generates approximately two tonnes of carbon for every tonne of hot metal. This compares to the DRI EAF route, which produces about 1.2 tonnes, or even less if hydrogen is used as the reducing agent.</p><p>Reflecting this environmental advantage, demand for high grade feedstocks, in particular pellets, is growing. Demand for blast furnace or BF pellets is expected to grow in Europe, as steelmakers seek to increase efficiency in the burden mix and reduce carbon consumption. Demand for direct reduction, or DR pellets is expected to more than double, as nearly 50 DRI modules are being built globally, adding 110 million tonnes of capacity by 2030.</p><p>The qualities of North America's iron ore endowment and its technological expertise position it at the forefront of expanding the supply of direct reduction pellets and pellet feed to domestic and export markets. North America has sufficient BF pellet capacity to meet domestic demand, but a gradual shift towards DR pellets is underway, driven by decarb efforts. In this context, IOC has options to respond to demand growth. Mike will take you through this a bit later.</p><p>Finally, I'd just like to wrap up by hitting three key points. First, more people with more wealth means we need more homes, shops, cities, schools, hospitals, cars and energy. The phenomenon isn't new, but it is relentless and ongoing. Second, there are considerable tailwinds from decarb and securing supply chains. Reconstructing entire supply chains in new ways is very commodity intensive.</p><p>Third, China has been the growth engine for global industry for the past 20 years. The next 20 will see that growth shared across regions and particularly here in North America.</p><p>Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to chatting later in the day. I'll now hand back to J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me to introduce our aluminium business.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: Thanks, Will. And also up to aluminium. I think for the next 90 minutes with my team. I thought I would just start by sharing my conviction that aluminium is a key differentiator for Rio Tinto and it's a great business to be in. This is the first reason when I decided to join Rio almost a year ago. And every day I get more excited by the potential of this aluminium business.</p><p>I mean, the markets are supportive as Will has explained. We have great teams and you will see some of my leadership team during these two days. And we operate from a position of strength. And if I go in more detail on that, you will see on the next slide that we have a portfolio of world class, primarily low-carbon primary and secondary aluminium assets. That's a big element.</p><p>Second, these assets give us a privileged access to some of the key and the most profitable markets for aluminium in North America, Japan, Korea, to name a few. Third, we have, in aluminium, a very robust technology foundation stemming from a long history in the industry dating back from Alcan, from Pechiney, from Elysis.</p><p>And forth, we have unique and strong relationships with the government and the communities wherever we operate. So that's the base. And I think on top of it, we start from a foundation of good progress with the actions that have been engaged with my predecessor. I mean, sometime you join a business and you just see you have to like turn it upside down and do very different things.</p><p>In aluminium, I think it's just about continuing on the journey we are in, on preparing the action and bringing that business to a next level of performance, and I think it can be done building on what was engaged during the last few years. And just to mention two items here on this slide.</p><p>The first is the repowering of our Pacific operations. This is under way, and as you will see, it's not only done to help Rio Tinto to meet its CO2 reduction targets by 2030. Repowering this specific operation will allow them to be more competitive for the long term, so it's also a competitiveness play.</p><p>Second, about operational excellence. It's a topic I've spent a lot of time during my GE days under Larry Culp. I'm convinced it's a journey. I'm convinced that it's a cornerstone to creating a long-lasting competitive advantage. And here also, we start from, as S\u00c3\u00a9bastien will explain, decades of experience.</p><p>And by developing our safe production system faster and everywhere we operate, I'm convinced that we can get ahead of the competition and get the business to our full potential. And this is going to be a big part of S\u00c3\u00a9bastien's presentation.</p><p>So back to our footprint. We have our global aluminium footprint on this slide. As you see, we operate a global supply chain, starting with our bauxite mines in Australia on Cape York, but also in Guinea and in Brazil. We also have two big poles of industrial operations, alumina refining and aluminium smelting, here in Canada and in Australia and New Zealand. Importantly, we have important research centres in France and in Canada, and you'll be hosted tomorrow on our research centre in Saguenay.</p><p>And you can also see on this slide our metal core processing site, which produces secondary aluminium in the US and with one site in Canada. So this is our global footprint. The other thing I would say on this slide is that if you count, we have 14 smelters in which we own the controlling or non-controlling participation. 11 out of these 14 smelters run out of renewable power.</p><p>And number 12, which is Boyne smelter in Australia, is on the way to be fully powered by renewable at the expiry of the current contract by 2029, and we are working on the last two on the list. And we have in total in the world around 15,000 employees.</p><p>Safety of these 15,000 employees and safety of the contractors which work on all our sites, our minds, our plants, every day is where it all starts. So I thought I would just spend a few minutes on safety. It's obviously the primary area of focus for the team, an area of leadership engagement at all levels, starting with myself and down to the front line.</p><p>And it's a place where we continue to drive every day of the week more process, rigour. It's about learning from every incident we have, doing a real deep root cause of these incidents and fixing it with a proper engineering controls. Then by relying on the fact that every worker will make the -- will do the right thing every day of the year. So that's the journey we are in.</p><p>And as you can see here, our performance is probably close to industry leading on safety. I mean, we have AIFR which is our ratio of loss-time accident per 200,000 working hours at 0.3, and that's quite a low level. And the source of prize this year is we had no severe accident year-to-date for employees and contractors in our control operations, and we only had one what we call potential fatal event with injury. So that's quite a good safety record that again, we work every day to improve.</p><p>But safety is only a part of our impeccable ESG vision. And second reason I joined Rio Tinto is this impeccable ESG vision driven by Jakob, which aims at transforming our company. This vision is about safety, but as you can see on this slide, it's also on a number of other fields. It's about environment, our water emissions, our air emissions and our global environmental footprint.</p><p>It's about our people driving diversity and inclusion, making sure that we are a company where people can talk freely and give the best of themselves every day. It's about our partnerships. We are stewards to the land where we operate, and proper collaboration with traditional owners, with First Nations, with government is not only about our license to operate, it's also critical to our success going forward.</p><p>And finally, it's about our product offering. Amy will explain our journey to produce the lowest carbon aluminium in the world, fully traceable up to the bauxite mine. And Jonathon will discuss our decarbonisation journey for primary aluminium. And we are also developing an offering with secondary aluminium all over the world. I'm absolutely convinced that this ESG vision, and in particular, our decarbonisation journey, will be a core competitive advantage in our markets going forward.</p><p>And talking about decarb, I just want to spend a few minutes on this slide. Yes, decarb is about reducing our CO2 emission, which is the most critical driver for Rio Tinto to meet its objective to reduce CO2 by 50% by 2030. But it's also moving to the right part of the cost curve, as you can see here.</p><p>In Canada, we have smelters already sitting on the good side of the cost curve, thanks to our unique assets, which provide renewable power at very competitive terms and give us almost self-sufficiency. when I say it's our Quebec operations and you will see a Shipshaw tomorrow. We have hydro dams providing us around 90% of our power needs today.</p><p>And in Kitimat, our Kemano powerhouse in normal hydrology level, which is not the case today, give us more power than what we need to feed Kitimat. So we are almost self-sufficient in Canada. And just to give you an image of the magnitude of what we operate in Canada, we take water from watersheds which have a size bigger than Belgium across Canada. So it's quite big, it's quite impressive. And continuing to invest in these hydropower assets is a big part of our CapEx every year.</p><p>In Pacific, we are not there, but we will get there and we are moving down to the left part of the cost curve. I mean, we have made significant announcement of the repowering on Boyne smelter. There is more to come. But what we see today is a clear path for Boyne to move fully with renewable powers in the second quartile of the cost curve.</p><p>At the same time, you have seen we renegotiated our power contract in New Zealand for our NZAS smelter, also securing a place for that smelter in the good half of the cost curve.</p><p>Last but not least, I think it's important to say that our aluminium smelters are such a big part of the energy markets wherever we operate, that it's going to generate for us a significant source of value creation going forward. And maybe it's something that we can come on in the Q&amp;A, but we are playing an aluminium game. I think more and more we are also playing an energy game.</p><p>So that's about our costs. Next, talking about our production. One source of satisfaction, so far in the year is that we have recovered from issues we could have years ago in Kitimat, in Australia, and thanks to the good deployment of SPS, thanks to the rigour that we are driving in all our processes. We have stabilised now production at record levels for bauxite and aluminium and very close to the full capacity for primary aluminium.</p><p>For bauxite, we are guiding to the high end of the guidance this year, and this around 56 million tonnes will be almost an all-time record and very good progress versus the previous years. For aluminium, we are guiding to the midpoint of the range at 3.3 million tonnes. That's also going to be an all-time record.</p><p>Looking at financials. We have just put a few numbers on this slide, and Ulric will come back on it and will give you a more forward-looking view of our financials. But you can see here that we have an EBITDA margin over the last five years, which is well above competition.</p><p>We have an average ROCE over the cycle at 7%, which is too low. So our big focus is to find levers to improve this ROCE and firmly establish it in a two-digit territory, which we think we can achieve and Ulric will come back on it.</p><p>And we have generated, in average over the period, $2.6 billion of cash flow from operations, half of which has been dedicated to investing in our assets. Finally, on the right part of this slide, as you can see, the share of the total free cash flow of the aluminium industry, which we represent had grown very meaningfully between 2019 and 2023. So we start from a decent place, and Ulric will comment on our improvement journey.</p><p>Coming back very quickly on our market. I won't spend more than a minute on this slide given the background that will give you. But just want to reiterate my confidence in the growth of our markets, particularly our core US market for primary aluminium and for secondary aluminium driven by the energy transition.</p><p>I think we are also set to benefit from the reindustrialisation of North America and from the current geopolitics. And looking at how important aluminium is for the energy transition and knowing that topic, because I spent probably 11 years in the renewable energy industry, I believe low carbon aluminium can be the next copper.</p><p>So I'll come back for the conclusion and for the Q&amp;A. But after this introduction, this is the agenda for the rest of the aluminium presentation. So Amy Abraham with our commercial leader will go through now our product offering for primary aluminium, but also for recycled aluminium, and in particular our strategy towards more and more value added products and the way we see Matalco integrating into our product offering.</p><p>And then she will continue on our bauxite and alumina integrated value chain. And that's a two-fold topic, as you know. It's about securing bauxite and alumina for our smelters, but it's also about our profitable third party bauxite business into China. So Amy will cover that. And then S\u00c3\u00a9bastien, who runs our Atlantic operations, will discuss our best operator journey.</p><p>As I said, this is where we spent most of our time every day. This is where I'm trying to bring a bit of learning from GE here. And this is absolutely critical to our success. Having the right mindset, having the right trigger, having the right processes and deriving it from the front line.</p><p>Then S\u00c3\u00a9bastien will also discHappy to hand it over to youuss the partnership we have with the communities where we operate, and he will touch a bit on technology. We live most of the technology discussion for Nigel later in the day and also for tomorrow in Saguenay.</p><p>So don't be frustrated if you don't have enough of technology today. We thought it would be better to come on aluminium smelting technology and how we drive improvement in some presentation that you will have when you get to Saguenay tomorrow.</p><p>And finally, Jonathon, who runs our global decarb initiative for Rio Tinto, will cover our energy plays and our decarbonisation journey. So that's the agenda for the rest of the hour. I'll come back for conclusion and Q&amp;A. Happy to hand it over to you, Amy. Thank you.</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM, VICE PRESIDENT, SALES ALUMINIUM, RIO TINTO PLC: Good morning. I'm Amy Abraham. I'm the Vice President of Sales, which covers global sales of bauxite, alumina and our products globally. Like J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me, I'm fairly new to Rio Tinto. I joined just over two years ago. I spent 30 years in the energy industry, 30 of which was with BP, and I think it makes a lot of sense. It's a very similar value chain.</p><p>We find stuff, we dig it up, we put it through a refinery, we transform it some more, and we sell it to some customers in a sort of value-added orientation. And of course, as you've heard, energy is extremely important to this business and the future.</p><p>So I'm going to cover two things. I'm going to kick us off talking a little bit about our competitive product offer. And then I'm going to conclude with our integrated bauxite and alumina supply chain. As Will mentioned, this is a really, really exciting industry to be in right now. aluminium is growing like crazy on the back of these newer trends in electrification and decarbonisation.</p><p>Demand is growing across all regions and for both primary and recycled products, as you heard, with demand for recycled products growing slightly faster than for primary. And if you look at the bottom of the chart, you're going to see that all of our markets are actually structurally short, which means that within each of the three regions, demand exceeds supply, especially if you look at US and Europe.</p><p>And this is really important because the supply and demand deficits will drive market pricing both on an absolute and as well as a relative basis as markets compete for that last marginal import ton.</p><p>Against this backdrop, North America is the most attractive region or market. It's extremely large. It's one of the largest markets in the world. It's growing at a rate of 4%, and it has an increasing deficit and will rely increasingly on imports with this imbalance growing from 1.3 million tonnes in 2003, up to 2 million tonnes by 2028.</p><p>And while there have been a lot of investments -- sorry and while there have been a lot of investments in secondary production, many announcements, especially on the billet and slab side, there have been very few in primary, it's pretty costly. And in fact, if you look at the US, the primary production has actually been shrinking and the US is down to four primary smelters these days. These dynamics are going to support sustained and higher revenue availability in North America as compared to Europe and Asia.</p><p>As a producer and as a sales, having the majority of our book here in North America, Rio Tinto is going to benefit. We've got our geographic proximity to this fabulous market, making low-carbon materials out of Canada. 75% of our global sales are directed towards North America.</p><p>So we're going to benefit from these higher revenues. We've got - given our geographic proximity, we're going to have lower freight costs. And we also benefit from tariff exemptions by selling from Canada into the US and even Australia into the US.</p><p>Looking at our products, we're well positioned in North America from a product perspective as well. We've got a unique and diverse portfolio. And this also provides a competitive advantage to us. As you can see, the demand for all of the aluminium products are also growing significantly, whether these are recycled or primary. And while recycled capacity is available and it is growing, it's not happening, as I mentioned on the primary side.</p><p>So we're going to have this structural short not only within the region, but we're also going to have it on the -- for each of these various primary products. And the structural short further supports higher revenue per ton.</p><p>For us, we're well positioned versus competition. And there are three major reasons for that. One, we're the leading producer in the region with many of our sales directed, as I mentioned, towards North America. But we're also the top three producer for all of these products, with the exception of one, which is slab. And this position has been enhanced with our recent joint venture with Matalco, which I'm going to talk to in just a second.</p><p>And unlike many of our competitors, who only produce one or two products shown on this chart, and they only produce recycled or primary, we do all of the above. And we have this great diversification of low carbon primary and recycled products. Thirdly, our portfolio has a greater weighting to value-added products. And the value-added products are the slab, the billet, the foundry, the rod. And they allow us to capture higher prices and margins relative to sales of remelt. And we capture higher prices relative to commodity imports.</p><p>Additionally, this diversification gives us great access to many of the growing market sectors. We've talked about auto, we've talked about electrical, even packaging. So we've got exposure to all of these sectors. My favourite product amongst these is rod, as you can see. We talked about this. This is what is rod. It goes into making wires and cables. It's part of that fantastic electrical sector that's growing at 7% per annum. And we're going to see the most growth there with the exception on the auto side.</p><p>Rod has very few substitutes. As you can see, there are no recycled substitutes for rod because of conductivity purposes. We need those. We need that primary. So with that, we -- it commands higher prices and we're well positioned. Again, we're one of the leading rod producers in North America. And we've established fantastic relationships with some of the largest cable makers in the US.</p><p>And with all these great products, we approach the market with a value orientation. Many of our customers approach it from, I just want to sell volume. I'll sell it at the lowest cost. We approach it a little bit differently because we take advantage of this competitive advantage that we have.</p><p>We focus our efforts on those customers and those market sectors that are growing that have the greatest profit potential, the biggest profit pools, but also the greatest willingness to pay for the products and services that we're providing. So consequently, our unique and diverse product portfolio and the choices on how we go to market not only provide value oriented growth, but they actually provide, I would say, profit protection through the cycles.</p><p>So now about Matalco. As you guys know, in December of '23, we took a 50% stake in Matalco, which is North America's one of North America's largest producers of recycled aluminium. And it's been a fantastic addition to our portfolio. We've been working on integrating Matalco into the team, into our book through the remainder of this year. And we're really getting ready to go to market with them for '25.</p><p>They make very high quality billet and slab products, value-added products. They've got six facilities in the US, one in Canada. And they produce -- they have capacity to produce 800,000 tons of aluminium per annum.</p><p>So this takes our North American production to about 3 million tons. And again overweight our sales of value added products into this market. My team is accountable for selling remelt to them. It gets blended with scrap and recycled products are produced. But we also take everything that they're making in combination with everything that we make in Canada. And we go to market as one unified sales team now.</p><p>So starting in '25, we're going to be marketing everything. Those conversations have started. The focus as we look at Matalco in terms of what do we want to do with that business to create more value for them? It's about capturing more business with their existing customers. It's about focusing efforts on prospecting for new customers, but also about enhancing their value proposition by bringing our technical capabilities, R&amp;D capabilities, but also this ESG orientation to how we go to market with their products.</p><p>So again, very exciting joint venture. Recycled aluminium is going to represent about 50% of overall demand towards the end of the decade, growing at a rate of 5% per annum. So a great opportunity for greater growth for us.</p><p>The Matalco joint venture definitely enhances the value proposition that Rio Tinto already had in North America. And this value proposition is kind of the second leg of our competitive advantage. And when we do it well and we go to market well, it supports retention. It supports new customer capture, greater share of wallet and also price premiums.</p><p>What you see here are the things that we think set us apart from the competition as laid out by our customers and our annual surveys. And there are five main levers that we think -- that we focus on, that we think set us apart. One is our technical value and use. The second, our ESG offerings, supply chain security, being a nearshored producer and sales organization, our trading capabilities and now with Matalco, additional services that we can provide.</p><p>Starting with technical, we work very closely with our customers and our customers' customers to develop new alloys, new products for new applications, and to support them in their own manufacturing processes to reduce costs and improve productivity. We often support our customers in producing products that they can't do themselves.</p><p>Looking at ESG, we're blessed. We have these fantastic advantages of having hydropowered assets in Canada. What does this mean? It means that our carbon that we are selling in North America is 50% less than the North American average for the region, and 70% less than the imports that are coming in that are needed for that structure -- to meet that structural short.</p><p>We positioned ourselves to be a leader in a market shaper in this space. We're making investments in zerocarbon smelting. That's going to be ELYSIS. Now it's about recycled products in combination with this already low-carbon aluminium that we -- that's already been part of our book. And we're not just stopping there. We are supporting our customers with traceability, certification of our carbon footprint from the mine all the way to the castle's gate.</p><p>The joint venture with Matalco strengthens our value proposition that we've been working on for a number of years, and these areas are covered in the blue. The first thing I'd mention is an enlarged access to a complete portfolio of billet products. The second is the addition, a sizable position in recycled products that really sets us apart from competition, and again, allows us to have that continuum from low carbon to lower carbon to even zero carbon and everything in between with blends.</p><p>We have new offers that we can make to our customers. Scrap take back, tolling services. We have trading capabilities that we can offer to them as well. And overall, our customers benefit from this enhanced supply security that we both provide because we have redundancy in our network. We take all of our smelters, we add their casthouses, and we can now provide redundancy from a supply chain perspective.</p><p>Looking inward, this joint venture provides a number of synergies which underpinned our value case, our business case, and which we are already starting to deliver. We've had some great successes in '24 and we're really looking forward to '25. And these are typically coming in logistics, production optimisation, sharing of best practices.</p><p>So a couple of things come to mind. You know, you take a billet product, orders come in from customers. We now have a choice. Where do we want to make it? Do we make it in Canada or do we make it in the US? If it's more of a recycled, friendly product, we'll make it in the US.</p><p>Raw material, it'll be cheaper for Matalco and logistics costs are going to be lower going to the customers. And we'll move those products into Canada. We'll take their orders for more specialized products, and we use our scale advantages and our capabilities to get advantages there.</p><p>We often -- the second thing that we're leveraging is we -- some things we make off-spec products or we make shapes that we struggle to sell in the US and we often ship to Europe. So we can now, instead of shipping those to Europe and taking a discount, we can give them to Matalco. They'll buy them at a slightly higher price, but at a very competitive price in the US and everybody wins. So some great synergies between the two companies.</p><p>As I mentioned, we've set ourselves up to be a market shaper, not a follower. And earlier this decade, we've started reaching out to develop deeper relationships with our customers' customers. We've been lending our know-how to support their product and platform developments and support their ESG goals. They've really been concerned about supply chain security of critical minerals, with aluminium being one of these.</p><p>This has culminated in a number of MoUs which have opened doors for more directed sales and a more directed -- more direct approach to support demand pull through for our low carbon materials, primary and now recycled. Our focus is now on monetising these MoUs. The one I'm spending a lot of my time with is BMW, and we've already started to see quite a few successes with them. They've started to direct their purchasing and supply to us both in Mexico and North America with their semi manufacturers.</p><p>We've also started a lot of R&amp;D technical services work, working with them on new products, including blends of our low carbon aluminium recycled products from Matalco and Arvida Centre that's coming and our ELYSIS materials that we have some in inventory and qualifying these for new platforms. They love our technical services, they love our low carbon solutions, and they like our -- and they really find our partnership approach attractive. And this is really starting to pay dividends.</p><p>So in conclusion, we're well positioned in North America. We've got a lot of competitive advantages. We've got our diversified product portfolio. We've got a unique value proposition. This has definitely been enhanced with the Matalco joint venture. And we have the leading impeccable ESG credentials and a low-carbon intensive product portfolio.</p><p>On this last note, I'll just say the market's continuing to mature, but we're really starting to see a lot of green shoots and interest and willingness to pay coming through. And these ESG credentials, as I mentioned, have opened a lot of doors, not only with new customers, but our customers' customers, those OEMs.</p><p>And with that, I'm going to turn to what I think is actually a simpler part of what I do, which is bauxite and alumina. So we're going to move upstream a little bit. We run an integrated value chain on bauxite and alumina. And this underpins our Atlantic and Pacific smelting and casthouse operations that I've just been talking about.</p><p>Starting with alumina. This is the key raw material, of course, that goes into smelters to make aluminum, or aluminium if you're outside the US. And we currently produce between 7.5 million to around 7.5 million , 7.7 million tonnes per annum. The majority of this aluminium goes to feed our internal smelters, to feed our joint venture partners, to fulfil long-term contracts that we've had in place and with a little bit left over, typically around 500 ,000 to 1 million tonnes a year.</p><p>We think of alumina as being a tolling business, and we aim to keep our global alumina book balanced to slightly long to manage supply risks. That said, as you can see in the chart, our supply position is much longer in the Pacific and it's much shorter in the Atlantic. Not a problem. We've successfully managed these regional imbalances through our commercial best practices.</p><p>We use physical swaps, third party purchases and sales, as well as physical movement from the Pacific into the Atlantic to manage this. And we're always looking for options in the Atlantic to minimise future risks. This is not a money making business. It's a tolling business. It's all about supply security at the lowest cost possible while minimising price and volume.</p><p>Next, I'll turn to bauxite. Rio Tinto is the world's largest bauxite producer through its wholly owned mines in Australia, CBG in Guinea, and our joint ventures in CBG and Guinea and MRN in Brazil. The chart below -- the chart that you see shows our movements of bauxite to the various geographies, as well as our resources and reserves.</p><p>MRN Bauxite in Brazil supplies the Alumar refinery and it also, along with CBG bauxite are critical feeds to our Vaudreuil refinery in Canada. We produce around 50 million tonnes. The majority of our bauxite is in Australia. A third of that goes into our refineries, our two refineries in the Gladstone area, Yarwun and QAL, with the other two thirds sold into China on a third party basis. And these third-party bauxite sales have contributed significant revenues and cash flows to our aluminium business over the years, and we believe will continue to do so.</p><p>I'll leave you with we have sufficient reserves in Australia not only to meet our internal requirements of our internal refineries, but to support new initiatives and definitely to support the needs of the Chinese seaborne market. So not only are we the world's largest bauxite producer, we're also the world's largest seller of bauxite into China.</p><p>And why is China attractive? So China is extremely reliant on imports. Chinese imports have been growing exponentially over the past ten years. And even since 2019, they've grown by 55 million tonnes a year, with imports now representing about 70% of Chinese requirements. Since 2023, you'll see that 20 Indonesian supply has disappeared, leaving their only options to be Australian and Guinean bauxite for their import requirements.</p><p>At the same time, kind of the double whammy is that their domestic production has been declining, all of which high reliance on imports, lower domestic demand, all of this has been supporting import prices. And import prices are up approximately $12 a tonne since 2019 and have been increasing every single quarter since the post-COVID lows of '19 -- of 2022.</p><p>And Rio Tinto has captured our fair share. We've successfully demonstrated the capture of these prices through our quarterly bilateral negotiations quarter-on-quarter in line and in excess of our value in use. Why are they paying more? They appreciate the diversification of Australia. And they love the technical services that we're providing to support them in their ESG goals.</p><p>Looking to the future, we remain very bullish on sales into China. Three reasons for this. One, they're building new aluminium refineries on the coast as domestic inland domestic supplies reduce. And these new refineries will take either Australian or Guinea bauxite. That's good. Even with the 45 million tonne cap in place, again, domestic supply is declining, which is going to require higher imports going forward.</p><p>And lastly, as I mentioned, Chinese customers want that diversity. They don't want to put all of their eggs in one basket in Guinea. They want more Australian bauxite. And they've told us they want more bauxite from Rio Tinto. And I think the great thing about this is that our Amrun mine has been permitted to 50 million tonnes per annum, which is going to give us opportunities to not only meet our internal needs, but to address future Chinese needs as well as appropriate.</p><p>So in conclusion, we operate a reliable and integrated alumina and bauxite supply chain. Our alumina book is balanced. We have sufficient bauxite reserves to meet our internal needs as well as address future Chinese import requirements. We continue to look for sourcing and sales strategies to provide book diversification and minimise long term risks. Again, I think this is well managed. And again, we're in an advantage -- another advantage position supporting our successful products business.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to turn it over to S\u00c3\u00a9bastien Ross, who will kick us off on the journey to best operator.</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC OPERATIONS ALUMINIUM, RIO TINTO PLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Thank you, Amy. I'm Sebastien Ross. I'm the Managing Director for Atlantic Operation Aluminium. Since I close to three years already, six years in Rio Tinto. And I had a background in automotive industries, transportation industries and office furniture industries, most of the time in operation. So it's my pleasure to be with you today and also to host you in Saguenay-LacSaint-Jean for starting tomorrow and Thursday.</p><p>Today, as J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me mentioned, I will cover essentially three topics. The first one, our best operator ambition. The second one, how do we leverage technology in our asset. And the last one, I talked about, our main partnership. So let's start with best operator.</p><p>So we're fortunate in Atlantic to have a long tradition legacy of continuous improvement. As a fact, we have over 700 trained black belt and green belt in the organisation. But with SPS last year, this year, essentially, we have decided to uplift our people and to invest much more in the development of the capability in terms of continuous improvement.</p><p>We went from 200 days on average, the baseline is 2022, when we had started SPS a year of training to over a 1,000. But it's only the beginning, so we will carry on in 2025. And with these renewal of uplifting, it's allowing us to increase the deployment pace across our site. And you see on the right-hand side graph, all our Canadian sites will be under an intense deployment phase of SPS by year end, and the exercise will be completed by 2027.</p><p>I talked to it as a project. It's not a project, this is a culture, this is a mindset., this is really, really important. And when we enter in a site in order to tackle the right priority first, we're getting where is the most value at the beginning. So we're using benchmarking, cost benchmarking, looking in the market, looking across our site the best in class and this is what we try to tackle.</p><p>You have probably seen in our half year results that our bauxite production has gone up by 10% versus last year, same for aluminium at 3%. So I will provide just a few tangible examples on improvement structural we have made underpinned by SPS. It's only quite a few, but we think this one -- we felt this one were representative.</p><p>I start with -- on the upper left on the graph. This is our Laterri\u00c3\u00a8re smelter. You will be in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean tomorrow, but Laterri\u00c3\u00a8re, this is a site in the pot room. Normally when you are entering in the summer period, we have a lot of students. There is heat waves. Normally we have stability issue in that site. This is a site where we have deployed intense SPS practices. We have chosen with the employee seven practices to be deployed.</p><p>And when we're looking, we're after the summer now. The last summer we improved stability index by 25%. Just to give you an idea, stability index, this is a matrix we have. Essentially what it is, is the percentage of shifts on which you're able to apply your standard work as planned. So it's really important in the pot room to increase stability. So 25% uptick this summer and a 5% year-to-date on the site.</p><p>Another example, we run numerous Kaizen. Kaizen again, quickly, it's a cross-functional team working for a week from the beginning to the end, we're talking about a few months, and they're tackling issues, and they're proposing a solution to be deployed. In Laterri\u00c3\u00a8re again, we had a very important shutdown on eight rectifiers. And what the team has started looking into it with the engineering, it was 14 days, the duration of the setup.</p><p>So imagine 14 days you need to reduce the amperage in the pot room for eight rectifiers in the same years. So they managed to find a solution to make it in 2.5 days, which has allowing us to increase the output year-to-date by 5% versus the plan.</p><p>Another example on the right-hand side, this is Alma. Alma, we had aluminium silo. And our reaction normally is to ask the engineering to make a project and to make us a proposal. And finally, with SPS, we have decided to put a team in a Kaizen, and we went through a shutdown time of three months to five days, and we had a cost avoidance of 25 million only on this one. So SPS is providing tangible results on the stability on HSE, but also on the engagement of the employees, which is really, really key.</p><p>Provide an example also for my colleagues in backups in bauxite at Amrun. We have achieved a lot of very positive things in Amrun in the last 12 months, a lot of successes. But it has started by the commitment of the leader to deploy SPS, but to combine our SPS effort with an asset management uplift to take care for our asset.</p><p>Essentially, they have done two important Kaizen, one in feet of the site. We're facing a lot of instability. In our business, instability, it's not good. So we need to be stable. So they put a team working together. Again, they came up to a solution and by the implementation of that solution they were able to increase the feed rate and reduce the variation by 9%.</p><p>Also, they put a team working on a shutdown, a bit similar to that my two previous examples. And they were able to reduce the shutdown intervention by 610 hours to 381 hours.</p><p>So as a result, when we're looking at Amrun today, the last quarter, we have a record production and it keeps going the last two months. But also what we notice in the site, I said SPS has an impact on the engagement. We felt a change in the mindset of the people.</p><p>Now they felt they were allowed to try to make mistakes as long as you're able to understand the risk level you're taking, because what's an anecdote into it, the solution they managed to find for the first Kaizen at the in feed has been tried in the past, and they fail. So they retried again. They managed to find a better solution and now they've been successful. Again, ideas come up from shop floor normally are the most practical and the less expensive we have.</p><p>Another element on best operator. We have an integrated productivity programme. Essentially, we're tackling every digital improvement, AI improvement. This is a committee that governs the capital allocation. That committee is in place since a few years. So you see the amount of initiatives and the associated EBITDA we're able to generate.</p><p>But when we had started SPS, we discovered quickly that when something is requested by the employees being a digital tool and you're able to deliver quickly on this, it has a rate of adoption, very, very high. So we have decided to add a pillar on our IP programme, which is support SPS deployment.</p><p>I may also provide another example, in UGB, one of our cathouses in Grande-Baie. What's important in a smelter? This is the timing between the exit of the pot room and the entrance in the furnace. So they develop a planning tool with SPS team with the IP team, in order to reduce the waiting time at the furnace by more than 75%, with an impact on the AUR you see reaching historical level.</p><p>So in conclusion, for the first section, we have a long history in terms of continuous improvement in RTA. Now SPS is really rooted after three years in our continuous improvement mindset. We're increasing the deployment of our initiative.</p><p>We're also leveraging digital tools in order to be quicker and have tangible results in SPS. Also, as I mentioned, we tackled where the value is first leveraging KPI benchmarking, and the whole purpose of it is to empower our frontline to move us forward.</p><p>I switch to the second topic, how do we apply a technology? So the graph you see here in the last decade or so. So we had technology. We're developing technology and we start at a certain, let's say, amperage. And by improving the pot design, the anode design, the pot controlling system, we're able to gradually increase the current we put in the pots. And increasing the current in our business means more production.</p><p>And if I'm taking it at the RTA level since 2008, we create our side by more than 400,000 a kiloton, which is a site very close of the hallmark capacity in equivalence. So that's really, really important. Also we're doing it for the technology we developed by our own. But in two of our sites we have competitors technology. We've done the same in P155 in UGB in Laterri\u00c3\u00a8re to reach the limit of the technology.</p><p>The cell productivity AP60 on which we have announced an expansion. I cover it right after. This is the most productive pots per square metre we have in the industries. So Nigel will build a little more on these elements during his session.</p><p>So you will have the chance first day to visit the construction site of AP60. So we must put the context where in the context of we have an hedging facility called Arvida, getting to a closure. We will have a progressive closure of Arvida. It has started essentially this year because we shut down the first line last April. It will go from this year to 2028. And AP 60, this is a transition project for Arvida. Again, an important project.</p><p>The project is going well. We're 30% completed on the project and you will see it firsthand Thursday or Thursday morning. What I would like to highlight it's almost a ton for ton replacement project, AP60 for Arvida. And it's reducing the CO2 emission by half for the same tonnage, which is again significant.</p><p>Now I cover - there is more than AP60 in the repurposing of our Arvida facility. We have also announced a recycling centre. So essentially we would be the first primary producer in North America incorporating post-consumer scrap in this production. This is a $29 million investment that will be in operation in about a year and a half from now.</p><p>We have also announced a demonstration site -- ELYSIS demonstration site. This is a total investment of $285 million. This is a joint venture with Quebec government. Quebec government will have 40% of the share on that site. Essentially, this is a demo plant. This is -- Nigel again will explain it much more details. But normally this is one of the first stage of the demo. So it will be ten pots, essentially of 100 kilo amp. This is a technology that's been successfully demonstrated at our ELYSIS research centre last year.</p><p>We will learn how to install the technology. We'll learn to operate the technology and that term we will be quicker on the full scale technology deployment. These three projects are very important to ensure a proper transition of our Arvida factory.</p><p>In conclusion, on that section, technology is a core strength. As an example, 30% of the smelter outside China are equipped with our technology. We have continuously improved our technology, and the plan is to continue to do so with the technology. Like ELYSIS, repurposing of Arvida site is a good example on which we're taking one of our oldest assets. We're repurposing having a very positive impact on the CO2 emission. And now more and more we're progressing with the new technology adoption with partners.</p><p>Let's talk about partnership now. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see some pictures of the engagement we have with First Nations through Canada and through Australia. This is really, really, really important. It's important across the globe.</p><p>But I talked about Canada for a minute to understand and respect the indigenous right to be respectful, to be transparent, to work with them because they have a very important role in the natural resource development. So partnership with them is essential in order to get more certainty in the project and to gain speed.</p><p>In Quebec operation, we're operating on the Nitassinan territory of the Pekuakamiulnuatsh, the First Nation community. But on this tomorrow, I'll be with you again. I'll provide you much more details while we're in Quebec operation factory. We'd like to touch quickly. We have a big site Kemano, Kitimat on the West Coast in Canada. So BC Works smelter is located on the unceded traditional territory of the Haisla Nation on which we signed in 2010 the Haisla Legacy Agreement.</p><p>We have also the Cheslatta Carrier Nation on which we're engaged in reconciliation since over a decade, and in 2020, we have signed a New Day agreement. Another example of our implication or involvement with the First Nation indigenous people around the country is that we work alongside as a partner with the First Nation Major Project Coalition to advocate for Canada's first national indigenous loan guarantee programme that has been announced by Government of Canada in the budget earlier this year.</p><p>And just to provide a few numbers, BC Works. Over 500 million in British Columbia, we're investing 3.2 million inches the local community initiative. We have 1,100 people and more than 400 indirect contractors.</p><p>Now, talking about the partnership with government, I think J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me mentioned it in one of the first slides, how it's important the relationship with government and First Nations. We're the largest mining and metal manufacturing company in North America, so we know the importance of having that closer relationship. And I really do believe we're in a good position.</p><p>A few examples. We have alignment on some house policy touching the climate, the industry, the tax policy. For example, we have a general consensus on the need to act on climate change with a shared goal on net zero by 2050. But also we have a recognition through the tax policy of Canada that support the unique position we have Rio Tinto being the biggest, largest hydro producer in Canada.</p><p>Another element is through ELYSIS. Both Canada and Quebec government has invested in 2018 and 2021 for Canada through the Strategic Innovation Fund and through Investissement Quebec, they have invested also, plus they have invested in our demo plant in Quebec, and we had a very strong support of Quebec government on AP60, USD113 million.</p><p>So in summary for me today, I talked about the best operator. Again continuous improvement is well rooted through SPS. We're accelerating the pace, and we're leveraging the potential by benchmarking ourselves with the external market and amongst our own smelters.</p><p>Technology is really a core strength. And again, I'll let Nigel provide you more details. And historically, we have always leveraged our technology position. And I remind the importance of a very good relationship with both First Nation and the government to strengthen our LTO, but also to further develop more projects with them.</p><p>Thanks for your attention. See you all tomorrow in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.</p><p>JONATHON MCCARTHY, CHIEF DECARBONIZATION OFFICER, RIO TINTO PLC: Thank you, everyone. My name is Jonathon McCarthy. I'm the Chief Decarbonization Officer for Rio Tinto. It's a global role that we created 18 months ago based in Brisbane. So thanks everyone for making the long trip up here. And thanks particularly to the Australians who have brought the weather with them it seems, maybe don't get used to that on your subsequent visits.</p><p>I wanted to start by talking a little bit about just my career in Canada. Just to give you some context, I started as an operations engineer with Rio Tinto. A number of our product groups, iron ore, our old energy business. And I've had also the opportunity to work in Canada.</p><p>And I hope that over the coming days, you'll get the opportunity for those who haven't spent as much time here to really understand and appreciate the opportunity and the ease of doing business here, particularly in this energy transition where we can see a new leg of opportunity and value creation coming from Canada.</p><p>As I said, my role is a global role, and this team is put together to effectively develop and then select and prioritise and execute our transition investments globally. And that's giving us an added advantage with a number of global options we can learn from different parts of the business and what we're doing. We're not doing this in silos. But equally, it means that we can prioritise for the best value.</p><p>And what I wanted to share with you today is not just about going low carbon, but is also about making sure our business is stronger and more competitive as we come through this transition, and we create value for our regions and our stakeholders where we operate.</p><p>Today, I won't talk about the global portfolio. I'll focus on aluminium. And aluminium is an excellent showcase for these factors: a lower carbon business, a more competitive business and a business where we can strengthen our partnerships. That's where we'll focus the attention today. But I'm very comfortable and encouraged discussing on the rest of our decarbonisation plans as we spend the next few days together.</p><p>Why aluminium? It really, really is at the core of a net-zero Rio Tinto. Firstly, already today, 72% of our renewable energy -- of our energy demand at Rio Tinto comes from renewables. A big part of that comes from Lac-Saint-Jean and the Saguenay region that S\u00c3\u00a9bastien spoke about. But we also have renewable powered smelters and a growing fleet of renewables in our global operations.</p><p>But on the other side of the coin, aluminium also represents 74% of our Group's emissions. And principally, this comes from the Scope 2 emissions at Boyne and Tomago smelters in mainland Australia, as well as the anode effect from the production of aluminium. And Nigel will talk you through how ELYSIS is looking to change that after 100-year history in that industry, as well as the coal and gas that we use to raise heat and steam in the production of alumina.</p><p>Pleasingly, in this product group, we have a clear plan towards net-zero. We know where all of the carbon is. At the bauxite mines, it's in the electricity that we use and the diesel. In alumina, it's for heat and steam, and in aluminium it's for electricity and anodes. And we know what we need to do for each of these, and the task at hand is to prioritise that in a competitive way so that we can make these businesses stronger this decade and set ourselves up for those breakthroughs into the next decade.</p><p>Probably the most pleasing thing for me in this role in the last 18 months has been that the era of roadmaps has finally finished on carbon, and we've entered the era of action. We've finally been able to take a number of steps that convert what has been talked about for a long time in global circles, into a set of concrete actions that start to take our footprint down towards 50% at the end of the decade and towards zero in 30 years.</p><p>In northern Australia, we already have a 5.6 megawatt solar farm installed in Weipa, and we have three others in planning and construction right now, two in Gove and one in Amrun. And that's the bedrock of taking us off diesel-fired power -- diesel-fired electricity in those remote sites.</p><p>We're also leveraging that global nature of how we're doing this, by taking in what we can do with either biofuels or electric fleets, to look for pathways to decouple our bauxite mining fleets off oil and off high carbon emissions, particularly important in Australia with rising safeguard liability legislation on the use of fossil fuel powered fleets in that region.</p><p>More importantly, alumina has a much bigger footprint than bauxite, and you'll recall from the prior slide, alumina and aluminium is where most of the carbon sits. In alumina, the roadmap is quite clear and we're taking steps across all of it. First, we must reduce the emissions and the energy use at each refinery. And this is critical if we're to change how we use energy, we want to start with a lower energy footprint before we make those changes.</p><p>The best evidence here is that Queensland alumina refinery in Gladstone. We have a project which is double digestion. We effectively keep 80% of the heat that we inject right at the start of the process, and run the bauxite through that at a lower heat than we do today.</p><p>This takes 30% of the energy demand out of the future of that refinery, and therefore the commensurate emissions reduction, as well as the liabilities under carbon schemes in Australia. That project right now has guaranteed grant funding from the Australian government and is set up in final feasibilities to move towards construction.</p><p>We're also doing a lot in the calcination process of alumina. The final step of alumina uses high heat natural gas to take what is a hydrate product to a final calcined alumina product. And today, globally that's done always with natural gas.</p><p>We have two options that we're pioneering at the moment. Right here in Quebec, we're pioneering and looking at the option to go to electric calcination. And that relies on a low cost, reliable green power grid, which we're able to enjoy here. But equally in Australia, our team of engineers and scientists a few years ago created a breakthrough, which we call hydrogen calcination, replacing that natural gas with hydrogen.</p><p>And right now there's a pilot plant under construction at Yarwun, together with Sumitomo, who is our delivery partner, and again backed by Australian government funding to honour that breakthrough and look to set up a hydrogen -- to be the cornerstone customer of a potential hydrogen industry in that region.</p><p>And in aluminium, we've already spoken a lot publicly about our efforts to repower and recontract how we use energy in our fossil fuel powered smelters in Australia, as well as ELYSIS and that breakthrough technology.</p><p>I want to speak a little more about that repowering process, because it's been a long time, and some of you in the room have been talking to us about this for many years. And so it's not lost on me that it has been a long process. I've been fortunate to be a part of it for over four years myself. Why is it taking so long and what does it involve?</p><p>We've had to change how we contract energy to make the most of this opportunity. And for some time, I think it was seen as a massive threat to those smelters. They have traditionally run on the endowment of low cost coal in the regions where they operate in Queensland and New South Wales, and we needed to reset what it is, is going to make them competitive in this next era.</p><p>And so smelters in that region have always had what is called a load following contract. We contract low cost electrons for a long period, under the proviso that we only get that price if we take the electron for aluminium. And that means that your capability to change how you use energy with that facility is quite limited.</p><p>In this new era, what we've done is, firstly, we have now secured 2.2 gigawatts of wind and solar, and there's more to come with battery storage as well. Those are pure PPA contracts. Rio Tinto and our partners will have the capability to pull on that energy. We have the rights to that energy for the next 20 years.</p><p>And in that, we've unlocked an opportunity where prices are low in the grid during the day, we can use as much as we can of our owned energy and aluminium to produce aluminium, to congeal that electricity into aluminium and store and sell it to the world.</p><p>And when prices get high in the evening periods and other peaks, we have an opportunity to use our collective contract base to sell some of that energy, giving us some profit from that book, but also helping to flatten out the price volatility in the market around us. It's a win for the industry. It's also a win for the region. And that's why you see people and groups like the Queensland Government supporting this initiative and this major investment from Rio Tinto.</p><p>Having that set up gives us a second option in how we use energy to create value and genuinely get those assets into that second quartile of cost curve. As we are working on right now and the research centre that you'll visit tomorrow, we can look to flex and modulate how we use energy more and more throughout the running of the smelter. And it's been a technology that's been difficult for a number of years. But it's also struggled with the financial incentive owing to the contract structures I just described.</p><p>In this changing world, there is more and more imperative from our stakeholders and from our shareholders to become good at that. And if you can consider that we can take that flexibility and that capability in the future to further enhance our ability to take low cost power out of grids at certain times of the day for value and to create aluminium, and then to modulate and flex our demand, creating more value in those higher cost periods to become a net seller.</p><p>Making our business competitive in the transition is clearly paramount. And I spoke before about the many years it took us to get there. A lot of that was to make sure that the solutions are competitive. It's not just enough to be low carbon. This isn't just important to Rio Tinto, though. It's important to everyone.</p><p>There's an acknowledged agreement with all of our stakeholders and the governments we're working with that those smelters must thrive in the transition. They must have the cash flows to support reinvestment, safe asset health and strong regions. And we are genuinely conscious of how we tackle this transition must benefit all of the stakeholders in the region.</p><p>I referenced earlier the Gove solar farms. Much effort was put into citing what was effectively a fairly simple ten megawatt solar farm next to the mine has now been moved to two 5-megawatt solar farms near the two parts of the Gove township. So as we reach mine closure, those solar farms have a much better enduring positive impact on that region to provide energy into the local grid there post mining.</p><p>And for that little bit of effort, we've created a much better outcome and buy in for First Nations communities and the local community there, are small but important example of the changes that can be made to create benefit for everyone as we deploy these assets.</p><p>In New Zealand, there's some great examples of how we've repowered that. It's an excellent story for the future prosperity of New Zealand aluminium smelter. But we've also been able to step away from purely contracting with the hydro in the region to also contracting 75 megawatts of wind that will come into that system, new jobs, new energy growth and new partnerships in Southland.</p><p>Further, in New Zealand, we've been able to secure an energy demand and flexibility response mechanism in that contract. And this is really important for a New Zealand grid that is moving away from fossil fuel firming and more volatile weather patterns, where the smelter can actually play a role in keeping the lights on in New Zealand. And the right compensation sits between the parties so that everybody takes a win from that capability.</p><p>Gladstone, we've spoken about. But at its core, we have become the underwriter for the largest wind and solar projects in Australia. And that's not gone unnoticed with our partners. And it shows that by pursuing a competitive future for that asset, not limping along into the next decade, we've been able to get the right partnerships on board and the right support from federal and state governments.</p><p>And right here in Quebec, S\u00c3\u00a9bastien already spoke about the enormous support that we've had over a number of years with the Quebec and Canadian government, and I think you'll see that right now in the energy transition, we can see that that's a new era of potential partnership. We run our grids together. We're co-investing in innovation together, and we feel privileged and supported to be able to set Canada as one of the foundational pieces of how we will create value in this transition.</p><p>In summary, for me, I really find that I spend a lot of time around the world, only ever talking about CO2. And we didn't put carbon at the core of our Group strategy just to make our impact on the planet, but we also did it to make ourselves a stronger business.</p><p>Decarb is at the core of how we're operating and more so than ever in our aluminium business. But it's about doing it in a way that creates a competitive bedrock for our business into the next era and our regions. And I hope you'll enjoy what you see in the next few days. And perhaps some of you are able to visit some of our actions in Australia. But this is no longer a roadmap. This is no longer a strategy. This is a set of real actions that are starting to transform the future of our company.</p><p>Thank you. I'll ask Ulric to come up and speak about the aluminum financials.</p><p>ULRIC ADOM, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ALUMINIUM, RIO TINTO PLC: Thank you, Jonathon. So I feel we've been gearing up a bit for this part of the presentation, so I'm sure I wrote my part on that. So first, I want to thank Jonathon for the partnership that we've been having in what he calls competitively decarbonising assets. And I'll come back on those elements. But again, this balance of our social license and what we want to do from a decarb perspective and the target that we assign ourselves, but also how we do it in a competitive manner to ensure the, I would say, the longevity of our asset for the next 20 years. Again, thanks to Jonathon and the team for that.</p><p>So my name is Ulric Adom. I'm the Chief Financial Officer for Aluminium. I joined Rio Tinto six years ago. Before that I spent 14 years in the pharma industry. You can ask me how you transition from pharma to mining during the pose. But -- and for the past six years, I started first in Brisbane in our exploration, major capital project and closure space. And I've been the CFO of Aluminium for now, a year and a half. And I have to say, to compete a bit aggressively to get the role, it's a personal choice on my side. But I'm certain by now you understand why.</p><p>And if I summarise a bit, first, you have heard from great people. So great, dedicated, very competent people running this business. Second, a very strong financial track record and obviously I'll come back to some of those elements. Third, supportive market. I think Will really demonstrated some, and Amy also, how we want to leverage some of those market dynamics.</p><p>Fourth, a unique product offering. And you'll see that with this unique product offering, we are generating above average margin in our business. Fourth, and S\u00c3\u00a9bastien alluded to that and covered quite a bit of those elements, very disciplined application on operational effectiveness and lead management that create also a competitive advantage. And lastly, Jonathon just covered our competitive decarbonisation.</p><p>So look, if I start first on our financial track record, we have -- and J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me covered at the beginning our average performance over the past five years. We have split this performance across the three components of our value chain. First, our bauxite mine, then our alumina refineries and then aluminium smelters. A couple of elements on this performance.</p><p>First, you can see now that our bauxite mines are solidly generating above 30% of EBITDA margin and will continue moving forward. Second, our aluminium smelters that generate the bulk of our operating cash flow are now establishing a floor above 20% of EBITDA margin.</p><p>Third our alumina refineries, certainly one of the most challenging part of our business. And we know we have had some operational issues last year. This year we've been dealing with the gas issue in Gladstone. Nevertheless, those refineries have been consistently generating positive operating cash flow and now are now on track to generate low double digit EBITDA margin moving forward.</p><p>So what does this financial track record tells you on the way we want to manage our financial performance moving forward? Before coming to our own view of those financial aspects, I think it's important to take a step back and look at the cycle in the aluminium industry.</p><p>So if you look at the up chart is the LME price since 2010, and the bottom chart is the operating margin of the third quartile smelter. A couple of observations that I think are important to make at this stage. First, you can see that the cycles are quite wide apart. And we mentioned in the comment two to four years apart in terms of when you see those spikes in the price of aluminium.</p><p>And generally those spikes tend to be short in duration, generally between two to four months. And I would say the average between -- I would say the long run average of LME and the spike in price is around anywhere between 20% to 60% in terms of long run average to peak price. And I think it's fair to say that the industry has not been responding in an agile way to those cycles. And that translates into those very low margins that you see at the bottom for the bulk of the industry, notably driven by supply stickiness.</p><p>Obviously, we want to change that paradigm and all our approach has been to how do we capture and position ourselves to capture more of the upside and to be structurally above average from a financial return perspective across the cycle, giving more predictability to our business and structurally improving our profitability.</p><p>So that's our aim. Our aim is to deliver industry-leading, sustainable, predictable return across the cycle. We believe that the combination of operational stability, competitiveness and disciplined capital allocation is structurally improving our ROCE, our return on capital employed. And I'll cover in the next slides each of those components.</p><p>I think there are two elements obviously when you think about return on capital employed. First, the numerator. And on the numerator, we are driving two elements. First, our best operator agenda. And what does that mean in terms of EBITDA margin? Second, our product offering that drives also our gross margin and then flows into our EBITDA margin as well. So that's on the numerator side.</p><p>On the denominator side, it's all about disciplined capital allocation. And three components in our disciplined capital allocation. The first one is the trade working capital, and I'll come back on that. The second is what we call disciplined and prudent capital allocation. We are a capital-intensive business. You need to invest capital to maintain the health of your asset. But we can do that in a very disciplined way. And we have shown that in a track record, and that's what we will do moving forward as well.</p><p>And third is applying growth investment. Well, how do we capture those opportunities that the market offers? How do we safely replace also the returns, both at a bauxite mine but also at aluminium smelter. And again, all of that operational stability, competitiveness and capital allocation translate into a structurally higher return on capital employed.</p><p>So if I start by our best operator agenda, a couple of elements here. You see on the bottom of the chart, those are the fixed cost element. The red element are variable cost. And then you see our gross margin evolution and you see EBITDA margin which is the lower part of the graph.</p><p>So a couple of elements to our best operator. The first element in terms of how we want to structurally enhance our EBITDA margin is to first work on our variable cost. So we have a global procurement organisation within Rio Tinto. We have also a global shipping organisation for air freight. And we've been working quite closely with the teams to basically take advantage of our competitive position and really capture all the opportunities that we can on our variable cost. I'll give some recent examples.</p><p>We have now expanded our supply of third-party anodes for our smelters. We were used to have supply coming notably from China. We are expanding to the Middle East. And we continue, and the idea is to again to drive lower cost of this anode supply. We are also on acoustic. So it's one of our main inputs in our refineries.</p><p>On acoustic, we are now focusing on Tier 1 suppliers and again driving a competitive advantage from a pricing standpoint. And we've been able, thanks to our marine organisation, to also capture many opportunities in our freight, basically improving our CIF price and the full price that we're getting, notably for our bauxite, but also the way we are shipping obviously our metal across the globe. So that's one on the variable cost. And I'll come back on the gross margin on the aspect linked to revenue.</p><p>The second element is to drive a discipline, what we call the fixed cost leadership. And I think there are two elements to what we are driving here. The first element, S\u00c3\u00a9bastien talked to you about our Safety Production System and our competitiveness agenda. One of the elements that you will hear tomorrow, notably for someone called Alex Perron.</p><p>And I encourage you to, when you see Alex on scene, to really focus on what he's saying is how we are driving better productivity in our smelters focusing on throughput. And what we're doing here is really benchmarking ourselves to the best technology out there. So we split, for example, we have AP40 technology at our Alma smelter, at our Kitimat smelters.</p><p>We are not the only ones that have an AP40 technology. For example, there's Sohar. We are shareholder in Sohar in Oman and there's other technology. So we break down the performance of those AP40 smelters through technical KPIs. And we are shooting for the best-in-class across all of those elements. That drives the productivity agenda. So basically, generating more efficiency at the same level. And that's half of the uplift that we'll see in the years to come.</p><p>The second part of our agenda is around fixed cost. And here again, if you refer back to some of the examples that S\u00c3\u00a9bastien has provided in terms of how we drive competitiveness, how we drive the lean mindset, the Kaizen. It's basically increasing our ability to absorb inflation. That's what it means from a cost perspective, is we're improving year-on-year.</p><p>And as we are improving year-on-year on how we operate, as we give the opportunity to the frontline to bring solutions at a lower cost, we are driving year-on-year improvement. And those year-on-year improvement allows us to absorb inflation.</p><p>And the last piece that I want to cover in our best operator agenda and how we are improving our EBITDA margin is what Jonathon referred to in terms of competitively decarbonising our asset. In plain financial terms, what do we mean by competitive decarbonizing?</p><p>It means that all our smelters, including our smelters that will be decarbonized like Boyne, need to be able to generate an EBITDA margin above 20%, because that's at this level that you can then know that your smelter will be competitive across the cycle and will allow you to invest in asset health. That's what it means at the end of the day. And it's a question of not only the power price, but also the role that we can play in the energy market where we operate.</p><p>So when I combine all those elements acting, on the variable cost, delivering a productivity agenda and a competitive agenda, leveraging our position in the energy market, we are targeting a structural uplift of 5% --of 5-percentage-point of EBITDA margin by the year 2030. And it's not like, okay, now you are at zero and in 2030 you'll be at plus 5%. We are well on our way across those years to continue to improve this EBITDA margin. And the result that we have generated this year show that we are on track to deliver this target.</p><p>So let me come back now to the revenue line and our product offering. If you take a step back, the way we think about our production. So we produce primary aluminium. And part of this production stays what we call P1020 is the remelt and the other part are the so-called value-added products, so our VAP share. And we've been flexing the share of our VAP production across the years anywhere between 40% to 60%, with an average around 50% depending on the market opportunities out there.</p><p>And when you think about Matalco. Matalco is a pure secondary VAP play that will again add to this VAP share in our production. And what does this VAP share in our production means? It means getting access. And notably, if I combine that with our geographical access here in the US to the most profitable market in the world, it means that you structurally have -- you have a structural ability to generate price above the commodity price. So that's what we have been doing consistently across the years. And now for the past five years, we have exceeded the LME price by 20%.</p><p>And we'll continue to do so and we'll increase our ability to capture this upside. And there are two ways to think about this upside. Obviously, there are the market location. So for example, in the US we are capturing what we call the US, the Midwest premium. And it's just a fact, as we have seen, the market is not balanced in the US. So they need to attract product. So their ability to attract product into the US is what drives the Midwest premium.</p><p>But on top of that, our unique product offering means that we are driving what we call product premium. And the way to think about product premium is what's the value of the service that you're providing to your client here? You have the geographical proximity. You have the unique shape, unique product offering, and you have the supply chain security that you're providing to those clients. All those elements drive your product premium.</p><p>And you can see that on average, the product premiums have been around $86 per ton across -- for the last five years. But you can see that they are steadily, in fact, increasing year-on-year. And we are now sitting on product premium that around $110 per ton. And the fact that we are reinforcing our presence here in the US means that will be -- will drive and will have an ability to drive higher product premium.</p><p>So when you combine all of that, we are basically increasing our ability to structurally capture upside versus the LME. I think that's probably the key message I want you to retain on this slide.</p><p>Now, if I turn my attention to Matalco, I think Amy described the acquisition and the strategic rationale of why we have acquired Matalco. So it's a 50% joint venture with Giampaolo Group. And as you know, Giampaolo Group, not only ha Matalco in its portfolio but also a scrap provider called 3M. So we are also securing the scrap feed into the secondary producer, which is Matalco.</p><p>So we acquired this share for $700 million in December of last year. That gives us access to a network of seven casthouses with a production capability -- a production capacity, sorry, of 800 kilotonnes, mainly billet and a small production of slab.</p><p>So I think the first element is how is Matalco making its money? And we try to describe a bit this process in the bottom chart on the right-hand side. So I think by now you understand when you have VAP product, you have proximity, you drive product premium.</p><p>Then the question is what's the margin that you're making on the LME plus Midwest premium? And here I think it's important to understand two dynamics that are at play here. Basically, Matalco is producing a billet with around 75% of secondary and 25% -- of scrap, basically, and 25% of primary metal. So you need to procure the primary. That's the first element around the 25% and then the rest of the 75% is the scrap.</p><p>And what we have seen since probably middle of last year and continuing into this year is the scrap spread have been tightening on the market. And that's the -- that's what describes the bottom graph -- sorry, the upper graph here which shows the spreads on the main -- two main type of scrap that we are procuring, the 6063 and the MLCC.</p><p>And I think why does -- if I take a step back and say, okay, why are those spreads tightening? We have seen the PMI in the US contract since the probably last year, and they are continuing. I think PMI last month [147] in the US. And SPMI contract, the availability of scrap and notably of pre-consumer scrap, which is what Matalco is using to produce the billet is reducing.</p><p>And though -- so less scrap, spreads are tightening, so higher cost and your margin is being squeezed. So that's the phenomenon that Matalco is currently faced with. But we do believe that it's a temporary movement because the PMI will rebound. We can see already that there will be some activity rebound in the building and construction with the lower interest rate. And even though automotive is now in a tough spot, ultimately it will come back. And I think we'll have explained those long term market dynamics.</p><p>I think the last aspect which is important is, but how do you see that from a Rio Tinto perspective? And from a Rio Tinto perspective, and I think Amy alluded to that also, is that the combination of the primary and secondary give us a natural hedge, because when Matalco has less scrap, they need more primary. And who's providing the primary? We are providing the primary. And it was part obviously of the way we thought about the synergies when we made this acquisition. So that's the first element.</p><p>The second element, obviously, is that now that we are commercialising the full portfolio across both our Rio Tinto primary, but now with Matalco, obviously our ability to capture a higher premium of the market is what drives part of the synergies. And then the last part are the operational synergies. And now S\u00c3\u00a9bastien and his team are tightly integrated with the Matalco team to drive better efficiencies across the network of casthouses. So that's the combination of those three elements that makes up for the synergies, and we are on track again to deliver by year five of this acquisition, around $70 million of synergies per year.</p><p>And so far, again, we have been on track this year and we are confident on the delivery for next year and to deliver those $70 million by the end of year five. So yes, the current situation of Matalco is difficult, explained by the dynamics that I have explained on the market and notably the tightening spread on scrap. But this will be temporary, this will rebound and will be in a position to fully capture the opportunity.</p><p>So I talked about the numerator, best operator agenda and product offering. Now if I focus a bit on the denominator. And probably here a small anecdote. J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me mentioned that he joined the company a year ago, and I think when he joined, we had a first dinner.</p><p>We spent two hours together, and I was expecting to be quizzed on the profitability of our smelters and what the hell were we doing in Pacific and repowering? Some of that happened, but the bulk of the conversation. So out of two hours, I would say a good 70 minutes were spent on trade working capital.</p><p>So what interests your boss fascinates you. No, but it's really - we've been slowly building and focusing on how we can really improve our trade working capital position. And since then we have really accelerating our view on how we can be more efficient in our use of trade working capital.</p><p>If you place yourself back in 2020 and in the COVID period and in the post-COVID period, obviously there's been inflation, supply chain issues across the system. And so we've been building up what I call excess trade working capital. And a broad value of this excess capital is that we've been here for $1.1 billion of, I would call, excess trade working capital, $700 million of that was priced. So you were building basically in terms of volume, around $400 million of excess capacity. We are now well on track to fully remove this excess capacity. And by the end of the year, we'll be basically done.</p><p>So you will be left with two areas of trade working capital. The first one which I call opportunistic. So the opportunistic is the trade working capital part that you invest to support your product offering. When we talk about VAP, when you talk about flexibility, you need to invest some trade working capital of this. And this will continue moving forward.</p><p>Then you have the structural layer. The structural layer is the trade working capital that you need to operate your asset and to deliver the goods to your client. We have now a deliberate approach to reduce the structural trade working capital. It starts by defining optimal levels of finished goods, spares and in-transit inventory. So we have done that in collaboration with the commercial and operational organisation.</p><p>And now we are driving all our sites to be in those optimal ranges of trade working capital. We are also addressing our efficiency in terms of collection, and obviously we are also delivering with our procurement organisation any efficiency that we can on VAP side. So this will lead us to structurally reduce by approximately 10% our view on our structural layer of trade working capital.</p><p>Now the last piece is the way we invest capital. So I think the way to think about our capital investment. And you see the average. On average over the past five years, we've been investing around $1 billion on our sustaining capital. So really maintaining the health of our asset. And around 3 billion -- sorry, $300 million in what we call replacement, so replacing bauxite or in the case of AP60, replacing the tons of Arvida.</p><p>So this will continue moving forward. But a couple of elements that are quite important to understand as we look forward. The first element that's the bottom graph. You see that there's been time in the past where we have invested above our depreciation level. It was the case notably in 2017 and 2018 when we commissioned the Amrun mine, which was a pure expansion play in the -- in far North Queensland.</p><p>This will not be the case moving forward. So our commitment here in the way we are managing our capital is to cap our level of capital investment at the depreciation level moving forward, and we know there are some important investments that are coming. We talk about our impeccable ESG agenda. We are very deliberate in the way we want to invest, to improve the way we manage tailings, the way we manage water, the way we manage dust. So we'll continue to do that moving forward.</p><p>We also need -- and you have the opportunity to visit our hydroelectricity complex in the Saguenay. Some of those assets are 60, 70, 80 years old. So we need now to reinvest in those assets to maintain this competitive advantage. So -- and as we mentioned also we want to preserve our position in bauxite. So we'll continue to invest. But the commitment as part of our disciplined capital allocation is that this level of investment will never go above the depreciation line.</p><p>So if I put all of this together. Product offering, best operator, disciplined capital management working capital, we are firmly on our way to structurally improve our return on capital employed by 5-percentage-points. And I guess that's probably the message I want to leave you with.</p><p>The market will do what it does. So the prices obviously will fluctuate. We believe that we are in a very strong pricing environment that will benefit for that. That's what you see, (inaudible) but we can be also in a downside. Our approach is to focus on the elements that are under our control, that structurally uplift the profitability of this business. And I'm sure that by now you will understand that we are firmly on our way to deliver those improvements.</p><p>I think I'll hand over now to Jerome.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: Thank you, Ulric. And just one last slide before we go to Q&amp;A. And it kind of tries to bring everything together. We have a strong ambition for this business, as I think you can sense from this morning and hopefully even more during the next few days.</p><p>I believe strongly that at the end, this business has to be the leader in the low carbon production in the Western world, and that it can be the vanguard for Rio Tinto in critical strategic areas in downstream processing and recycling. I'm not going to come back on the right side on our competitive advantage. I think we spend a lot of time on it. It's going to be about executing, in particular on our best operator journey, and it's going to be about deploying our strategy. And our strategic priorities are the five one that you can see on this slide.</p><p>In the first one is becoming a truly global low carbon western aluminium producer. It may make us to do investments provided they produce the right returns in primary, somewhere between our Canada and Australian footprints. And it also means that wherever we are active in primary, we'll aim to have a secondary aluminium position to complement it. Second priority reinforce our bauxite and alumina supply chain. We feel good about our position today, but we think we have to work to make it even more resilient, even more competitive, and even more diverse.</p><p>Third priority is to decarbonise competitively all the steps on the value chain. Jonathon explained how we are working on repowering all our operations. I think that may also be about complementing our hydro assets with onshore wind.</p><p>For example, here in Quebec we made some announcement that we are looking for onshore wind projects in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. And I think when we look at hydrology going forward, probably makes sense to diversify away from pure hydro supply.</p><p>And it will mean deploying ELYSIS at the right pace to make it a great success. And we'll come back on ELYSIS. In the technology discussion later today and tomorrow in Saguenay. It's obviously a very ambitious project in which we believe in, which is just changing the way aluminium has been produced during the last 100 years.</p><p>Fourth priority, create a synergistic and successful recycling business. Our vision is that our aluminium business stands on two legs, a primary leg, a secondary leg, synergistic with each other, complementing each other. And that at the end of the day, we'll mine our bauxite mines.</p><p>But we also get access to the urban mind of aluminium scrap, which is a huge potential for us. We are convinced. Ulric said it. We can come back on it in the Q&amp;A. We are convinced that the Matalco acquisition has a great strategic logic in synchrony with these four strategic priorities.</p><p>And the fifth one is keep maximising the value of our secondary -- of our commercial offering, doing more value-added products and linking primary aluminium and secondary aluminium in the best way possible. So that I think where we will execute in the years to come and with a strong conviction that you will get the business to the great financial returns for Rio Tinto.</p><p>So thank you. I think now, Tom, we move to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>TOM GALLOP: (Event Instructions)</p><p>JASON FAIRCLOUGH, ANALYST, BOFA SECURITIES, INC.: Just in terms of these targets around increased EBITDA margin and increased ROCE. Over the years, we see quite a few of these from lots of different companies, and they tend to just sort of disappear with inflation. So I guess my question to you is are these real numbers? Should I actually be looking at permanently increasing long run margins in this business, or is it going to disappear in inflation?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: These are -- best we don't show it and (inaudible). These ae real solid numbers on average over the cycle. Meaning can we guarantee this number if LME collapses for a year? Probably not, because there are downturns in the market that we will need to weather. Average number of the cycle, it's solid, it's presented to the Board, and there are a set of actions on the numerator and the denominator that we strongly believe in. So they are not going to disappear. I'm not going to come in one year and tell you, by the way, we're not going to deliver them.</p><p>JASON FAIRCLOUGH: (technical difficulty) in ROCE. Can you break down how much of that is a numerator effect and how much of a denominator effect? Maybe Ulric?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: Maybe you can answer that. You may answer and then I'll build up, Ulric.</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: The bulk of our efforts obviously are on the numerator. So that's really driving the EBITDA margin uplift that we have said. And that's really what will drive most of the effort. I think on the numerator, we are trying to be opportunistic and deliberate. So opportunistic is I explained what we're doing on trade working capital. I think we are also always looking at our asset base. Do we need those asset or not, and can we be opportunistic in the way we think about our asset base. But then that's really the discipline part, which is investing at the right level.</p><p>So we know our asset base is going to increase for a certain number of reasons that I have explained, reinvesting in our hydroelectricity, we have some investment coming on ELYSIS. So we need to target our capital intensity, being very disciplined. Then you maintain this base level on your denominator and then you drive the efficiency on your numerator. And that's what really -- that's what makes us confident that this is not something that is disappearing because you're driving hard your numerator.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: Exactly. And just to complement what you said, we feel really good about this. And we spent some time on our strategy. We feel really good on the action on the numerator side. We think we have a strong plan on trade working capital. Then, for the rest of the denominator, it's about what Ulric says, how do we balance the CAPEX need for an asset base, which is large. And you will see tomorrow in Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean that it's not only about smelter, it's refineries, hydropower, electrical lines, trains.</p><p>So some of the assets will need investment. Some of the assets will have to be more tactical and opportunistic. We don't need all of this, we have a number of what we call non-controlled operations, which are minority participation. So I think there are trade-offs that we need to make at the denominator level.</p><p>DOMINIC O'KANE, ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.: Dominic O'Kane, JP Morgan. So a similar question. So on the margins, can you maybe give us a sense of what percentage of your portfolio today doesn't generate a 20% EBITDA margin? And within that, can you maybe give us a sense about how the geographic split exist across the portfolio?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: Alumina refineries.</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: So I think the first is the alumina refineries. And you have seen on the curve, and we don't expect those to reach the 20% margin. I think Amy has explained that we are thinking about this as a tolling business, but we are very clear that they need to generate sufficient returns to justify the level of investment and this precise aspect.</p><p>So I would say that's pretty clear on the alumina refineries. I think on the smelters you have seen, it was mainly a backups play. And as you know, for a long time, our smelters in the Pacific have benefited from cheap coal. And I think Jonathon alluded to that. This has reversed. So that's why it's so important now to drive the competitive decarbonisation.</p><p>So those assets are continue to -- will continue to be challenged over the next three, four, five years as we come to the end of those contracts. And then when the repowering kicks in, that's when you drive those aspects.</p><p>I think we still need to weather the next couple of years for those assets that will continue to be challenged because of their energy contract. But as we move forward -- and for example, that's what we did for NZAS (inaudible) but now it's even more competitive. And then as BSL will enter and obviously we need to work on Tomago and see what's possible here.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: I would say our bauxite mines and probably two thirds -- more than two thirds of our 14 smelters, controlled or non-controlled, are above that mark. Ulric, you would disagree?</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: Yeah. No, I don't.</p><p>DOMINIC O'KANE: And if we fast forward to 2030, should we assume, given the plan, 100% of (multiple speakers)</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: Yeah, all the -- I would say apart from the refineries, all the others will be in this ballpark, that's we are very determined. And that's how we want to manage this business.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And any new investments that we will do would have to have value creation that allows them to be above that metric as well.</p><p>DOMINIC O'KANE: And maybe one follow up. Could you maybe give us a sense about how -- if it's possible, what the step change in ROCE is for ELYSIS? If you're -- so if we're talking about a replacement smelter is -- where does the ROCE come from? Where should it go to?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: I think you should expect ELYSIS to become industrial and commercial at scale not before 2030. I've been -- in my previous life, I've been developing technologies like large offshore wind turbines. I'm convinced that the best way to make them fail is to go too fast. So we are going to -- we are committed to ELYSIS. We are going to develop it step by step.</p><p>And we have two big step, which is this pilot in Saguenay that S\u00c3\u00a9bastien discussed, and also another pilot to do it at 450,000 amperes. ELYSIS is going to be an investment, and hence a return on capital employed drain up to 2030 before it gets deployed.</p><p>PAUL YOUNG, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.: Paul Young, Goldman Sach. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy here in Canada. I know we're seeing Arvida in, I think, tomorrow. But if I just wind the clock back a little bit, say five or six years ago, Rio outlined potential growth at Alma and Arvida, I think was 400,000 tonnes per annum. And the view back then was that you wouldn't commit to any capital in Canada unless the aluminium prices were about USD2,500 a tonne, right, or thereabouts.</p><p>But since then I guess we've seen demand stagnate a little bit in aluminium, but we're actually starting to see some supply side discipline from China and from major producers globally. It looks to me as though primary aluminium supply is not really growing. Secondary is. And it's really now all about supply side discipline and trying to expand your margins.</p><p>But specifically on Arvida, it's a big capital investment, the $1.1 billion. How do we think about the economics of this investment specifically, considering extending the life of production here. Anything you can share with us with respect to breakeven aluminium price or what's the return you're looking at from this investment? How do we think about the returns on this $1.1 billion investment?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: So S\u00c3\u00a9bastien maybe is going to help me here. But we think about it as maintaining the level of volumes post Arvida. We think about doing it with half the carbon footprint and probably reducing our overall air emissions by 90%, which will deserve a premium in the market. And we think about a cost improvement. S\u00c3\u00a9bastien will need to help me quantify because I don't have it right in mind.</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS: I think our AP60 was important. Nigel mentioned it yesterday. Our current AP60 site was a former demo site. We have only 38 pots, so it was not big enough to have, let's say, a competitive price. With that addition of 96 pots, it will be comparable like a site of AP40 site we have elsewhere and it will replace Arvida.</p><p>And then I'm looking at the productivity. There is a big productivity uplift given by the technology also because we have 550 people, contractors plus RT employees on Arvida, and we'll have an additional 110 on AP60. So it's both targeting CO2 emission productivity, reducing the costs and improving productivity for sure. And then it will be comparable to the other smelters we have in the area in terms of costs.</p><p>PAUL YOUNG: Yeah, I mean that's sort of helpful. But with specifically with the investment decision, like, what did you sign off on that investment decision? So what did the economics look like? Was it -- were your goal seeking for a return, licence to operate? Like, what do the economics look like?</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: Maybe I'll take this one. So I think there's a couple of aspects. So directly to your question first, the investment in AP60 and our overall replacement programme on Arvida is value accretive, so it fits within the Rio Tinto allocation framework for capital. We are way above our cost of capital, so this is a positive. I mean, you can look at it the same way we look at our investment across.</p><p>So I think it's quite important. So that's probably the first element to your question. The second element to answer your question is also. So the way to think about it, you are - we were producing 170 kiloton at Arvida. We are -- with the AP60 expansion, we are replacing about 160 kiloton of AP60, and we are adding 30 kiloton of recycling capacity.</p><p>So you actually have a small growth play. And then on your baseline of AP60, you're just more productive and more competitive than the old smelter. And I think S\u00c3\u00a9bastien alluded to the fact that we believe that we have -- it's a technology where we can still drive amperage creep. And so we have margin to further improve this moving forward.</p><p>So if I summarise, the investment in AP60, yeah, there's a social licence aspect. There's a transition aspect. We had to close this asset. But the investment squarely fits into the capital allocation framework of Rio, was approved by the investment committee based on those elements of returns.</p><p>And then you add the component of small growth plus much more efficient technology and productivity, and you have a play that is a value play. So I think it's the same way when you think about -- when we talk about decarbonisation. We think about our social licence and what does it mean from a community standpoint. But we think about how does that improve the competitiveness of our business.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And last -- I mean, as of today, I mean probably 30% progress, we are in line with the CAPEX forecast. So there is no overspend on AP60. So the economic case stands. I mean, when you look at it, the economic case was approved on the basis of value creation instead of the basis of the CAPEX spend -- of the CAPEX we planned to spend and the current market assumptions.</p><p>And we can spend more time in tomorrow. And pointing to Greg our project leader for Rio Tinto Aluminium, we can give a bit more background on project execution tomorrow.</p><p>RICHARD HATCH, ANALYST, BERENBERG, GOOSLER &amp; CO.: Richard Hatch, Berenberg. A couple of questions. The first one just for Will. You've talked about increasing aluminium intensity. But I just wonder if you can talk about substitution, demand destruction and such. Like, if you do see prices increase, do you start to see users of aluminium begin to thrift or substitute with other forms of input commodities? Thanks. First one.</p><p>WILL MILLSTEED: Look, that's an interesting question, because normally we get the question the other way around. Like I get asked from a copper analyst, or I get worried about people substituting out of copper and into aluminium, because over the last few decades, we've actually seen about a 1% per annum taken off the copper growth rate, if you like, by substituting into aluminium. Now, that only adds about 0.2% tailwind to aluminium that substitution into.</p><p>Look, I probably have to take that question on notice as to substitution out of aluminium, because most of what we're hearing is actually about more substitution into, like the transmission and distribution lines in China, for example, there's more penetration of aluminium going on away from copper. And so there's a few things like that.</p><p>But no, look, I don't have too many concerns on the aluminium coming out. Perhaps we can grab you at lunch or in the break, and I'll grab my bigger brain on aluminium sitting over here at another table and we'll talk about it.</p><p>RICHARD HATCH: The copper question was the second one on my list, but I'll save that one for later. Just on Amrun, you talked about increasing production. I'm just trying to look at my numbers there. I think it was slated at running at 23 million tons but runs at like 36.</p><p>You know, if you're talking about taking Amrun up to 50, can you just talk about what that can take your bauxite numbers up to? And I guess there'll be a bit of maybe mine depletion to take off for that. And then what the cost of getting yourself up to that level would - could be? And I guess it would be a long-dated FID.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: So the balance is -- the balance on bauxite is as we -- as you know, our Gove mine is basically coming to end of life in a few years. So to replace this tonnage, we will need to extend Amrun, which is not yet approved, but we think there is a strong case.</p><p>If we expand Amrun, as we plan to do it, it will be with a view to maintain our total bauxite tonnage to close to where they are today. Maybe not exactly the full 56, but not too far from it. So that's the plan. And we think we can expand Amrun, again, not approved. We are working through the economic case, but we think there is a value creative case to expand Amrun to replace Gove and maintain the tonnage not too far from what they are today. I mean, I don't know if we disclose that yet. Turning to Tom. It is part of our CapEx plan, but not yet approved.</p><p>TOM GALLOP: No, we haven't put any numbers out on that yet. But that's obviously something at the right time we'll provide that detail to the market.</p><p>ALAN SPENCE, ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS EXANE: Alan Spence, BNP Paribas Exane. Just in terms of the split between value added products and the remelt, looking at the 2030, it looks like the kind of value addeded -- just looking at primaries, only a slight majority of the mixed, whereas actually it was pretty much balanced in '21 and '22. What are the limitations to not going further to increase in that mix even more?</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM: So the current mix globally prior to the Matalco joint venture was about 50-50. Okay? A little bit more weighted to value-added products in North America versus Asia Pacific. With Matalco, we're moving into kind of that 60% range of VAPs globally and a higher percentage in North America. So what was the next part of your question?</p><p>ALAN SPENCE: But just on the primary side, what are the limitations to not growing that primary value added product mix more?</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM: So right now, in everything that we've announced, we're fixed in terms of the amount of products that we're going to produce. And so then it's really with the exception of productivity improvements that you heard it, Arvida, et cetera. So really, it's then about shifting between remelt and value-added products.</p><p>And right now we have a bias for value added products because we are seeing, you know, greater price performance and interest in the market. And that's definitely where the short is right now and is capturing additional value for us.</p><p>ALAN SPENCE: I'm sorry, maybe speaking of circles, but the target for 2030 is just a kind of small majority being value added. Why not go more aggressive?</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM: I think that's a good question. Why not more?</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: I think if I can just compliment your -- if you look at the number this year and when we flex and the years were on the primary, we are slightly below the 40%. It's market driven. I think we -- I talk under the control of S\u00c3\u00a9bastien here. But our current primary casthouses are operating around 70% currently based on the -- on what we see on the billets.</p><p>So as those market dynamics improve, our first aspect is, yeah, we want to fully utilize 100% of these tools. So that will provide you, I will say, north of 50%, and then Matalco comes on top of that. So I think do we want to increase capacity at this moment? We don't know. What we for sure know is that we'd be able to capture the opportunity to fully utilize our network of primary casthouses. And then on top of that, add the optionality that Matalco is providing to us.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And I'm not sure I heard all of your question, but we don't rule out targeted, value created investment in some expansion of our portfolio for value added. For example, I mean, we announced yesterday in Saguenay that we are going on in our projects to add a billet production line in the Alma smelter, which you will see tomorrow. So there might be some targeted niche investments in value-added capacity to make the case and the mix better.</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS: Maybe I can provide a more technical answer to the question. Most of our casthouses are connected directly to our pot room. So there is constraint we need to manage. So having, let's say, 100% of value added production connected to our pot room may create some disturbance in the pot room, which is more than 80% of our EBITDA. So we're trying to keep optionality. But we need some sites being able to take the flex, so there is a limit to it. We're not saying there is not additional potential, but I don't think it's realistic to be 100 though.</p><p>KATE MCCUTCHEON, ANALYST, CITIGROUP, INC.: Kate McCutcheon, Citi. The capital outlook that you gave, you mentioned that some of your Canadian smelters were getting long in the tooth. You've announced the [165] in June I think at Grande Baie I think it was. Can we get a sense of what's upcoming? You've given that outlook. What's upcoming in terms of refurbishment for the smelters? And then just clarify the Canadian dams as well. Is Rio responsible for any of that upkeep there?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: So, I mean, it's hard to be specific to the level of what we disclosed. But when you Ulric says that we plan to have our CAPEX coming back to depreciation, this includes what we need to refurbish our smelters. And I would say our smelter operations are generally, I mean, well maintained. And there is not something like huge coming, as well as maintaining our hydro operation in Quebec.</p><p>And our hyro operation in Quebec, for example, we have one of our big powerhouses in Isle-Maligne, which is going to undergo a very significant overhaul programmes. So that's part of what we need to do. And when we say we'll get CAPEX to 100% of depreciation, that includes the sustenance that we think we need. And that includes as well, investing in our impeccable ESG framework on a number of fronts.</p><p>Then again, when I think about our hydro dams, looking at what we have here in Canada, out of all our seven dams, there are seven powerhouses. There is one in Quebec which needs a significant upgrade and the one in Kitimat will need continued refurbishment. The other one have been invested and are good to go for the next decade without anything major. S\u00c3\u00a9bastien, you would agree with that?</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS: Yeah, I totally agree. Isle-Maligne and Kemano in BC, this is the one going through a massive, let's say, refurbishment. The others, we have a regular programme on the standard on the civil works to take care of. But this is an important part of our, let's say, sustaining CAPEX. But it's well covered in our capital envelope.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And the other guidance I can give you, looking forward. And when you look at our industrial assets, probably the bulk of the CAPEX is going to be expanding some of our bauxite mines, reinvesting in some of our alumina processing facilities, including to decarbonise, versus a major overhaul of any smelter.</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS: I see the only two exceptions on which we have two big sustaining capital programme, this is the alumina conveyor, which is in execution in Kitimat, and the anode baking furnace in UGB. But besides these two one and the electrical dam, the rest, let's say it's regular CAPEX.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: It's more the upstream of the value chain than the smelters that needs investment.</p><p>KATE MCCUTCHEON: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up just on the Matalco acquisition. I think in 1Q you did about 140,000 tons on 100% basis, and you called out weak operating conditions. In last quarter, you mentioned weak operating conditions for the Matalco production, for the acquisition that you did. Are those weak market conditions persisting? Or is there anything you can say? I'm just trying to reconcile last quarter versus the outlook that you've presented today.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: I think on Matalco, I mean, we said we are all and particularly myself, who just joined at the time it was closed, absolutely convinced about the strategic logic. I think we are suffering from two things on Matalco today in terms of the quarterly performance.</p><p>One thing is a low market in terms of the extrusion market in the US, which is primarily driven by the state of the construction industry. So there are hopes that this will get better after the election and when the interest rates getting lower. But we are not waiting -- sitting and waiting for that. I think we are working on the cost of Matalco, on the fixed cost plant by plant, to get to a better structure.</p><p>The second thing that Matalco is suffering from is more expensive access to scrap. And here I think there is a game that we can play in the next few quarters, which is help them to get access to more pre-consumer and post-consumer scrapping.</p><p>We have access to a number of consumers down the value chain so we can help them unlock access to some of the pre-consumer scrap with technology -- and Nigel can say a word on that later on, we can allow them to process post-consumer scrap, which is a different level of purity.</p><p>So on one side, at some stage the market will get better, but we are working on the cost quarter after quarter to improve the performance and we start to see some benefits on it in the second half of the year, and then we have to help them get more options for scrap sourcing, which is more medium term, but something that we are convinced we can play a difference.</p><p>ANDREW BYRNE, ANALYST, WELLINGTON MANAGEMENT: Hi. Andrew Byrne, Wellington. Quick question. You've got a slide on page 31 showing Pac Al moving from the fourth quartile to about the middle of the cost curve. Sorry if I'm not being too sharp here, but exactly what is it that's driving that cost change in the base there?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: It is the blended cost. I mean, Australia is blessed with very competitive solar and wind resource. So what's driving that for Boyne in particular is the blended costs of our solar and wind and battery resource that will secure the PPA with the additional benefits of being able to play a bit of the energy trading game during the day, as Jonathon explained, and providing demand response service to the network, which gets to a net electricity cost, which is much better than we have today on our current supply contracts.</p><p>ANDREW BYRNE: Okay, that makes sense how it improves today. Last time I checked, though, China's pretty good at building aluminium smelters, renewables, and has a very strong power demand drive. So what changed? What -- why can't the second half of the cost curve that's predominantly China follow that route and then you have a flattening of the curve. (multiple speakers)</p><p>JONATHON MCCARTHY: It's the most important question for the future of the aluminium curve, which is where do you see evolution of people being able to access energy markets to do that. And so exactly the recipe that we're talking about to use at Boyne, can that be deployed elsewhere. And you need a few conditions. You need open market energy -- open energy markets where you can, as we described, procure low-cost renewables, but also sell back a bit during the day.</p><p>And so parts of the Chinese market don't create that dynamic, they end up being a price taker to energy. We can play on the other side. It's the same here, some of the regulated markets in North America, you have to be a price taker on the customer side. So the Australian energy market dynamics actually give us a bit of that opportunity. Now they can change over time.</p><p>But also if you look at where is the production located, and we'll show the chart that it's been moving, but it's been moving at a rate that we can see, that we can forecast. We have good connections into that industry and all of our analysis at the moment -- there's another slide in here I'll try and find you the number. But our analysis is telling us that we think that the aluminium curve will actually steepen over the transition before it gets back out to fully paid down energy grids and flattens off well into the future.</p><p>And then you get your competitive advantage for this business from different angles where we've been ahead of that curve. But we also have things like ELYSIS and access to different markets that not every smelter can access.</p><p>But when we talk about that transition period, I'm describing a 20-year period, not 5. And so I think as I open, it is the right question. But our best analysis tells us that the aluminium curve and what we're seeing globally is that energy prices are actually going up for industrial consumers. We think the period where they might come down on masses is well into the future.</p><p>ANDREW BYRNE: Can I just ask one question on tariffs? How do you guys think about the risk of tariffs in a Trump regime? Is that a zero-sum risk for you guys, or how are you thinking about the impact on your business?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: I think the reality is, as Amy explained earlier, there is very limited US based production aluminium capacity today and even less so, low carbon aluminium production capacity in the US, one.</p><p>Second, I think -- so if the tariff were to increase, then the alternatives for Canada supply would probably be supply coming from elsewhere and Canada into the US, which already undergoes today significant tariff and may undergo even more tariff in a more fragmented world. So until the best way I can say it, and Amy please tell me if you disagree. Until there is ample local supply in the US of low carbon aluminium, I don't think a tariff increase is a major short-term risk to our business.</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM: No. I think the US, which is the biggest consumer of aluminium in North America, is very dependent on the supply coming in from Canada. I don't think we want to mess with that. So as I said before in my presentation, there are only four remaining smelters in the United States, and there's very little announced or I don't believe there will be any primary production really being built. So I think that level of reliance on Canada is going to continue supporting the tariff scheme in place.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: (inaudible) to this part of the room now.</p><p>GRANT SPORRE, ANALYST, BLOOMBERG INTELLIGNECE: Grant Sporre, Bloomberg Intelligence. It's a follow up to Andrew's question. I'm just trying to think through the practicality of playing the power arbitrage game. Do you envisage somebody making the decision that, what, 4:00 in the afternoon and sort of saying, well, we're going to make more money producing aluminium or power and then turning down the amperage? And then the second part of the question is if you actually turn down the amperage in a pot, it does create sort of operational instability. So how are you going to factor that in?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: So just to be clear, first, we can't stop the smelter like that and reopen it as you well know. So there are some extreme situations and it's public in New Zealand, for example, a few months ago as part of the new contract for NZAS. We have a provision where the grid operator, the utility can ask us with notice to shut down some pots because there is very low water in the dam and we are doing it.</p><p>So in New Zealand, our contract provides with the right notice, the ability to bring down production to cover basically the lack of water in the dam, which creates a potential shortage and get paid for it. So that's the kind of the extreme. But -- and that takes a few weeks to come down and a few weeks to come up. So we cannot do it like that. Otherwise, we need to operate our pot on a continuous basis.</p><p>This being said, I mean, as Jonathon explained, we have the ability technically by managing what we call flex power, coming down 10% for one hour, 20 -- on amperage, 20% for two hours, maybe over time, 30% for three hours. So we can -- with R&amp;D and with deep knowledge on how we operate, we can get that. And then you get into something which is quite meaningful in terms of allowing the grid to manage the peaks.</p><p>And here also you get paid for it. So a big part of the R&amp;D that we are doing is flexible management for our operations to get compensated for that without affecting the stability of the pots, nor the aluminium production. And that's what I say.</p><p>Well, we have to realise. I mean, we -- my team will correct me, in New Zealand, I think our smelter is 30% or 40% of the electricity demand of the South Island. In eastern Australia, I think we are around 12% of the electricity demand for eastern Australia. So we are a big part of the energy system where we operate, and the ability to provide this service is going to be important. That's when I say we are in an aluminium game, we are in an energy game.</p><p>And it's also going to be when we have a fully repowered Boyne, how do we manage during the day, the daily arbitrage between the way we operate the smelter, the battery and the renewable source. And that's a source of upside. We need to get smarter and smarter on this. But we can't stop the smelter like that.</p><p>GRANT SPORRE: Okay. So just to follow up. So I mean, today, do you have the technical capability to do that, or is that still something that you need to develop?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: We are -- we have it and we are trying to test the limit of it. We can -- today, we can do -- I mean, Nigel, maybe we want to take it. We can do.</p><p>NIGEL STEWARD, CHIEF SCIENTIST, RIO TINTO PLC: We do have the technical capability to do it. For example, that modulation between day and night. We've done this before in Alcan, in our smelters in Brazil, where we had high power costs during the day and low power costs at night. So we used to cycle and it used to be plus or minus 5% to 7%. And so that standard practice.</p><p>We can shut down a smelter. And we do this in Quebec, like for example, our Alouette smelter. In our power contract, we can shut down for about two hours completely and then restart without a problem. So we offer those sorts of services during the winter here in Quebec.</p><p>And the other things that we do. If you're on a power grid, one of the most critical things is when the frequency of the grid starts to drop because of high demand on the grid. The grid needs a sudden injection of power, and that's absolutely critical. If the grid frequency drops, the whole grid collapses. And that's what a smelter can do.</p><p>We literally switch off the smelter for five seconds to inject the power. So there's those sorts of offerings in the power system as well. So -- but like J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me said, what we're trying to do is when I talked about that plus or minus 5% to 7%, the experiments that we're doing now in our research facilities in France is to push that even further, more extreme.</p><p>JONATHON MCCARTHY: Hi, Grant. Perhaps, if I can just add, because your point is well made around in the short term, these are -- we're talking numbers 5%, 7% reaching to 10s, 20s. The core of what we're doing right now in Queensland is a slightly longer energy position.</p><p>So if you think about the megawatts, we're taking up 1.1 of solar, 1.1 gigawatt of wind. This is a smelter that when we get it back to full pot line capacity, is 960-megawatt nameplate. So if the wind is blowing perfectly in that spot and the sun is shining, we'll have double the amount of megawatts at that moment. And as everyone in the room knows, it's variable throughout the forecast.</p><p>But by having that portfolio together with the batteries we're looking to contract, we have a slightly different edge to everyone else in the power market, because in the middle of the day, all you can do if you're an energy operator is charge your batteries or sell at a low cost, and we can turn it into a product that holds its value, sits on a stockpile, and we get it out to our customers.</p><p>So by having a slightly longer energy position than we have had before, we now have that ability to properly arbitrage within our energy portfolio back to the grid, to the smelter or into the batteries and all of our back test, and fore tests on that -- in that market tells us that we can make some margin there, and it changes this.</p><p>When you add on that technical capability, you really supercharge that capability. But for right now, it's using our endowed asset base, which is an ability to take cheap energy into a stored product that no one else in that market has. And the final point I'll make for you is what do we really want? And as J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me and I have described today, we are playing somewhat an energy game. That's always been the case in aluminium. We're just harnessing that in the future.</p><p>We also have an extremely strong ability to get these assets into the grid at a cheap cost. So a PPA backed by Rio Tinto for 20 years can attract significantly strong finance. And we're such an important part of the grid, we can help to get that placed into the right part of the queue to get built into the right part of the transmission network to reach us and into the right part of our business and the region.</p><p>You add those factors together, we're bringing online wind and solar that has structural advantages in where it's positioned, how it was financed. And so you're hitting those electrons into the grid at a cheap cost to our benefit.</p><p>So you're starting off at a nice advantage. You're a little bit long so that you can play that. And then you put technical capability on top in the next decade. Those steps actually mean that we're playing energy quite differently to a price taker that we've been for 20 years in that market.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And it's not only an Australia and New Zealand topic. I mean, here in Quebec, as I said, I mean, we are self-sufficient for 90% of our needs, which means at times we pull power from Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec. At other times when there is a peak, Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec asks us to help and we modulate our production to help Hydro-Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec. So it's a reality for the smelters everywhere we operate.</p><p>SEBASTIEN ROSS: And what's interesting in Quebec, we can do it with the smelters, but with the power dams also. So we're doing both.</p><p>GRANT SPORRE: No, I think I didn't quite appreciate if you -- to play the game, you need to be probably slightly long.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: And if you go to the end and then at the end when you have solar, wind and batteries, you need to have an ultimate resource in terms of firming. When you have no wind, no solar and your battery is empty, you still need to run the smelter. So you need a backup. And the cost of the backup is the last piece of the economic equation.</p><p>AUSTIN YUN, ANALYST, MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED: Austin Yun, Macquarie. Just in the presentation, you mentioned that you want to see more growth coming out of North America. And I can see that to create a successful recycling business is one of your key priorities. Just wondering, what's the ideal split between your primary and recycled product offering? Are you there yet?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: So today we have 3.3 million tons of production and capacity of primary. We have 900,000 tons of capacity in Matalco. I mean, I wish we'd probably be a little more balanced with more secondary over time just because secondary growing more. I think one, everywhere we have primary, we should have a secondary business.</p><p>So for example, in Australia, we are looking at options. The constraint in Australia is most of the scrap gets exported to China. So there is an overriding issue around developing secondary in many places, which is at some stage we need to have less scrap going to China and more scrap processed locally. But if you ask me, I probably wish it would be two thirds, one third.</p><p>AUSTIN YUN: Just quick follow up. Would that come from the current joint venture or would you expand to outside of the JV?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: In North America, it will come through the current joint venture because first it's the legal agreement we have. And second, it does make sense. And one of the beauty of being in secondary is it's like -- I mean, you have this map of a casthouse and then you can try to figure out particularly when the market is going to get better, where do I have access to a pile of scrap, either because of our Matalco partner or because of our customers? Where do we have customers for secondary aluminium? So where do I need to build the next casthouse?</p><p>One of the beauties with secondary is when you invest in primary, you start discussing a few billion investment. When you invest in secondary, it's much smaller investment and you can develop and how do we say in english, try to fill them up with much smaller investments where it makes sense. So, part of the development for Matalco going forward, when markets are better, is how can we expand our network of secondary casthouses in the US where it makes sense and it's cheaper, lower capital.</p><p>GLYN LAWCOCK, ANALYST, BARRENJOEY PTY LTD.: Glyn Lawcock, Barrenjoey. You've talked about the cap in China, but they're investing now heavily in Indonesia, Guinea. CBAM may not apply to those countries. They may not want to play. If that's the case, how does that change your view of the cost curve? You talked about a step up in the cost curve. But if we continue to see investment elsewhere, how does that change?</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: I mean, actually, there was a slide that Jonathon showed, we're showing the cost curve and also the CO2 curve, because now we tend to look at the two in parallel. Today, we see investment in aluminium smelting, as Amy said, I mean primarily high carbon, primarily India and in Indonesia. We think most of this will go and capture the growth in what we call the Global South, because that's where it's competitive rather than being competing with us in our core North America, Japanese, Korean markets.</p><p>So we kind of see a bit. We don't see it being heavily competitive in our most established market by the combination of trade barriers into the US and high carbon content.</p><p>ULRIC ADOM: We talk about the cap in China at 45 million tonnes. We actually believe that the demand within China will continue and will be above this. So when you think about Indonesia and what they are doing for Indonesia and the capacity here, we think about that as a principal feed into the need of China from a primary standpoint, notably because of the cap. So that's some of the market dynamics also that are at play here.</p><p>JEROME PECRESSE: In summary, we see China demand being covered by China production and probably some Russian imports into China more and more. And we see most of the capacity in India, Indonesia going into global -- into the global south. Amy?</p><p>AMY ABRAHAM: China's going to be a net importer, right? So they're still growing. They want to support their semi exports around the world. And with the 45 million tonne cap, they're now starting to add recycling capacity, right? So the 45 million cap continues to supply their semi fabrication needs. But they're going to need more primary. So they're starting to set up integrated supply chains that you just referenced. So they're going to continue to be a net importer for primary.</p><p>They typically want to take primary products and turn them into semi-fabricated products. The government has put again a tax on exports really influencing them, similar to what Indonesia has done to focus on improving the quality and the value of the products before they're exported. So they've got like a 12% to 13% export cap and don't think that's going to be removed either.</p><p>So again, all markets are short. Outside of China, there's new capacity going into India. It's Indonesia. Those markets are long. And so they're going to find additional homes. They're going to find homes typically in Europe and in the southeast of Asia.</p><p>JONATHON MCCARTHY: Glyn, I might just add one thought. You made a good point about CBAM's ability to get across all of these markets. But one thing that's very new, and we're watching closely, and some of you might be also, is the expansion of the emissions trading scheme in China.</p><p>And so China's expanding scope, and the way they're ratcheting up ETS over the coming years for industry is worth watching and plays into this narrative because it puts them inside of the -- you know, China's production in this market goes inside of the tent of where does carbon matter as opposed to sitting on the outside as you describe. So it's certainly happening now as we're all working to understand where it will land.</p><p>GLYN LAWCOCK: Thanks. And just a follow up. Just you talked -- I know we're talking about aluminium, but there was a slide you talked about premiums for iron ore for high grade. With Simandou coming on 120 million tons of 67%, how does that play out into your thesis of better premiums for high grade?</p><p>WILL MILLSTEED: Look, I think as I described, I think there's two things that are going to happen in the iron ore market over the next 20 years. Existentially, the iron ore market can't exist without a big breakthrough on an electric melter, and that will inevitably happen. It's not a question of if it will, it's when.</p><p>But in the meantime, as I mentioned, there's only one proven route really DRI EAF for decarbonisation of the existing steelmaking that we do, and that's probably going to dominate for the next ten years. I think there's easily enough high grade demand, if you like, to soak up Simandou, to soak up the existing high grade ores that are out there in the market, as well as IOC.</p><p>Look that -- yeah, that's it. I think the only thing that sort of dents that would change that outlook, Glyn, is if you believe that carbon pricing was going to come on somehow slower than we do, or some sort of structural change in profitability of steel mills, more profitability equals higher grade premiums. No profits equals lower grade -- sorry, lower high grade premiums.</p><p>Everyone. Sorry. If you didn't get a question, Matt, sorry. We're at time. Thanks for the great questions. I assure you'll have the opportunity to fill in any gaps over lunch now for the next hour, and over the next few days with the team.</p><p>So if we can just resume at around quarter past one, please, back in your seats and then we'll move to the second half of the program. The next presentation will be Sophie Bergeron talking about our iron and titanium business to set off the second half of the day.</p><p>SOPHIE BERGERON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, IRON &amp; TITANIUM AND DIAMONDS: Thank you. So welcome back. I have a very difficult job of keeping people awake after lunch. I'll do my best. I'm Sophie Bergeron. I'm the Managing Director of iron and titanium business, as well as diamonds.</p><p>A little bit about me. I'm a mining engineer by training. First 10-ish years of my career in base metal. After another ten-ish years in gold industry. And I joined Rio Tinto in 2020. So I've been with Rio for now, four years. So really happy to be here.</p><p>I started actually with iron and titanium business in 2022, at the end of 2022. So it's been two years that I'm working with that business. And I can tell you it's very fascinating business. I'm still learning, and I think I'm still having a couple of years to fully learn the whole extent of the complexity of this business, but I hope I can really transfer my excitement around that fascinating business unit.</p><p>So we'll start with who we are. So first of all, a little bit of history. So iron and titanium started here in Quebec in 1956. So the whole business started based on innovation. It was Hatch, a company -- the engineering company Hatch, who developed a novel technology to process and smelt the ore from a world class deposit that we have here in Quebec, in the northern Quebec, in Havre-Saint-Pierre. So everything started there.</p><p>Today, we still have the IP on that technology, especially the smelting technology. And it is also the technology we're using, the same technology we're using everywhere where we operate across the world. So we're a global leader in TiO2 market. We currently have 14% of the market shares. As I said, we started with innovation. And innovation is part of our DNA.</p><p>And I'll speak to that along the presentation because you'll see we're also operating decarbonisation of our assets. We're the only one in the TiO2 industry to decarbonise as we speak. And we use our innovation DNA to do that. And we'll talk a little bit more, and Nigel will also present a bit on what we do.</p><p>Best operator. S\u00c3\u00a9bastien did talk about best operator. We also started our journey of best operator in 2022. So we're deeply committed to best operator, and we're starting to see very interesting results. But over the results for some of you who will be visiting Sorel on Friday, you'll see that not only you'll see the results of best operator in our operations, but you will feel it. It's a culture. Best operator, it means that we're always seeking for conscious improvement, for better results. And I can tell you, you will witness it.</p><p>What do we do? We produce titanium dioxide feedstock. So titanium dioxide is extracted mainly from ilmenite, and ilmenite can be mined from hard rock or from mineral sands. Ilmenite always contains iron, so it contains irons in the range of 25% to 40%. So by extracting titanium and processing and smelting titanium dioxide, we are also producing iron ore.</p><p>And we produce in Canada not only iron ore, but we produce steel as well as metallic powders. From the minerals sands, we also have some co-products such as zircon, rutiles and monazites, which is a composite of rare earths. And we also sells a little bit of ilmenite directly on the market.</p><p>Titanium dioxide can occur in two forms. So from ilmenite you extract, you upgrade, or you can directly process ilmenite and produce pigment directly from ilmenite. Or you upgrade the titanium into a slag, a titanium dioxide slag that is used for pigment production. As mentioned by Will this morning, there's two routes. So there's the sulphate routes and the chloride route. So we produce mainly in Sorel and in South Africa what we call the titanium dioxide slag. And I'll show a little bit more of where we operate.</p><p>The market is very niche market. So we're talking about the titanium dioxide only slag. It's a 7.4 billion market. So very niche. It's not a commodity and it's mainly business to business type of market. So we have to maintain strong relationship with our customers. And we have long lasting customers from the beginning of our history. So our customers are mainly pigment producers and titanium sponge producers, as well as welding supplies.</p><p>And their customers or the customers of our customers are the paint producers, plastic producers, coating, name it, everything that has a colour, everything that needs opacity. So that's what we -- that's what our market is. The titanium sponge market is very different one. Titanium sponge for titanium metal that goes in aerospace as well as medical and also other type of technology. So that market is also very niche in our niche market. And they do need high quality, high grade products most of the time.</p><p>We are producing -- RTIT, we're producing high quality, high grade products and one of our best products is produced here in Sorel. It's called UGS. We call it upgraded slag, and you will be seeing the UGS plant on Friday. It's very chemical type of plant, very difficult one to operate. But we're the only one being able to produce that type of upgraded slag.</p><p>So we'll explain that the market also very based on the GDP, as the GDP grow. It's linked to real estate market mainly. And that is for mostly pigment market. And the titanium metal market is most -- is growing actually a little bit faster than GDP as we're seeing a lot of demand on the aerospace and defence. So our main customers in titanium sponge are all looking for growth as we speak.</p><p>So where we operate? So our market is global, that's the strength of RTIT. We operate in two main locations. One in Canada, our Sorel metallurgical plant, and one in South Africa, the South African asset has been constructed in 1976 and is a little bit more modern. However, it uses the same exact technology that we're using in Sorel, the one that we have an IP and we have a technical advantage on.</p><p>So Canada, we're using mostly the ilmenite from our asset in Quebec, in Havre-Saint-Pierre; and in South Africa, we're operating mineral sands. So we're dredging the sands to feed our South African asset. We also have a mine in Madagascar called QMM. And the mine in Madagascar is a mineral sand. And it's also feeding our Canadian asset.</p><p>So we produce a mix of different products from each location. We produce sulphate and chloride slag from both locations where we operate. So we have that capacity and that flexibility like aluminium to play with the portfolio and looking at what's the best product, what's the best location from to serve our different customers on the market as we have customers all around the world.</p><p>So our strategy. Oops, too fast. Okay. Our Strategy. So we've been going through a couple of challenging years, I would say, in the last couple of years. And one thing that we absolutely needed to do is to stabilise our operations. So our strategy has been built, first off, on maintaining our global leadership position, but also strengthening that global leadership position.</p><p>When I say maintaining, we are the provider -- TiO2 feedstock provider for most western customers. So our western customers are not integrated. Some slag producers are fully integrated from the mine to the pigment. But our customers in the western market, the pigment producers that are not integrated, we are their feedstock mostly. So when I say maintaining, it means maintaining that strong market that we are feeding and also strengthening our market globally. So that's what we want to achieve.</p><p>And first off, as I said, it's all about best operator. There's no way you can grow if you don't have a stable operation. And stable operation means that you can start seeing very boring results month after month after month with growth, with continuous improvement into it. So that's what we're looking for. And Sorel that you'll be visiting has achieved that as we speak.</p><p>I did talk about our leadership in technology. It's a huge advantage of our business, where we known around the world in the TiO2 market for our technological advantage. We have a technology centre in Critical Minerals Centre in Sorel, next to our operations, with a team that has been in that business for a long time. I won't say that they were there at the beginning, but they've been there for a long time and they're definitely renowned on the market.</p><p>When we deploy our technical teams in the field to our customers, they really appreciate that and they add value to our customers. So that's something that we want to keep and we nurture very much. Our commercial excellence and strong partnership. It's also something that defines RTIT. As I said, we have long-standing relationship with our customers.</p><p>There's market that we haven't been supplying a lot in the past for many reasons, sometimes because we didn't have the capacity, but we always had the relationship and we still have those relationship.</p><p>So strong relationship for us, that's the key, not only for our growth, because we have that capacity to grow. We have our assets, have that capacity to grow and produce more with the installed furnaces. And we are in a position now to do that.</p><p>So through our relationship, we can get some emerging market that are mainly in Asia. So you can imagine India is a growing market as well as we're looking for growth in China. Strategic resource. Obviously, to produce the slag that we provide to the market, we need the resource. We need the deposits. In Canada, we're very privileged. We have a world class asset of 75 years. However, that's not necessarily the case for our African assets.</p><p>We still have a strong 15 years of life in Africa for mineral sands, but we need to entertain a pipeline to make sure that we will have a longer life and we can guarantee the supply to our customers. And obviously I'll talk about partnership, but that's key. We're the only operators in Africa in all Rio Tinto, and we also have an operating -- small operating asset in China.</p><p>So Africa, we operate in non-OECD countries and our licence to operate for us. It's also key to keep our stability in operations. So I talked about China. So I said at some point we didn't have the capacity to grow in China. And as Will explained, China market really shifted the pigment production in the last five years. Unfortunately, when that it started -- when that shift started, we weren't at the point that we were able to capture some of the market share.</p><p>However, today we are. And we started that in 2022 when we started with our best operator journey. So you can see that since 2022, we've been able to grow with that same trend of the market when the market started to shift.</p><p>So we've talked about best operator. I said we are very committed. We're not only committed, it's a culture for us. Best operator it's a way of doing things. And we do that also through our innovations. So what you see there and I was looking at people, computing stuff in the room, so I made a little bit of maths for you already.</p><p>So we had -- actually if you look at the years 2022, 2023, we've been operating with about between 11 to 12 furnaces globally. So I just add like the furnaces that we have between Sorel. We have the capacity of nine furnaces in Sorel and four in South Africa at RBM. So we used to operate with 11 to 12 furnaces.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2023, we had some process safety incidents and we've been losing two furnaces in 2023. And we've been rebuilding one now and we will be rebuilding another one next year. But today, in 2024, we are operating with nine furnaces globally. However, the nine furnaces are producing at a rate per furnace that is the best that we've seen in the last ten years.</p><p>So we're very proud of that, very proud of the work that we've done, not only in Canada but also in South Africa, to make sure that we were getting the best operating rate from each asset that we have.</p><p>We've also done that with our dredges. So our dredges are huge equipment. They need to operate at optimal capacity. So recovery as well is very important with our wet plants. And we can say that we've also reached a point that our dredges are operating at a rate that we haven't seen for the last seven years. So we've seen lots of major improvements in our business, which position, as I said, very well for growth.</p><p>And we've learned from our process safety incidents. You will see for -- during the visit that since we've had not only process safety incidents in 2023, but we have had process safety incidents before. So we've taken the measures, and we've invested in systems, engineered systems to make sure that we were protecting not only our people, but also our assets. So you will see that when you will be visiting.</p><p>So I did talk about resource. So we're very lucky as we have a long life asset here in Quebec. And although Saint-Pierre is a very unique ilmenite ore body, so we can enjoy a 75 years life still. And if you think about it, we've started 75 years ago. So it means that asset is more than 100 years asset production. We are also looking for a pipeline of different projects that we are entertaining for our Africa operations. And you can see that there's a couple of options that we entertain in Mozambique, Malawi, as well as also in South Africa.</p><p>You've probably heard, if you know a little bit about our business, about Zulti South. Zulti South is definitely our top project in the list. It's the RBM next deposit to be mined. We currently mine Zulti North at RBM and Zulti South is the next deposit.</p><p>Zulti South was supposed to start a little bit earlier. But as we speak, for some context and security reasons, we've delayed Zulti South. As we speak, we are refreshing the feasibility study on Zulti South as we see the context and the environment being very stable and a good experience for us so far in terms of government support as well as security situation in the country.</p><p>Decarb. Not only I'll talk about it a little bit, and Nigel will also build on the BlueSmelting technology, which is another proprietary technology that has been developed in Sorel. But you will see it on Friday and another highlight of the visit, no doubt. We have mainly a carbon footprint, which is partly the electricity that we consume in South Africa that is fossil fuel based in South Africa. So that's the big portion that you see of our carbon footprint that is linked to energy.</p><p>And the other part is what we call the reductants. And the reductants are what we're using in our smelter to reduce, to remove the oxygen from the TiO2. And titanium loves oxygen, so it's very difficult to remove oxygen from TiO2. So we used electrodes and anthracites, which is the other big chunk of our emission or carbon emission. So what we've done?</p><p>We all know that the decarbonization won't happen with one solution. It's a mix of solution. So we've started by securing PPAs in South Africa. So we have over 500 megawatts secured in South Africa, and we will be getting the first electrons of those PPAs next year in 2025 and following years.</p><p>BlueSmelting, novel technology. Nigel will talk about that. I'll leave it with Nigel. And we have another solution that we've just inaugurated, which is called a new company. \u00c3\u2030volys. What's \u00c3\u2030volys? It's a bio-carbon company. So starting next year, we've done a joint venture with a company called Aymium. Aymium is already working with Nippon Steel in the USA.</p><p>It's a US company based. And we've started the JV with them. We will be producing from repurposing a old pulp and paper plant here in Quebec, will be producing bio-carbon starting next year. So we are planning for a 50,000 tonnes of bio-carbon first phase and following by an increase for the second phase.</p><p>So partnership, very important value as well at Rio Tinto. We always look for win-win partnership. It's always about what makes sense for us and the partner. As an example, we've secured our QMM fiscal agreement for another 25 years in Madagascar. So as you all know, Madagascar, a very poor country, we made sure that the benefits from our operation in Madagascar will be sustained through time and along that 25 years. So that's what we called a very good win-win agreement.</p><p>We worked since we are in Havre-Saint-Pierre with the community called Ekuanitshit, and we have a very good collaboration with Ekuanitshit and looking at the environment together to make sure that our impact are minimised as much as possible.</p><p>So in summary, here is a couple of metrics. I mentioned that our strategy is to maintain and maintaining is definitely not enough. We need to grow. So maintain and strengthen. What the strengthened part will give us, will give us that growth, that growth that we need to make sure that the volume -- we're a volume business, so we need the volume to make sure that numbers are making sense for the business.</p><p>So again, the ROCE, very conscious that there's room for improvement there. And we have a plan. And the plan is based on our strategy. It's based on what we are looking for that growth. And as I said first off, positioning ourselves for that growth was the first step. And we are ready for that specific opportunity when the market is showing because we are like in a slightly up market, I would say, but not yet at the point that we've seen in the past, it's coming, and we're there.</p><p>So production, how we get there? Production increase. We definitely have the capacity. We can produce 50% more of what we're producing right now with the installed capacity. And when we produce more, it means also that we extract the full potential of our deposits. So I mentioned all the co-product that we have with the iron, which also are providing the value out of the production. So they are definitely really helping our business case.</p><p>Cost management, volume comes also with the cost. But best operator is also the way we've been addressing our cost structure. And best operator, it's in everything we do and it's in the cost leadership as well. So that's a very important point for us.</p><p>We have a very complex business and we're working also on simplifying the business to make sure that our cost structure is making more sense. So that's how we're planning to address the different pillars to get to a better return for the business. So we're quite confident that we can achieve the double digit and plus with our titanium dioxide business.</p><p>So on that, I didn't check my time. But I think I'm not too bad. It's 30 minutes to explain a very complex business. I just hope that you will join for the visit in Sorel. And I can tell you, witnessing the best operator culture that we've implemented there, as well as the innovation that we have, and we will be presenting much more during the visit, like the scandium production, the titanium metal powder production that we're looking to develop, which will be very interesting. So thank you very much and looking forward to see you again on Friday. Thanks.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt; MIKE MCCANN: Good afternoon, everyone. Pleasure to meet a number of you during some of the breaks in the beginning of the morning. My name is Mike McCann. I'm the President and CEO of IOC. And I've been with Rio Tinto now, as of last week three years. My time flies, doesn't it? I've been in the mining industry for 34 years. I know I look young for my age, but 34 years in the mining industry. I started off in 1990 with Inco. A few folks might remember that name around the room, taken over by Vale, and I've been in the base metals business for all that period of time. But really excited to be here to talk to you today a little bit about IOC and how we fit into the portfolio, and also hopefully able to answer some of your questions. I'm going to start off with somewhat of a bit of a bold statement. There is actually significant value to be unlocked from our IOC assets by focusing on best operator. And you've heard this word best operator around. But truly there's a significant unlock of value with IOC. I'm going to weave this into my presentation today as we speak. But when you start looking at some of the pieces and how we fit in, we are part of the global iron ore portfolio within Rio Tinto. However, we're a little bit different. We do have high grade iron content in our ores as well as very, very low impurities. And just recently, not just in Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, but just recently, the federal government in Canada has listed high grade iron ore as a critical mineral. You'll notice as we go through the slides that IOC also has a very long resource base. We have many years of operating there, and we're in tier one jurisdiction, a safe, stable jurisdiction to operate in. And we do have pathways. Jonathon's alluded to some of them in terms of decarbonising our operations, specifically around the Scope 1 and Scope 2. But what really, really excites me is the opportunity where we can play within the Scope 3 framework and carbon reductions within the steel industry. That's where really the money shot is, I think. And we do have a clear pathway improving our operational stability while not quite there yet, and delivering our nameplate capacity of 23 million tonnes. On this next slide, you can see as the highlights from the previous one that we are a complement to the Rio Tinto portfolio when we're looking at iron ore. On the left-hand side of the screen, you can see the dots showing the size of the operation. But when you look at IOC, when I said we have great resource base, we have 80-plus years in our resource base. So we're really, really well positioned there for a long-term viable operation. When you look at our products, we make two types of products. One is called CFS, concentrate for sale or concentrate for centre. It has high iron content, very low impurities. Our customers seek it out. And our main markets are in Europe and Asia Pacific. Our second product we make are pellets and we make two types. We make a blast furnace pellet and a direct reduction pellet. Our direct reduction pellets mostly go into Middle East, North Africa as well as the Americas. And the blast furnace pellets are focused in Europe and Japan. We do have a diversified customer base, and you can see on the left-hand side around our product mix. We approximately make 50% of our product into pellets and the other 50% into our concentrate. When you break down that pellets a little bit more, it's about 60% blast furnace and about 40% into DR. That has shifted, and next year we're going to be closer to a 50-50 mix. In terms of the sales regions that we're in, 42% of our products go into Europe, primarily in the concentrate and the blast furnace components of our product, that, however, based on a lot of our visits and conversations with our customers, we're doing that transition to DR. 14% goes into the Americas, that's wholly DR product. 6%, which is quite interesting - I was just in North Africa with our team earlier this year, is into Middle East and Northern Africa as a DR product, but we're really seeing that expanding in the demand specifically around 2027 to 2030, we see that demand going up. 20% into Japan, Korea and Taiwan, mostly in the form of blast furnace and concentrate. And last but not least, we have concentrate going into China, specifically in our port side blending facilities. Regard of our operations and what it looks like up in the top right-hand corner, we are a joint venture. We're made up from 59% of Rio Tinto, 26% of Mitsubishi, and we have 15% of LIORC. We do have a complex value chain. We have five open pits in Labrador City and Newfoundland and Labrador, also two processing facilities there, one a concentrator and one a pelletizing plant. Our products from Labrador cities is linked down to Sept Iles through a 418-kilometre rail line, through what I would say is some of the most rugged areas within Canada. Not only is that rail line there for moving our product, we provide third party service to other producers within the trough as well as the community of Schefferville. Our strategy. What you can see here is our strategy actually aligns with Rio Tinto's four objectives. Our first pillar is stabilising our operation and making sure we safely meet our commitments to the organisation and to our shareholders. Second one is operate at our design capacity, which is our 23 million tonnes. Those two pillars are truly underpinned by the best operator approach. The next two pillars being a disciplined growth of the business as well as its decarbonisation, are underpinned by our projects and our studies that are going on now. Speaking about operational stability. We've had our fair challenges along this journey. Some have been external to us, but were really out of our control. Quite a few are internal that are well within our control. The external ones, if you look at 2023, we've had a forest fire along our rail line. It was consumed by about 40 kilometres along our rail line, and it knocked us down for a month, so we couldn't rail any product for a month. Just recently in 2024, in June, we were out for two days because Churchill Falls was evacuated. And then when the power tripped, there was no one on site to actually trip it back on. So we were out of power for two days. And of course my safety share this morning, we were evacuated for two weeks and we had a two week shortfall of operations there. Some of the external things that are providing pressure on us. Some of the internal ones that are in our control. We do have an aged infrastructure, but we can manage that. We have increased strip ratio because of the age of our mines. And as well from a best operator approach, we're starting from a low maturity level. We'll speak a little bit more later on about that around our processes and systems and our standards. And I want to give you an example around that from my days at Inco Vale. And we had one asset. Just say it was a copper refinery that kind of lost its way, probably lost its way for 15 years or 20 years, and went off from the standard policies, procedures of the parent organisation. And I was involved with the turnaround of that operation. And we were starting off in $0.18 a pound for copper. Our competitors were at $0.022. We had to get it down. These things take time. You have to put the basics back in place. And this took about four or five years for us to get it turned around and be competitive, put the standards in place and ensure we're following all the policies and procedures of the organisation. But all is not lost. There are some achievements in here. In 2023, we have in place a new five-year agreement with the steelworkers union. But we took a different approach. Everybody here probably understands with the negotiations. You have a power based approach where someone wins, someone you kind of loses. What we went in for the first time in the history of IOC is an interest based negotiations approach, which truly is a win-win. And through that approach, we've succeeded in ratifying a five-year agreement. In 2022, we've had the best safety performance in the history of IOC. In 2023, we've had the highest best rail haulage performance in the history of IOC. And just recently, in 2024, as we've been putting SPS into the mine, we've had our best total material moved in the history of IOC. So we do have some wonderful spots and achievements. A clear pathway has been identified to best operator. And you can see here getting from 17.7 to 23 million tonnes. But I guess, my Intel says there's a few analysts here that have been tracking Rio Tinto for a number of years. And if I was in your shoes, I'd be asking myself, I've heard this story before. It's been no fundamental change. You've never hit 23 million. And I bet you if you dig back in your thinking, I probably heard that in around 2017. We're going to hit 23 million. We got a plan. And if I was in your shoes, I'd be saying, what's different now? What's fundamentally different? Well, I can share with you, about three years ago, last week, I was hired by Rio Tinto and given a mandate to integrate IOC into Rio Tinto. It's been in, it's been out. IOC is a core asset to Rio Tinto. It is part of the energy transition. And we see it as a fundamental asset to support that. I've been asked to align our processes, our policies, our procedures, instil stability in the business, put in place an accountability based organisation and drive IOC to reach its full potential of 23 million tons. And that's why I've been hired. In the past, IOC has had its own systems, standards and processes. Some were good, some weren't as good. And we did not fully leverage the capabilities and expertise of Rio Tinto. So I'd like to share where are we at today? I've been with Rio Tinto three years. Got your feet wet for the first year. What have we really achieved and looked at over the last two years? First of all, when we talk about transition, at IOC right now, we're moving from our legacy SAP system. Who's here has gone through an SAP or knows of a company has gone through an SAP transition? A few. They're painful. Monday we go live on the Rio Tinto SAP system, 18 months of hard work, understanding, putting operational readiness in place. And we're going live on October 01, being I think it's Monday. We are adopting not some, but all of Rio Tinto's standards, and we're executing the Rio Tinto global initiatives: to be a best operator, SPS, asset management uplift on the safety maturity model. So that being said, and I'll reiterate, across these standards and processes, we started at a very low maturity level within IOC and our journey is a little bit longer than maybe some of the rest of the Rio Tinto assets. We do have a complex value chain. However, we do have a robust plan and a commitment to achieve the objective of 23 million tonnes. So back to this slide. As I mentioned, we have mapped out a detailed plan. We know what we need to do to achieve the 23 million. It is truly underpinned by best operator across the entire value chain, with SPS and asset management being the major building blocks. Let me provide you a few examples. We started our SPS journey approximately two years ago. Our pilot was our concentrator. That was the bottleneck. That was where we tried it all out. We had some steps forwards, a couple steps back backwards, but we had some step forwards. And after about 18 months, we got to a point that we had our run rates that might last a couple of weeks, well above 23 million tonnes a year. You have to produce about 62,000 tonnes of concentrate per day to meet your 23 million tonne objective. We were peaking at 90. We had weeks going at 75. We know the concentrator, when you take care of the asset and you put the right processes and you drive towards best operator can perform. During that time, I spent a lot of time going down talking to the supervisors, the superintendents, the shift crew lineups. People were really excited about being on a winning team. You could see a palpable shift in the culture in the view of the employees, and it was there to be seen. That being said, it wasn't sustainable. And why? Our bottleneck quickly shifted to upstream, into the mine and downstream into the rail, because we only put SPS in one place and testing it out. We are now fully focusing SPS across the value chain. We've been working on the mine probably for the last four months, and that's where we've got that result of our highest ever TMM in August. And we've seen significant improvement in the rail. We've actually improved the rail capacity since from 2022 to where we are now by about 5 million tonnes. So we are deploying SPS now right across the value chain, but it's just not the value chain where you actually have to be worried about. It's these transfer points, be it from the mine to the concentrated load out these points where you can drop, and you have to make sure that you're working right across all aspects is quite important. The second example would be around asset management. We went and looked into a maturity model around our asset management practices within IOC, from zero being very weak, four being, call it, best in class. And we did it and looked first of all at our concentrator and our pelletizing plant. We came in with 1.2 marginal. This is about 18 months ago. Huge amount of effort going in. We're now out of 2.4 out of 4. We still have a ways to go, but we're driving the best operator through these processes. We're changing the culture at IOC. We're committed. We're our core asset. We're leveraging Rio Tinto. So it's not in my mind around if we hit 23 million, it's when we hit 23 million. And when we do hit 23 million what does it mean? You know, I'm an operator. I'm not a financial guy. So I'll put it in financial terms. It's about a 5% increase in EBITDA margin. But my mind the greatest value, you see a 20% decrease in our unit costs. We have about 65% fixed costs. And our biggest lever is getting production out. Of course, operating just part of the puzzle. A big piece is also ensuring we're engaging and working closely with our stakeholders. And of course, one of them is the government. We do have strong relationships with our governments, with the Quebec government, with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. Just recently, about two years ago, we opened an office in Saint John's. We haven't had an office in Saint John's for decades, and it was imperative for us to build and reach out and create that relationship back into the government and the individuals within Newfoundland and Labrador. At that opening, we had the premier. We probably had a half a dozen ministers, a number of local business dignitaries, and all very supportive of the efforts that IOC and the - and part of the fabric that we are in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2023, we saw the Newfoundland and Labrador government, as well as the Quebec government, announced that high grade iron ore is on their critical minerals list. Shortly after that, we saw the federal government make that commitment as well. In regards to the communities, we talk about Newfoundland and Labrador. We are the second largest private employer within the province. And to give you an idea of what we contribute, we're approximately 2% of the GDP of the province coming from one operation within Labrador. And of course, we're an anchor in the north shore of Quebec in terms of community at Sept Iles. Last but not least for sure, is our relationships with our indigenous partners. You can see on the map to the right where Labrador City is sitting, we intersect five different traditional territory claims with our indigenous partners, and we take those relationships very seriously. Within Sept Iles, we're within one. I put in place about two years ago a quarterly, what I call, chief to chief meetings, That takes up almost two to three weeks of my time a year, sitting down in the communities, chief to chief meetings with five different communities, rotating between coming to Montreal, being in Schefferville, being in Goose Bay, being in Sept Iles, being in Schefferville, and spending time to understand the needs, the desires of what an indigenous community work, how they want to participate. We have four IBAs with five of these groups, and I think IBAs are just the start. We're already having conversations around what does it look to take equity in certain projects? How do we engage further? How do we build the fabric around our operations with the indigenous communities? We have about 240 employees at IOC, out of the 3,000 that are indigenous. When I first started off, we were spending about $5 million a year in procurement. We hit 80 million last year and we're going to hit 80 - we're going to be over $80 million in procurement this year. So it's a win-win. And it's not a win-win at all costs. It's - we have to get great service and great products from our indigenous partners. But it's working and we're facilitating and working closely with them. Onto what gets me a bit excited is the Scope 3 and just not the Scope 1 and 2. We are targeting a 50% reduction in Scope 3 emissions from IOC by 2035. Currently, as Will mentioned, there's about two tonnes CO2 per tonne of steel produced using our products into natural gas, EAF and DRI, we can get that down to about one. And if you're really looking to the future around hydrogen, you get pretty close to net zero. But we don't do this at all costs. There are ways we can drive and increase our margins around this, and it's really shifting from our concentrate into our direct reduction pellets and getting it out of Asia and getting it closer into our North Atlantic, into a Middle East and Northern Africa. And seeing where that 6%, where we saw where our product sales are now, how do we increase that? That's where we're seeing a lot of the DRI, the EAF operations really blossoming. So we're working towards that. Also, we're seeing the DR pellet demand increasing in the Atlantic as well as we're seeing it really starting to speed up in terms of requests from hydrogen base. Just a year ago we made a MoU with H2 GS, Green Steel out of Sweden for two million tons of our product. I think it's starting in 2025. The thing that's interesting about IOC, because no one can say with a perfect clear shot what this energy transition looks like and what are the different product mixes that are going to occur during the steel transition to green steel? We have flexibility in the product we make. We can make a concentrate, we can make a blast furnace pellet, we can make a direct reduction pellet. And with a bit of capital investment, we can make a direct reduction pellet feed. And depending where the value proposition lies, we can play with those levers. Not only that, when you look at Scope 1 and Scope 2, we are well positioned as a low carbon mine. We are blessed in Labrador to have Churchill Falls just 400 kilometres away from us, with high, clean, green hydroelectric power that provides our powers requirements in Labrador City. And Sept Iles. We're not like aluminium, we don't have big hydro dam. But I got a small hydro dam that provides all my energy needs for our port, around 22 megawatts. So we do have infrastructure within IOC as well as Newfoundland and Labrador, ensuring that we have a green supply of energy. When you look at our emissions against Rio Tinto's, we're about a million tonnes out of the, call it 32.5%. The majority of ours comes from our induration machines, about 70% within the pellet plant. So what are we doing about some of those things? Well, first of all, we also are on some Bunker C boilers. We just installed a new electric boiler. It's being commissioned in 2024 at the end of this year for 40 megawatts. We're doing research and development on electric plasma burners to replace our Bunker C burners with their induration machines. That's about a third of our carbon emissions. And also R&amp;D, with some successful trials going on right now for coke elimination in our induration machines by using bio carbon. So we are striving on the Scope 1 and Scope 2 arena as well. In summary, even though on this slide you can see there's some decent results here over the last five years, I want to acknowledge to the group here that IOC has not met its full potential. However, we have developed a very robust plan and I'm very committed to execute this plan to meet our 23 million ton objective as well as the resulting financial results. Appreciate your time. Thank you very much. NIGEL STEWARD: Okay. Hi, everyone. In for the last stretch. My name is Nigel Steward. I'm the Chief Scientist of Rio Tinto. I've worked for the company for 36 years, and it's 40 years if you include my summer vacation jobs at the research centre in the UK. I'm here to talk about technology in R&amp;D. And what I'd like to do is cover really three things today: Our history of innovation and how we innovate within the company; secondly, I'll provide you with the highlights of three technologies that we're developing here in North America; and then, finally, I'll end with how we partner with industry players, startups and universities and government laboratories as well, so that we can innovate at pace. So we have a strong, proven history of innovation within the company. And if you think about Kennecott today, the Bingham Canyon mine, when that was opened, that was the pioneering example of open pit mechanised mining of low grade copper ore. That was the first in the world and that was created at Kennecott. Also froth flotation for concentrating that was created in Kennecott as well. Sophie talked earlier about the creation of the ilmenite smelting process here in the 1950s, another innovation in our business. We've also had commercial innovations as the Pilbara blend, which many of you know extremely well. Also, the way in which we sold our pink diamonds and extracted a lot of value through that auction process. Many of you also know in our iron ore business about the automated haul trucks, which have been - we pioneered that 12 years ago in the Pilbara. Also introduced AutoHaul on the rail network. And our latest innovation is the automated drilling rigs for our drill and blast operations in our open pit mines. Then finally, S\u00c3\u00a9bastien and J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me, earlier they talked a lot about our refinery and smelting technology. Because of the heritage companies of Alcan, Alusuisse, Comalco and Pechiney, we have alumina refineries that can process low temperature, medium temperature and high temperature bauxites. We're the only company in the world to have that kind of portfolio. We also have double digestion that Jono talked about. That's a technology that we first implemented and demonstrated at our refinery in Alcan about 35 years ago. On the smelting side, we have the leading AP smelting technology, and it's through the development of that technology that we've learned how to creep our smelters. So when you look at the nameplate design of the original smelter technologies that we operate today, today each one of those cells operates at a production capacity that's 50% higher than its original design. And S\u00c3\u00a9bastien alluded to that earlier on. That's that 400,000 tons just in this region of the world that we've produced extra without building another smelter. So in terms of our R&amp;D footprint, how we innovate across the company is that each one of our product groups and each one of our functions runs an R&amp;D activity. Also, we have our corporate laboratories in Melbourne and in Bundoora that I know some of you have visited. And we have over 600 team members actively involved in research and development across the company. We have 120 projects and we're spending over $400 million a year. One of the things I'd like to take the time to explain to you is our disciplined process of technology development. When you're developing technology, you go from an idea. You then take that idea forward to a proof-of-concept experiment. If that's successful, you move to a pilot. Then you go to an industrial demonstration and then finally to implementation. And between each of those steps, we have a stage gate process. So when we embark on a particular step, we set targets that we want to meet performance criteria. If we don't meet those performance criteria, we kill the project. If we do meet them, we go on to the next stage. What this slide shows, it just demonstrates where some of our projects in North America sit on this pipeline. So you can see there are two projects here, Tellurium and the HVO diesel, which are in implementation. So Tellurium you may have heard of before. This is what we're producing at Kennecott as a byproduct. It's a critical mineral. And it's going to first solar in the United States to make solar panels made from cadmium telluride. The HVO diesel is something that we did the industrial demonstration of that in Boron. And we've now rolled that out in Kennecott and Boron more widely. So this is a bio-diesel with a net-zero emission. The demonstration phase is quite interesting. Tomorrow you're going to be seeing the AP60 and the AP60 that you see in operation is the industrial demonstration of the AP60 technology. What we're now doing is adding 96 parts and moving that into the industrialisation phase. But the important point is that some of our demonstration projects end up being production units, but sometimes we confuse the two until. We've built those industrial demonstrations, you can't show to someone that you've really got a proven technology that you can implement. So that's the importance there. Two other projects at the moment that are in those demonstration phases are our Scandium work that you'll probably see on Friday when you visit Sorel, and also our underground battery vehicles that we're running at Kennecott in the underground project. What I'd like to spend some time talking to you about today are the three technologies that we're developing in North America that are in that pilot stage. So BlueSmelting, which Sophie talked about earlier, ELYSIS, and then finally Nuton. So the BlueSmelting process, what is it? If we look at the process today, which you'll see on the far left hand side, you'll see the way this works. What we do is we're using carbon to reduce ilmenite. And ilmenite is a mixture of titanium dioxide and iron oxide. The carbon that we use, the metallurgical coal, it can extract the oxygen from the iron oxide, but it can't extract the oxygen from the titanium oxide. The net result is that when we put it into the furnace with electric heating elements, what gets smelted is iron metal and the titanium oxide slag. And it's the titanium oxide slag that's the main product that we sell at RTIT. But also we have the iron as a byproduct. What we're doing in BlueSmelting, there are two stages to this. The first stage where we've achieved a 20% reduction in our CO2 emissions, is that we take the carbon monoxide that comes off from the smelting furnace. Normally that would go into our UGS process to upgrade the slag. And also there's an excess that gets vented off and burnt. And when it burns it produces CO2. We're taking that carbon monoxide and we're pre-reducing the ilmenite ore in a fluidized bed. So we're blowing carbon monoxide through the powdered material, and it's partially reducing that iron oxide. That pre-reduced ore is then fed into the smelting process. But we're replacing the metallurgical coal with the bio-carbon that Sophie mentioned. So that's a net zero source of carbon. By the time we've done all of this because we've recycled the carbon monoxide, we've pre-reduced the material and we're using the bio coke. We're achieving a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. And we proved this last year. For those of you who are in Sydney at the Capital Markets Day, I said that one of the things that was going to excite me about this year was switching from CO, carbon monoxide to hydrogen, and we're now operating this pre-production unit on hydrogen. And this is what you will see when you visit Sorel on Friday. In this case what we're doing is we are producing hydrogen made by electrolysis. So this is green hydrogen. The hydrogen is now being used to reduce that iron oxide in the ilmenite to iron. The material that's pre-reduced then goes into the smelter. And again, we're using a small amount of the bio carbon. And we end up with a 95% reduction in CO2 emissions. This is the work that we're ongoing at the moment. There's one key feature of this technology, which is really important to note and where the key breakthrough has to come, is that when you react hydrogen with iron ore, only about 8% to 9% of the hydrogen reacts. So the off gas is about - it contains about 10% water, which is your reaction product and 90% hydrogen. So that hydrogen is really expensive. So you need to recycle it. But you need to take the water out. So what happens is that gas has to be cooled, the water has to condense out, and you then have to reheat the hydrogen back up and inject it back into the furnace. This is the part that we're now looking at mastering. That's the technological breakthrough that needs to come. And incidentally, this is the same technological breakthrough that green iron smelting has to overcome as well. And many people don't tell you about that. But that's the key thing. And no one's actually demonstrated that step yet. Another thing about this technology that you may have twigged is that I talk a lot about the iron oxide being reduced to iron. This process can actually also be used to make green iron. We'll make green iron as a byproduct as we smelt ilmenite. But it could actually be used to reduce iron ore itself. And in fact, as we speak today, this furnace is being run on IOC or from Mike's operation. So ELYSIS. The industry has been trying to move towards the inert anode. So this is an anode that's not consumed during electrolysis in aluminium production. So back in 1886, when Hall and H\u00c3\u00a9roult invented this process, they made two technical breakthroughs. The first thing that they had to do is they needed to find a solvent that would dissolve alumina. And they eventually found that that was molten cryolite at about 970, 980 degrees C. The second thing they needed to figure out was how you would put an electrode that would survive in that environment. Because the molten cryolite is virtually a universal solvent, it will dissolve everything. That's why it dissolves alumina. So what that electrode material was, was really critical. So they started off trying lots of different materials, but they all ended up dissolving and contaminating the aluminium. Then they hit on the idea of using carbon. What happens is the oxygen that's evolved reacts with the carbon, produces CO2. So even though the carbon is consumed, it doesn't contaminate the metal. It disappears as a gas. And that's why aluminium smelters generate CO2. But people in the early 1900s became really, really interested in the inert anode again. The reason for that is when you look at the key cost drivers of aluminium smelting, your fourth major cost after alumina energy and people is carbon. So people started to pursue this and look at how they could produce an inert anode to eliminate carbon, to reduce the - or to change the cost structure and to reduce the cost of aluminium smelting. Later that evolved with the environmental movement, because the carbon that we use to make anodes comes from the petroleum industry. It's the residue from oil, the refining of crude oil, which contains sulphur. So sulphur and SO2 emissions started to become a problem in the 1970s. There was another impetus to look at the inert anode. Then in the 80s, our appreciation of the impact of CO2 on global warming and climate change started to appear, again, more impetus on trying to look at the inert anode. And there were giant programmes in the United States and in Europe and the European Union to look again at the inert anode. No one was able to solve the issue. Until in 2021, working with Alcoa, we built the first cell that produced pure aluminium metal without generating any CO2. This is not only important now, but it's going to be important for us as an industry in the future. Because if you think about it in the context of climate change, a carbon anode that we make today is made from a byproduct of the oil industry and a byproduct of blast furnace steelmaking. That's petroleum coke and coal tar pitch. In the context of the energy transition, they won't be there in the future. So we're going to have to solve this problem. So how do you do it? What's the secret? On the left-hand side you see a very, very simplified diagram of what the interior of current aluminium smelting technology looks like. Coming down from the top, where all those CO2s are written, you have the anode. It sits in that orange molten cryolite bath with the alumina dissolved in it, and at the bottom where the negative electrode is, you collect the aluminium metal. So when you put the alumina into the cell, it dissolves. It splits into aluminium 3+ and oxygen 2-. The aluminium 3+ is attracted because opposites attract to the negative electrode and the oxygen goes to the anode, the positive electrode. Then it reacts with the carbon and produces CO2. And you might think, if all I have to do is find a material that replaces the carbon and everything will be fine. But you end up with two challenges. There's the dissolution problem that I spoke about. But also there's another fundamental issue is that if you think about what carbon does, it's converting itself from carbon into CO2. That's exactly what you do if you burn a piece of coal or charcoal and that generates heat. So that carbon is actually an energy source into the cell. So if you remove it, you need to pass more and consume more electricity to compensate for that. So the electrical consumption or the electricity consumption of your cell goes up and you need to correct for that. Now you can do it by reducing the distance between the anode and the molten metal that sits in the bottom of the cell. But there's a limit to that because of effects I won't go into. That aluminium is moving around the swimming pool and it's creating waves. So it's just like a massive swimming pool. And you'll see an AP60 cell tomorrow. It's a swimming pool and it's circulating around. So - and that metal can't touch the anode because you short circuit the cell. So that limits the distance that you can go to. And this is the secret to ELYSIS. And that's what's on the right. You eliminate that problem by moving towards solid vertical electrode arrangements. Those solid vertical electrode arrangements help you in reducing the consumption of the material, and they also enable you to move those electrodes far, far closer together so you can eliminate that extra energy that you needed to add to the cell. And this is what we've been successful at doing and demonstrating. The next phase for us is we've made the scientific breakthrough for the first time ever in the history of the industry. We now need to convert a scientific breakthrough into a technological breakthrough. Now on to Nuton, another long timeline. So why is Nuton important? It's a heap leach technology. And heap leaching has been around for a long time. So what's really different about Nuton? And there are three things. The first thing is, is copper deposits come in many different types, many different ore types. And one of the things that we've never been able to really do in the industry is heap leach primary copper sulphides. So today what we have to do is we have to crush those up, float them in a concentrator - on a flotation circuit and then smelt them. So all of those technologies are very capital intensive. When we try to heap leach a primary copper sulphide, we'll get with traditional methods. We'll get about a 40% recovery of the copper. With Nuton, we found a way to achieve greater than 85%. So this is a way to get copper at a much, much lower capital cost. Also, it's a way to get copper at a much lower water consumption. Heap leaching uses about a 10th of the amount of water that flotation does. It also is a way to get at a much, much lower energy consumption because we don't have to crush down to 100 to 150 microns, which consumes a huge amount of energy. We just need to lightly crush, and we save about 65% in terms of energy consumption. So this has big Opex and big Capex advantages as a way to get to copper. The second thing that it can do is it provides us access to ores that we can't process today. There are in the world ores which are high grade copper, but they contain high arsenic. Nuton can treat high arsenic ore. The other thing that it can do is we can go back to our existing operations, where we mine primary copper sulphides and extract the residual copper from the waste. Again, this provides us another route to copper units, in an era - in an environment with climate change where we need to bring on copper with pace. So how does this work? What we do is we lightly crush the ore and we agglomerate it, and we combine it with bacteria and a small amount of sulfuric acid and some catalytic additives. We then place it onto a heap and irrigate it with water. And with that, we get up to 80% copper recovery. And most of the heavy lifting in this technology is done by the bacteria. We only had a small amount of acid if we have some oxides or some secondary sulphides in there. What leaches out of that is a soup, if you like, with - it will contain aluminium, magnesium, other things in the rock, but also the copper. So what you need to do is selectively extract that copper. And we do that with solvent -by solvent extraction. That's a process which already exists today. And it's used in routine heap leaching processes. That then solution, which is concentrated in copper, then goes to electrowinning where we go straight to the pure cathode. To support us and to help move with pace, we - well, there's two things we realise that we don't have the answers to all of the things that we need to know, and we need to bring in capability from the outside. So partnerships are extremely important in that respect. Also, when you work with other companies and in particular startups which are looking for similar solutions, working with them and partnering them helps us move with pace. And the movement with pace is really, really keen if you're going to address the energy transition. I'll just provide you with sort of two examples of two of the startups that we're working with. The first one is electric hydrogen. Electric hydrogen make what we feel is going to be one of the lowest cost routes to green hydrogen produced by electrolysis through their technology. And you saw earlier from Jona's presentation and also for the presentation on BlueSmelting is that we're looking to use hydrogen as a reducing agent to decarbonise some of our processes. The second one I'd like to talk about is Aymuim. Again. Sophie referred to Aymuim and that \u00c3\u2030volys, joint venture that we've just created to make biocarbon and that biocarbon we're seeing as an important way to decarbonise some of our businesses. It's an important contributor to BlueSmelting. We also see ways in which we can use this in our aluminium business, and also potentially in green steelmaking as well. The last thing I wanted to share with you is what we're doing with the Rio Tinto Future Materials, Centre for Future Materials. We established this last year to celebrate our 150th anniversary as a company. What we did is we created a network of universities in each of the major regions where we operate, and the centre has been run by Imperial College in London. So it's a partnership between Imperial, the University of British Columbia in Canada, University of California in Berkeley, Wits in South Africa and Australian National University in Australia. And what was said as an objective for them is to think about how we address the energy transition, how we supply the materials for the energy transition and how we do that with the zero carbon footprint and a much improved ESG footprint? So it's very much aligned with our purpose as a company. What we're searching for and looking for there are the ideas and the proof of concepts at the beginning of that pipeline, I described up front, ideas that come out of this are then things that we can pick up and run with. The first grand challenge that they've set for themselves relates to copper and about how can we bring on copper at pace? So this is the first challenge that they've set for themselves. So to end and to summarize, our purpose as a company is to provide the materials for the energy transition, and to do that, innovation, technology and R&amp;D will be required. Not all of the solutions to provide the materials for the energy transition currently exists today. We need to use technology innovation to deliver those materials with a zero-carbon footprint and a much-improved ESG footprint, and we need to partner with others to move at pace. And you've seen that partnership theme right the way through the day. Jono talked about our partnerships and renewable energies, and we have many, many partnerships in R&amp;D and technology. I hope also that you appreciate that within our industry, our technology program and our technology organization is a key differentiator, and we see it going forward as a key source of competitive advantage for the company. So thank you. Questions and Answers TOM GALLOP: Thank you, Nigel. I'll just let Sophie and Mike McCann on their way to the stage for the second Q&amp;A session. I really hope someone's going to ask Nigel why there's waves in the bottom of an aluminum cell. But I don't get to ask any questions, unfortunately. But who would like to ask the first question? Matt. MATT GREENE, ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.: Hi. Nigel. Matt Greene from Goldman Sachs. Just on Nuton. There's a lot of different catalytic additives out here, Jetti, but can you just talk on what it is you're adding in there? Because, I mean, I get the sense that there's a bit of pyrite, arsenopyrite, but is there something else in the mix here? Because, I mean, are you reliant on a concentrator to help feed into the agglomeration circuit there as well as additives? And then just if you could touch on the cycle time to get that 85% and kind of the heat management for the bacteria? NIGEL STEWARD: Well, the easiest one, the cycle times 200 days. And the additives, I won't divulge those, but some of them are actually naturally occurring in the rock, and you just need to know what they are. So I'll leave it at that. But really, the only additive that is purposefully added is the bacteria. And the bacteria that we use aren't synthetic biology-related cultures, monocultures. They're broader bacteria biomes that you naturally find associated with copper ore bodies as well. So we cultivate those and we find them to be - that's why we spent 30 years looking at this. We find them to be more robust and tolerant to changes in their environment, whereas the monocultures, they actually die. You need a complete support system of different types of bacteria to enable the whole biome to survive. MATT GREENE: And then just on ELYSIS. You mentioned the extra power needed per ton of aluminum. Can you confirm that ELYSIS doesn't consume more power than the current technology? NIGEL STEWARD: No, we're aiming to achieve the same. In fact, that was one of the key decisions for us to move from our single cell to the ten cells that we announced and that J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me and S\u00c3\u00a9bastien spoke about. That was one of the key KPIs that it needed to meet. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Jason Fairclough, Bank of America. A question for Sophie. So on your bridge to improved return on capital, a pretty big part of that is production. So I guess the question is how do you think about achieving better return on capital without achieving lower return on capital through lower prices? SOPHIE BERGERON: Same question as aluminum more or less. Look, for us, the base of production is very important as we have quite an important footprint. We've been through a couple of challenging years, as I mentioned, through PSM incidents. So that definitely didn't help as we had to deploy additional capital to rebuild. But when we are very strong, stable and we operate with discipline, that definitely shows up in our EBITDA margin. So that's also recovering the full co-products that we were producing is also very value added for our business. I don't know if I answered your question. And the price question is difficult to answer because the market is not moving the same way. Volume and price are not definitely aligned in our market, if that makes sense. So when the volumes are decreasing, we don't necessarily see a decrease right away in the price. So there are some lags. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Okay. And just a follow up question. Could you give us an update on the security situation in South Africa? SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah, absolutely. I mean it's known that we had a murder in 2021, which also didn't help as we were on force majeure for a long period in 2021. We've not only worked on our community engagement, government engagement, communication. So we've had like a really strong program to reinforce our position, support from stakeholders in the country. And we've also reinforced our security in the country. So we have currently a very good position and we have strong support overall. So that's why we are refreshing our study on Zulti South as we feel that we've never been in such good position. PAUL YOUNG: Question for Mike. Mike, you're right by saying with your overview on IOC that a few times we've heard about the potential of IOC and trying to achieve nameplate. You outlined a pretty compelling case to, I guess, take advantage of that latent capacity. But you also highlighted that strip ratios are going up, and a lot of the equipment needs a bit of a workover and reinvestment. So - but you've shown some good progress so far. To get to the 23 million tonnes per annum, do you have any idea of what it's going to cost as far as CAPEX is concerned, noting that CAPEX actually has stepped up a fair bit at IOC already in the last two years? MIKE MCCANN: Yeah, it's going to be fairly minimal. It's really around best practices. When we look at some of the investment that we have included to 23 million, it's about $160 million for our pellet plant expansion, and that would give us an increase in our weight yield. And that's about it. The rest is really around - our sustaining CAPEX stays the same. Yes, we got some more additional strip ratio, but that's all built into it in terms of just our incremental expansion. But the big one-off would be our pellet plant expansion, getting additional weight yield and give us flexibility to increase our pellet production. PAUL YOUNG: Thank you. And maybe just switching to Nigel, another question on analysis. And one of the big advantages I can see is the fact that your anodes at the moment. Correct me if I'm wrong. You have to replace them each month. And I think the life of your inert anodes, I think, are 30x the life of a carbon anode. So ultimately, if you're not changing out your carbon anodes and taking your pots down, you're getting an automatic production increase from that smelter from the same size cells. So it seems pretty compelling. It must be a reasonably large number. Can you talk through potentially the - any production uplift we might see from ELYSIS? NIGEL STEWARD: Well, when we look at ELYSIS, we should be getting production uplift. So say for the larger cells, today we operate - let's say, like our AP40 is at about 416 ka. And with ELYSIS, we'll operate that same - we retrofit into that same cell area, we're up to 450. So we get an amperage increase. And that's largely due to that the fact that we can bring the electrodes closer together. We should also get probably a current efficiency type increase as well, because you're disturbing the cell less when you change the anodes. So there'll be an uplift there. But all of that is really - that's the reason why we need to go through these industrial demonstrations with multiple cells in a cell room to demonstrate all of that, and to understand fully what the impact will be. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Just on Richards Bay, without Zulti South, the production profile, like you talk about going up to 1.5 million tons, I think, which is still obviously well below capacity. What's the gap between achieving the full capacity across those operations? Is it resource constrained? Is it a processing constraint? And also without Zulti South, what does the production profile for Richards Bay look like? How many years? Because I think you said 15 year reserve life left in Africa. But I assume that includes QMM, etc.. So the life options around Richards Bay if you don't have Zulti South as a getting through the study phase? SOPHIE BERGERON: So Zulti North, we're starting to see some decrease in production in early 2030, so '31, '32. That's why we are, as I said, entertaining other options. So we could get - if Zulti South, should it be delayed again, we could get another feed for RBM. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: And also just - obviously the improvement in returns is driven by the increase in capacity, but it's not like you're increasing capacity to fully utilise the asset. Is that just a market constraint? SOPHIE BERGERON: You mean the market constraint on - JASON FAIRCLOUGH: You said capacity is over 2 million tons, but you're only talking about taking up to 1.5 million tons by 2030. So why not full capacity utilisation? SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah. Actually, Richards Bay is not at full capacity. And that's one of the reasons. I mean, we're conscious that the depletion of the ore body is going quite fast. So we're looking definitely at other options to bring that feed. And Sorel has much more capacity to increase rapidly production than Richards Bay. I hope I answered your question in some way. So the capacity is there. And should we have the feed? And as I said, we have options. We entertain Mutamba, Kamiesberg currently. So there's options for Richards Bay to bring some feed, but the capacity is definitely there, not fully used as we speak for the reasons I explained. DOMINIC O'KANE: Nigel, you mentioned $400 million i think you said was the R&amp;D spend. Where has that come from and where is it going to, this $400 million? Is that the number we should think about for the next few years? NIGEL STEWARD: Well, where does it come from? It comes from each of the product groups and corporate. So that's the way it's funded. And roughly 70% is funded by the product groups, and it's more targeted towards more shorter term commercial and operational needs. And then the remaining 20%, 30% is on the more strategic things. So these are things like Nuton, ELYSIS, etc. And the way it's split, there was a pie chart actually on there. If you think about impeccable ESG, best operator and excel in development, about half of the spend is on impeccable ESG. And most of that is the decarbonization work. We've got about - I think it's about, if my memory is correct, about 18%, 20% on best operator and supporting that activity, and the rest is on our growth. So excel in development. DOMINIC O'KANE: So when I said, breakout - I mean, was it $400 million three years ago and is $400 million the number we should think on a recurring basis? NIGEL STEWARD: $400 million on a recurring basis. And when we really relaunched technology and R&amp;D in the company, and we talked about that in Capital Markets Day back in London two years ago, that's when we really relaunched it, and we actually doubled our spend. And that's what we aim to spend on a continuous basis. GRANT SPORRE: Hi. It's Grant from Bloomberg Intelligence. Just a question for Nigel. Just you talked about the configuration of the anodes and how that solved one problem. Without obviously giving away, what progress did you make in terms of the composition of the anode in terms of what material? So it doesn't dissolve in the cryolite bath? And does the chemistry in the bath actually have to change at all? NIGEL STEWARD: You do need to modify the chemistry of the bath, the electrolyte. So that's part of it. The material - we've really honed in on a material both for the anode and the cathode. The cathode wasn't so much a challenge, whereas the anode was. The key thing for us going forward now is that when you think about the industry today, we have a supply chain network to supply us. And that's now because we're moving from a carbon anode and a carbon cathode to these new materials, we need to build the supply chains for those. And so the best way to think of this, is about the supply chain that we have today for our cathodes, where we have independent cathode producers that produce our cathodes. And the cathodes will last in the cell for the lifetime of the cell. We're now going to have to do the same thing for these new cathode materials, but also for the anodes. So that's the supply chain that we've now got to start to build. And it's one of the key things that will influence the rate at which LSS evolves. The supply chains need to follow us as well. RICHARD HATCH: Thanks. Hello. Richard Hatch, Berenberg. Sophie, a question for you on the TiO2 business. I've asked this question to your management team before. You know, there's a few producers of TiO2 ilmenite trading on the open market, maybe 1, 2 times EBITDA. Is there a point in which you have to look for undervalued juniors in the TiO2 space to buy, ilmenite, for example, like a Kenmare? And then just on the other hand of that, if I look at the carbon footprint of rutile versus ilmenite, say, or TiO2 slag, it's significantly lower. So do you think that 1.5 million tonnes of production in TiO2 could see some slag displacement with rutile? SOPHIE BERGERON: Look, it's a long question. In terms of rutile, it's not a huge part of the market. And we're seeing some depletion of rutile, and that's one of the reasons why we also secured the position in Sovereign in Malawi. We have also our UGS product, which is as good as rutile in the market. And as we are decarbonizing our processes, we will get to a point that in terms of carbon footprint, we can compete on both sides on the TiO2 content as well as the carbon footprint. So look, it depends on the customers because I could answer the questions for some of our customers have different situation and some others are also - their needs are all different. So we see they will use mix. They don't use necessarily like one feedstock as you know. When it's lower market, we see more ilmenite flowing obviously direct. When market is improving, so they prefer what we call sweetening with slag and rutile and UGS is also very popular. There is not enough rutile in the market to provide the feedstock that the world needs. RICHARD HATCH: And just on looking at M&amp;A to give you the feedstock that you might need for RBM. SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah. I mean we have good options in the portfolio already. So there's no reason why we wouldn't explore our options internally before. RICHARD HATCH: Okay. Thanks. And then just one for Mike. Mike, if I look at my numbers, IOC used to have an operating cost base of about $1 billion, and it's now about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. So by your 20% reduction, are we right in saying that we should reduce our OPEX over time by about 300 million. And just does that - does that include - is there any adjustment for royalties in that? And then CAPEX, about $350 million long term. Is that the right number? Because that's what you've basically spent the last three years. MIKE MCCANN: Yeah, $350 million is about right. But also in terms of our unit costs, we're taking $100 million out in cost savings approaches just for next year on a Canadian basis. So we're looking at our contractor spend, contractor management as well as looking at our organisational structure and our headcount associated with that. So working it from both fronts. Our biggest lever for sure is production. But we're also looking on the cost front. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Just a question for the Chief Scientist. So Nuton, have you guys done any benchmarking against some of the other novel leach technologies that seem to be floating around against Jetti, against the Copper Chlor Tetc? NIGEL STEWARD: Nigel Steward: Yes, we have. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Jason Fairclough: And anything you could share? NIGEL STEWARD: Well, what our conclusion is we come up with a lower sort of operating cost technology and we have the highest recoveries as well. That seems to be the key theme. And the reason why our operating costs are so much lower is because the bacteria do a lot of the heavy lifting. We're not adding other reagents to the system, and that's really the key driver of it. So that's what we're concluding so far. And that's what's given us the confidence to, as you saw on the slide to do that first industrial demonstration. So we're going to be doing this in Arizona. We're building a 3 million tonne heap. And that's in construction at the moment. And we should be extracting our first metal middle of next year. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: And in terms of ore bodies, can Nuton be used on any ore body? So I mean, is it good for Escondida. Is it good for Kennecott? NIGEL STEWARD: No. We've trialed many different ore bodies. So we know pretty much the characteristics that we need. The last test that we did, large test that we did, which was pilot scale, was at Kennecott with the 70,000 tonne heap. So we know that works at Kennecott, for example. We're confident from the ore samples that we have from Escondida that it could work there as well. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Okay. Thank you. GLYN LAWCOCK: Hi. It's Glyn Lawcock of Barrenjoey. Firstly, Nigel, is there anything you can put from a numbers perspective. You keep talking about its lower cost versus peers, lower capital intensity. Can you quantify that at all or is it still too early? For both ELYSIS and Nuton. You're not throwing any numbers at us. I mean, like, what are we talking about in terms of - NIGEL STEWARD: It's early days yet, Glyn. We do have numbers that we've done for the benchmark for Nuton. I just don't have them at the top of my head. So maybe we can get back to you on that. ELYSIS, it's still early days. If you think about ELYSIS, with the cell that we have that we've developed so far, if you think about it, we've got the engine of the car, but we don't have the car. You have to build the potline, the buildings, all of the peripheral equipment, the scrubber systems, all of those sorts of things. You need to put all of those things in. So that's the reason we're doing this ten-part cell demonstration to start building that knowledge and starting to estimate that. So that's just where we are in the process at the moment on ELYSIS. It's just too premature. But what we're doing and what we're targeting is our KPIs. If you remember, like we have those stage gate process, the KPIs that we're looking for, we're aiming to really generate the same sort of returns that we have for normal smelting technology. And certainly looking at CapEx costs, around the $7,000, $8,000 per tonne mark. TOM GALLOP: Just on Nuton, Glyn. So what we've said, it's around 40% lower from a capital intensity perspective. And also if you look at, say, CO2 60% lower and water consumption 80% more efficient. GLYN LAWCOCK: At 40% lower, because that 40% below a large company CAPEX or a small company CAPEX for a copper business? TOM GALLOP: Reasonable peer benchmarks, Glyn. GLYN LAWCOCK: All right. And then, Sophie, just a quick question. Sorry. You made a comment about China. The industry pivoted to China pigment and you weren't there to take advantage. It took you two years to catch up. So now you're using China as your customer base. But now the tariffs, switch it back to Europe and the Western world. How quickly can you shift your business now if the whole pigment industry now shifts ex-China because of the tariffs as well? SOPHIE BERGERON: Look there's definitely some movements right now based on the tariffs that will be applied in November. However, we don't see it as just a temporary situation when the tariffs will be enforced. So we will see other movements. So our Western customers will definitely get probably some market back. But everything's going to shift at the end of the day. So for us it's all about like what each customer needs and how we can supply them with the best mix we have in our portfolio. So China is still importing ilmenite. They're still importing feedstock. So at the end of the day they will provide other people elsewhere. Asia is a big consumer, actually. India is a big consumer of pigment. GLYN LAWCOCK: And just finally, your timeline for Zulti South. You're doing the study. When should we expect that to be complete and when would you think you go to FID on it? SOPHIE BERGERON: Look, it's a refresh of feasibility study. So it's not that long to do. We expect that by next year it's done, the refresh. GLYN LAWCOCK: And then it needs to go ahead then. Or you can delay it further? SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah. We're starting small work there this fall. But for the big version of Zulti South, we were waiting for to see how it goes. And we will be ready with feasibility study ready to go. TOM GALLOP: But Glyn, just to clarify a lot that would need to go through the Board for sanction effectively at that point once your study is complete. PAUL YOUNG: Hi. So I have a question on the market. Just mineral sands more broadly. Two parts to the question. First one, just near-term, we've seen a bit of a bouncy year for mineral sands, particularly titanium dioxide feedstock. We had pigment markets sort of recovering in the June quarter or during the June quarter. Now sort of soften it a little bit. But then you made the comment that you see actually the market has an upward trend. So I'm just curious about what you're seeing near term? And any commentary you can throw into the mix on zircon just on near-term as well? And then on the medium term, I'm a little bit confused because on slide 21, in the pack you've got a supply and demand chart, and it actually shows the market's in a little bit of a surplus for the next two years. I'm talking titanium dioxide feedstock. Yet you're saying the market showed ilmenite. I'm just trying to square all of that away because, I mean, I think it sounds as though you're pretty positive on the medium term, but maybe the charts don't suggest that. SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah. So first off, after COVID, as you can see on the charts, we've seen like a big peak of demand, 2022 was a peak year. That's no doubt. After that - and it was really everyone started to renovate their houses. Big construction boom. China was okay at that time. Now it's - after that we've seen like a kind of a plateau, quieter time after the 2022 peak. And there's always a cycle of restocking and destocking and we are seeing that cycle of restocking so slowly. We - as we're always in communication with our customers, the pigment customers, we see that it's restarting, especially in the West. China is not at the level of recovering that much, but the rest - and India is recovering quite well. India is very active, so we see some movements. In terms of ilmenite, there's definitely some feed. And we've seen when the market was booming, especially after COVID, China was importing a lot of feed from Mozambique, from even Madagascar. So we've seen movements of quite low quality type of ilmenite. So that's where we think our products can displace some of also the lower quality feed for better value in use. So that's the way we're looking at the market. And also some of the deposits are depleting. So that's the big mining that happened just after COVID was not necessarily sustainable everywhere. PAUL YOUNG: And just to follow up, I know it's a small commodity for you. But just on zircon I mean, how do you look? How do you see zircon relative to TiO2 as far as supply demand is concerned over the medium term? Or do you just collectively look at them together? SOPHIE BERGERON: Yeah. Zircon is another one that is linked to construction. So real estate market. It goes mainly in ceramic and consumables glass CV. So look, we see zircon currently, it's not - we're not a huge producer, by the way. PAUL YOUNG: You're still top three, though. SOPHIE BERGERON: I mean, but compared to others, we're not the top one. The market is, I would say, okay, slightly recovering as well with the movement of real estate market. And depending where you place the product as well, it's like the market is different. Again China is not back there. PAUL YOUNG: Yeah. Can I ask one more to Nigel, Tom? Squeeze it in? Nigel, another question on Nuton. I think first of all, an observation is that the only copper mine that you own or have a share in that has spare capacity is Escondida. And we were talking about this earlier. So that's probably the biggest opportunity. So I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on where - what the potential pathways on primary sulphides at Escondida. And then second opportunity could be either at Bingham. I'm sure it's got heaps of low-grade primary sulphides. And then the third one could be the fact that your technology seems to be - has pulled ahead, if I could call that. Lots of other companies have lots of spare cathode capacity. So it's early days, I know, but what's the - I guess, the grand vision for Nuton as far as creating value for Rio Tinto? NIGEL STEWARD: Well, I would like to think as all of the above, right? So - but it's early stages. And I come - I've had a background in the company of providing technology to the world, right, of selling and commercialising technology. And you can't really convince someone to buy a technology until you can show them the industrial demonstration. So that's really the key step, the key next step for us. And that's what we're building at the moment in Arizona with a partner there. So once that's up and running and we can bring potential customers and internal customers as well as our JV partners at Escondida. And we can show them that, it's - I think that's really the key next step for us. And that's where we're focusing. RICHARD HATCH: Nigel, just one quick clarification on the BlueSmelting. Are you currently on stage two in terms of pilot, or are you just at stage one at this point? Sorry, just point of clarification. NIGEL STEWARD: We're doing the stage two work. So we've converted to hydrogen as the reducing gas. And - but we're not doing the hydrogen recycling loop yet that I spoke of. But we're doing the pre-reduction. So we're doing with hydrogen exactly what we did with carbon monoxide. So what we're doing is we're pr-reducing the ore. So we're taking an Fe2O3 and removing some of the oxygen, but not all of it. So we're reducing it to FeO. And the FeO is then going into the conventional smelter. But ultimately what we will do is go - once you master that recycling loop for the hydrogen, you can take that iron to the Fe2O3, to Fe, to the iron and do the full reduction. And then we'll just feed it into the what's the smelter today. Just as the melting process to separate the TiO2 slag from the metal itself. RICHARD HATCH: Okay. So do you think you could almost go ahead with stage one first and then wait for perhaps the technology to catch up and then. NIGEL STEWARD: That's right. It's a phased approach. RICHARD HATCH: Cool. And then potentially if it all goes to plan, your ability to bring that in - so commercially what's the timeframe on that? What could it be? NIGEL STEWARD: It's like I say, we're at pilot stage now. We do the pilot, we meet the KPIs, and then we'll think about the demonstration phase. So the thing that's going through our mind in the demonstration phase is, do we use the existing pre-production unit and just run it like an operation, and that becomes our demonstration? Or do we actually design a slightly bigger one to match the size of the furnaces? So that's the reflection we're going through. That's maybe a question for the team on Friday. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: I might just pick up on a comment you made earlier about smelting iron in one of these furnaces. How does that tie into the work that you're doing jointly with BHP on the ESF down in Australia? NIGEL STEWARD: It's complementary because when you think about the hydrogen reduction of iron ore, so that pre-reducing unit that we're trialling at Sorel could actually be that reduction unit that produces iron ultimately. And for example POSCO, they're converting their fluidized bed process called FINEX that runs on natural gas. They're converting it to what they call HyREX that runs on hydrogen. So it's kind of the equivalent of that, and it's equivalent to the HYFOR process, for example, that Primetals are generating as well that will run on hydrogen. So there's that. That's the way you use fines, iron ore fines to make to reduce to iron. And then the same thing with the Mike was talking about H2 Green Steel where we're making pellets and they're reducing those in a shaft furnace. That's the type of furnace that you normally use for natural gas at the moment. But you can convert that to run on hydrogen as well. So that's what H2 Green Steel is doing. But the output products from that are pure iron. And pure iron melts at a really high temperature above 1535 degrees C. So you need to have a melter to then melt and recover the metal. And you need to actually add carbon because steel is an iron carbon alloy, and when you add the carbon, you also bring the temperature down as well. So you need to have this electric furnace to do that. So the BHP work and the partnership there is complementary to this - to all of those green iron reduction processes. JASON FAIRCLOUGH: Okay. Thanks. Awesome. AUSTIN YUN: Maybe one question for Mike please. You have this target to increase your shipping performance by 31%. A big chunk of that is on the rail performance. I'm wondering if you could just provide a bit of a timeline of how you're going to get there. How long would that take? And also, would you try to prioritize your own uptime first before allocating the capacity to the companies sharing the service? Thank you. MIKE MCCANN: So in terms of getting our rail operation up and going? AUSTIN YUN: Yes. MIKE MCCANN: So that has been progressing. We're getting very, very close to where we need to be. One avenue we're working on right now is our cycle time. And we have a team on that. We see probably by the end of Q1 next year, having some certain performance uplifts from that. In terms of our third party, we try to balance everything about even. We do have contractual commitments with them. So you won't see IOC or being at 80% in our third party at 20%, it doesn't work that way. TOM GALLOP: We've reached time. Sorry, Glyn. Thanks, everyone, for the questions and the discussion today. I hope you really got a greater insight around the quality of the business here in North America. We are the largest metals and mining company in North America. Not everyone actually realizes that. And it's actually 25% of our copper equivalent production. But if you think about the quality of the assets, the quality of the renewable assets, the diversity of the business and the markets that we're facing, we think it's something that's a bit misunderstood from the market around the quality and the value that can be unlocked. So hopefully through the discussions today and over the next few days, that understanding can be built a little further. But thank you all for the discussion today. Thanks from myself on behalf of the wider team, just for your time today and the discussion, we've really enjoyed it.

Crews are also fighting several separate blazes in forested areas of Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky as wide swaths of those states face moderate to severe drought conditions and higher-than-normal temperatures. The 431-acre fire in Henderson County, N.C., has destroyed two homes, a cabin and an outbuilding, county officials said in a social media post Sunday that declared a state of emergency. Officials have identified 75 other structures that are threatened and said fire departments are focusing on structure protection while North Carolina Forest Services is focusing on putting in fire lines. </p><p>Meanwhile, crews are fighting a blaze in Cherokee County that has grown to more than 2,100 acres but is not threatening structures, the Forest Service said. The North Carolina Forest Service issued a burn ban Sunday for 14 counties in the western part of the state due to hazardous forest fire conditions and said it would stay in effect until further notice. \"Several counties in Western North Carolina are currently in a severe drought, and we are seeing wildfire activity increase due to dry conditions. Because dry conditions are expected to continue this burn ban is necessary to reduce the risk of fires starting and spreading quickly,\" the statement said. In Virginia, the state Department of Forestry said a wildfire near Madison County has led officials to encourage some residents to evacuate as crews work to stop the blaze from spreading. That fire had burned nearly 2,500 acres Sunday, but no structures have been affected and firefighters were installing additional fire lines to maintain that, the agency said. In eastern Kentucky, where conditions were also dry, the top official in Harlan County issued a burn ban and a state of emergency Sunday, saying there had been six forest fires in the last three days \"that has caused a significant strain on first responder agencies.\" Two firefighters were injured \"while attempting to protect life and property,\" Harlan County Judge-Executive Dan Mosley said. In West Virginia, wildfires estimated to be at least 500 acres burned Monday in the Cabin Creek area, southeast of the state capital of Charleston. The Kanawha County Commission requested that the state issue a complete burn ban for the county. Currently outdoor burning is allowed statewide between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Dry conditions in the state were expected to continue through Thursday. Crews were fighting two fires in eastern Tennessee including one in Rocky Top, but no injuries have been reported and no structures are in danger, Anderson County officials told news outlets. Clinton Fire Department Lt. Daniel Adams said the area is very dry and that combined with leaves covering the ground create ripe conditions for brush fires. \"Anything as simple as a cigarette being flicked out your window or disregarding some ashes - stuff we wouldn't be as concerned about right now - we are tremendously concerned about because of the dryness,\" Adams told WBIR-TV. Other parts of the U.S. are seeing unseasonably warmer temperatures and dry conditions this week. The Dallas-Fort Worth area saw highs in the 80s, about 10 degrees warmer than average.

(AP) \u2014 Officials have declared a state of emergency in a western North Carolina community where a wildfire has burned hundreds of acres, some structures and now is threatening dozens of homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crews are fighting several separate blazes in forested areas of Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky as wide swaths of those states face <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/data-snapshots/data-source/drought-monitor\">moderate to severe drought condition</url> s and warmer than normal temperatures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 431-acre (174-hectare) fire in Henderson County, North Carolina, has destroyed two homes, a cabin and an outbuilding, county officials said in a social media post Sunday that declared a state of emergency. Officials have identified 75 other structures that are threatened and said fire departments are focusing on structure protection while North Carolina Forest Services is focusing on putting in fire lines.</p><p>Meanwhile, crews are fighting a blaze in Cherokee County that has grown to more than 2,100 acres (850 hectares), but is not threatening structures, the U.S. Forest Service said.</p><p>The North Carolina Forest Service issued a burn ban Sunday for 14 counties in the western part of the state due to hazardous forest fire conditions and said it would stay in effect until further notice.</p><p>\u201cSeveral counties in Western North Carolina are currently in a severe drought, and we are seeing wildfire activity increase due to dry conditions. Because dry conditions are expected to continue this burn ban is necessary to reduce the risk of fires starting and spreading quickly,\" the statement said.</p><p>In Virginia, the state Department of Forestry said a wildfire near Madison County has led officials to encourage some residents to evacuate as crews work to stop the blaze from spreading. That fire had burned nearly 2,500 acres (1,012 hectares) on Sunday, but no structures have been affected and firefighters were installing additional fire lines to maintain that, the agency said.</p><p>In eastern Kentucky, where conditions were also dry, the top official in Harlan County issued a burn ban and a state of emergency on Sunday, saying there had been six forest fires in the last three days \u201cthat has caused a significant strain on first responder agencies.\u201d</p><p>Two firefighters were injured \u201cwhile attempting to protect life and property,\u201d Harlan County Judge-Executive Dan Mosley said.</p><p>In West Virginia, wildfires estimated to be at least 500 acres burned Monday in the Cabin Creek area, southeast of the state capital of Charleston. The Kanawha County Commission requested that the state issue a complete burn ban for the county. Currently outdoor burning is allowed statewide between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Dry conditions in the state were expected to continue through Thursday.</p><p>Crews were fighting two fires in East Tennessee including one in Rocky Top, but no injuries have been reported and no structures are in danger, Anderson County officials told news outlets.</p><p>Clinton Fire Department Lt. Daniel Adams said the area is very dry and that combined with leaves covering the ground create ripe conditions for brush fires.</p><p>\u201cAnything as simple as a cigarette being flicked out your window or disregarding some ashes \u2014 stuff we wouldn\u2019t be as concerned about right now \u2014 we are tremendously concerned about because of the dryness,\u201d Adams told WBIR-TV.</p><p>Other parts of the U.S. are seeing unseasonably warmer temperatures and dry conditions this week. The Dallas-Fort Worth area saw highs in the 80s, about 10 degrees warmer than average. Milder weather also stretched into the Midwest, where Wichita, Kansas, was seeing temperatures stretch toward 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). A cold front creeping into the Central and Southern Plains later in the week was expected to push highs down to normal for this time of year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-206eb970443e9aa06d76b049a2d2bea720231106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69JY-8GC1-JC5B-G238-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><timeReceived>9:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

It describes the difference between how much moisture is in the air, and how much moisture the air can hold when it's saturated (which is when dew forms.) The greater this difference, or deficit, the the greater the air's drying power on fuels.</p><p>Importantly, warmer air can hold more water, which means that VPD increases - and fuels will dry out more often - with rising temperatures due to climate change.</p><p>The researchers used satellite records of fire activity and a global climate dataset to find the maximum daily VPD for every fire detection - over 30 million records in the last 20 years, including almost one million in Australia.</p><p>They then measured the strength of the relationship between VPD and fire activity for different forest types in each continent on earth.</p><p>The researchers showed for the first time that in many forests around the world, from temperate eucalypt forests to boreal coniferous forests and tropical rainforests, there is a strong link between fire activity and how thirsty the air is at a daily timescale.</p><p>The results show that forest fire is much more likely above a certain threshold in VPD. This threshold was found to differ predictably between forest types, being lower in boreal (predominantly northern European and American coniferous forests) and temperate forests, and higher in Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical forests.</p><p>Research lead, Dr Hamish Clarke from the University of Melbourne FLARE Wildlife Research group, said that all around the world we're likely to see more of the conditions under which forests dry out and become flammable.</p><p>\"Some of the biggest areas of concern are the Amazon rainforest and other tropical forests, as well as northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests,\" Dr Clarke said.</p><p>Increasing forest fire activity could have major implications for carbon storage and human health via wildfire smoke impacts.</p><p>\"Without strong climate action, there will be many more days each year - at least 30 - when Earth's forests cross over into this critical flammability zone. This means we're likely to see more major fires, with all the risks that come with them,\" Dr Clarke said.</p><p>\"It is currently estimated that over 330,000 annual deaths globally are attributable to smoke inhalation, a number that could increase notably by the turn of the century, particularly in the most populated areas of east Asia.\"</p><p>Researchers said the presence of reliable links between atmospheric dryness and forest fire risk means that we should be able to develop better fire predictions, at both seasonal and near-term scales.</p><p>\"This could have significant benefits for those currently trying to fight, manage or coexist with fire,\" Dr Clarke said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>JOURNAL: Nature Communications<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34966-3\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34966-3</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/november/major-fires-an-increasing-risk-as-the-air-gets-thirstier,-research-shows\">https://www.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/november/major-fires-an-increasing-risk-as-the-air-gets-thirstier,-research-shows</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-8009230 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8009230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6706-BF71-DYG2-R4GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 30, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He remembers the thick stench of smoke, the sound of chatter crackling through his radio, the physical vibrations of the other tankers nearby-a total sensory overload. \"It was like drinking from a firehose,\" he says. But he knew he'd made the right decision.        </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the spring of 2014, and a fire-likely ignited by sparks flung from railroad tracks-was tearing through a forest in Alberta, Canada. Blois had never worked as an aerial firefighter before. Typically, on top of their training, new hires will fly as a copilot for their first few flights. Because Blois had significant flight experience, he started off as a captain immediately. </p><p>Blois, 49, began flying professionally in 1999.          He spent the early years of his career picking up whatever seasonal flying opportunities came his way. First, he worked as a minnow trapper, which entailed flying a little Piper PA-8 Super Cub float plane-a \"flying aquarium\"-to small lakes dotted across northern Ontario, collecting bait fish that had been caught in traps overnight. He then became a pilot for commercial seaplane operators that primarily served sport-fishing lodges and Indigenous communities in the remote north. Later, he booked gigs flying to and from the Arctic and the Antarctic.       </p><p>He first took up aerial firefighting a decade ago on the suggestion of his best friend, a fellow pilot named William Hilts. \"It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on,\" Hilts had told him. </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7c9eacc3-580d-485c-9467-53ad5e10fd46\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>Pilot Brad Blois first began training as an aerial firefighter in 2014.</p><p>Hilts had long dreamed of becoming a pilot. His          grandfather had served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and from him Hilts had inherited a uniform and mementos. During a camping trip when Hilts was 17, he and his family drove past a forest fire in northern British Columbia, where they caught glimpses of fire-bombers gliding through the air.       </p><p>Blois and Hilts had first become friends after bonding over their shared love for aviation, hunting, and fishing. One time, the two men came across a strange job listing on an internet forum for pilots. A museum in Europe was looking for someone to fly a 1952 Beech 18 seaplane from Vancouver Island to Belgium. They daydreamed about taking on the assignment. It would be an adventure of a lifetime,          Hilts had said. Then they moved on.        </p><p>ELY APPROACHED LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PILOTS WITH A SIMPLE PROPOSAL: WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HACK THEIR AIRCRAFT TO CARRY AND RELEASE WATER? </p><p>When Hilts urged him to consider aerial firefighting         , Blois was drawn in by the promise of a stable income and a set schedule. Back in 2013, he had applied for an opening and was assigned by the following year to a crew based in Alberta with Hilts and a few others. Blois remembers that first fire season fondly, reminiscing to me about the gradual understanding he developed around the chaotic nature of fire, the deep bonds he built with crewmates who quickly became family.       </p><p>Bonds like these are a lifeline in a profession as erratic and hazardous as wildland firefighting. Like most professions on the front lines of the climate crisis, aerial firefighting is defined by its uncertainty, especially as fire seasons grow longer          and more extreme. Today, government agencies and industry contractors are racing to develop firefighting technology that rises to the challenge posed by worsening wildfires.        </p><p>Just a year into his career as an aerial firefighter, Blois made the difficult choice to put aerial firefighting on pause. With two sons to raise, he decided to spend more time on the ground. </p><p>Hilts, meanwhile, stayed on the job, taking up another season of firefighting. </p><p>                                        THE DEVELOPMENT OF AERIAL FIREFIGHTING                              dates back around a century, when forest managers at state and federal agencies looked up into the sky and wondered if airplanes-capable as they were of delivering food and supplies to firefighters in the backcountry-could be used to deliver water to treetops, as well.        </p><p>One U.S. Forest Service fire chief by the name of Howard Flint gave the idea a go in the early 1930s, kicking a beer keg filled with water out of an airplane as it soared over Felts Field airport in Spokane, Washington, curious about how much surface area the splash might cover. \"The result          was not promising,\" a later report noted.        </p><p>In 1954, the U.S. Forest Service and the California Division of Forestry launched \"Operation Firestop,\" a collaborative fire-research initiative aimed at developing advanced firefighting techniques. This caught the attention of an agency employee named Joseph Ely, who worked as a fire control officer based in the          Mendocino National Forest in California.       </p><p>Ely approached local agricultural pilots with a simple proposal: Would it be possible to hack their aircraft to carry and release water? One pilot cut a hole out of the bottom of his biplane and installed a          tank with a hinged gate. To that, he attached a rope that, when pulled, unlatched the gate. He filled the tank up with water, then lit a small patch of grass on fire. Another pilot took the modified biplane into the air, yanked the rope, and put the fire out.        </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"b366ab9d-17a0-4742-950e-195c7c8a04d2\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>William Hilts, above, and Brad Blois quickly bonded over their shared love of nature and aviation.</p><p>\"We were in business,\" Ely wrote in an essay about the developments he oversaw, published in the          Journal of Forest History.           The first air tankers had minuscule capacities, carrying around 100 gallons of water each. \"It didn't amount to much,\" Ely conceded. \"But in it we sensed the glamour and romance of a daring new idea that was bound to          work and was beginning to prove itself.\"        </p><p>Just as aircraft underwent technological advancement, so did fire-suppression chemicals. In the early years of aerial firefighting, aviators primarily dropped water. This proved frustratingly inefficient, as some fraction of water always evaporated in the heat of the fire. Chemical adaptations quickly evolved, including foam-and-water mixtures that were more voluminous and longer-lasting. Today, those are used in conjunction with long-term fire retardants, vibrantly red-dyed chemical compounds that are used          to halt the growth of fires along their perimeter.        </p><p>Early experimental air tankers were built out of Boeing Stearmans and Naval Aircraft Factory N3Ns, aircraft first used for military training and later repurposed for use in farming as crop dusters. Quickly, the Forest Service started to fold bigger aircraft into its fleet, such as Grumman F7F Tigercats previously used by the U.S. Navy in World War II and the Korean War. </p><p>(The firefighting industry has long drawn from warfare both for its technological inspiration and metaphorical power. What were wildfires but hostile forces, forested lands but fields of battle? Today, dousing a fire with water is colloquially referred to as an \"aerial attack.\" As Ely wrote, \"Perhaps it is not surprising that the process of dropping bombs on people during World War II should have led some to think of dropping water bombs on forest fires.\") </p><p>At the turn of the 21st century, the Forest Service's fleet of converted military planes fell under intense scrutiny following a series          of fatal accidents. It was a pivotal moment, one that marked a shift away from the use of retired military aircraft in aerial firefighting and toward dedicated tankers converted from commercial planes and single-engine air tankers like the planes that Blois flies.       </p><p>Every pilot I spoke with stressed that aerial attacks represent only a fraction of the work it takes to put out a wildfire. In fact, the primary goal for an aerial firefighter isn't really to put out a fire, so much as to slow its spread so ground crews can          \"build line,\" or contain a fire along its border.        </p><p>INCREASINGLY INTENSE FIRES REPRESENT A CHALLENGE TO THE AERIAL FIREFIGHTING INDUSTRY. AS FIRES BECOME MORE COMPLEX, UNPREDICTABLE, AND DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS, HOW CAN THOSE TASKED TO FIGHT THEM KEEP UP? </p><p>\"Anytime there are large fires that happen, everybody sees the air tankers dropping retardant,\" says Paul Peterson, executive director of the United Aerial Firefighters Association, which formed in 2023 to advocate for safety and standardization in the booming aerial firefighting industry. \"Everybody thinks that's the biggest thing that's out there. Well, you know, ultimately any aircraft that is in the sky is supporting firefighters on the ground.\" </p><p>Today, most countries maintain a civil fire aviation program of their own. In the United States, the federal Forest Service maintains a varied fleet of aircraft, including single-engine air tankers with the capacity to hold up to 800 gallons of retardant; smokejumper aircraft, which are used to drop firefighters and cargo into critical areas via parachute; larger tankers like the DC-10, which can hold up to 8,000 gallons; and, of course, humble water scoopers like the AT-802F Fire Boss. Individual states can also have fire aviation programs of their own. California, most notably, boasts the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world, including airtankers, helicopters, pilots, and support staff stationed at 25 bases across the state. </p><p>Globally, there are also regional fleets like \"rescEU,\" a permanent, pan-European disaster response service, which is funded by the European Union and includes 28 firefighting aircraft. Then          there are private aviation companies, which supply the bulk of the planes and personnel used in aerial firefighting operations, usually on a contract basis with public agencies.        </p><p>Within this fragmented landscape, countries          and regions often share equipment and personnel through reciprocal-assistance agreements. \"Agencies around the world have typically relied on a process called mutual aid,\" says Jeff Berry, vice president of business development for Conair, an aerial-firefighting company with the largest private          fleet of aircraft in the world.       </p><p>Firefighting agencies in different parts of the globe often take advantage of each others' off-seasons to exchange equipment with one another when additional resources are needed. Operations send planes from Europe to Latin America or from North America to Australia as summer descends on the southern hemisphere, or vice versa. Agencies also move aircraft within the United States as regional fire risk changes with the seasons. </p><p>But in the past decade, difficult fire conditions have pushed resource sharing to the brink. \"You can easily double the amount of air tankers and helicopters that are out there and we might be close to what we need for right now,\" says Peterson. \"The fleet, over the last 20 years, has maybe increased by 10 to 15 percent. It has not increased at the size and scale of fires.\" </p><p>                                        ON MAY 22, 2015, THE WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT                              Branch of the Alberta Government called in a forest fire on the outskirts of Cold Lake, a small city on the province's eastern edge. The agency dispatched an initial fleet of firefighting aircraft, which arrived at the scene just after 3:30 p.m.        </p><p>At the top of the chain of command in a firefighting operation is an air-attack officer, who conducts an initial inspection of an affected area, leads a crew          of fire bombers in, and then directs the operation from overhead. This first set of air tankers-a Rockwell Turbo Commander, two Canadair CL-215T aircraft, and a Convair CV-580-quickly assembled into a choreographed loop circling around the fire. They took turns dropping water on its perimeter, with the CL-215Ts flying out to the nearby aptly named Burnt Lake, dipping in to reload with water.       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4c4ec921-2392-4d81-89a4-f03587411244\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>A tanker dumps retardant on the Mosquito Fire, which burned 76,788 acres in Placer County, California.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cold Lake fire began to spread quickly across the forest, its flames growing and lurching erratically. As it metastasized, the fire changed directions often and abruptly, a roaring beast to be tamed. </p><p>At 4:15 p.m. another fleet of tankers joined the circuit to do just that, including the plane \"Tanker 692,\" with Hilts at its helm. His Air Tractor AT-802A Fire Boss was a single-engine plane typically used in agriculture, reconfigured to hold and dump up to 800 gallons of water. </p><p>Hilts made his first water drop in the newly expanded circuit of planes. He made his second. Then, during his third loop, the plane ran into an invisible force. </p><p>Unbeknownst to the pilots circling overhead, a fire tornado had formed nearby, brought to life by a confluence of atmospheric conditions-mainly heat and unstable air-often present in cases of extreme wildfire. Aerial footage obtained from the Alberta government later indicated that the tornado, also known as a fire whirl, had been gathering in the vicinity of the air tankers as they made their drops. But it would have been impossible to detect. Tornadoes are made visible in large part because of the debris that they draw into their orbit. The fire whirl that day hadn't gathered enough strength yet to make itself seen. At 4:30 p.m. on that clear, crisp spring day, Hilts's Tanker 692 flew right into it. </p><p>THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND THE NATURE OF THE JOB CLASHED ON THAT DAY. </p><p>The violence of the whirl pitched the plane's nose down, then up, then down again. Next the plane entered a stall. Recovery from a stall requires planes to be at a certain level of altitude in order to correct their positioning and to reestablish airflow around the wings. Aerial firefighting requires planes to fly low to the ground. </p><p>The laws of physics and the nature of the job clashed on that day. The fire whirl pulled Hilts and his tanker toward the ground, before spinning away through a clearing in the forest and starting another fire.</p><p>Then it disappeared. </p><p>                                        FIRE WHIRLS ARE A RELATIVELY                              rare weather phenomenon. In fact, it wasn't until the advent of smartphones that they became widely documented.       </p><p>\"These large-scale fire tornadoes were kind of unknown back in the day,\" says Jason Forthofer, a firefighter and engineer at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, a research program run by the U.S. Forest Service. He first began looking into fire whirls while investigating the 2008 Indians Fire in California. \"It was almost firefighting folklore.\"</p><p>Forthofer studies fire behavior. Last year, he traveled to New Zealand, where he and a team of researchers attempted to generate fire whirls out in the field. The goal was to better understand how they form, and whether-if we understood them well enough-they might be something we could prepare for and protect ourselves against, like other weather events. The experiment worked. He and his colleagues became the first researchers to generate a fire whirl outside of a laboratory and are now analyzing the data.</p><p>According to Forthofer, fire whirls require two main ingredients: a rotating column of air and a force, like an updraft, that elongates it. When stretched, a vortex's diameter shrinks in size, Forthofer explains, much like how elastic materials like Play-Doh or taffy will thin when pulled apart. With a shrinking diameter, a vortex begins to spin faster and faster to conserve its own energy, and that acceleration creates dangerous whirls. (Fire whirls, tornadoes, and vortices are all used interchangeably to refer to tornadic events caused by extreme fire. Some scientists differentiate among them by size or behavior, but there's no unanimous definition for each term.)</p><p>Almost all fire whirls arise from extreme fire behavior, Forthofer explains. \"If we are moving into situations where we have more frequent high-intensity, extreme fire behavior, we should certainly see a higher frequency of these large fire tornado events,\" he says. \"We're probably having more of these fire tornadoes than we did 30 or 50 years ago,\" though data is sparse.</p><p>Wildfires can and do occur naturally, but climate change has severely distorted natural ecosystem patterns. In general, wildfire seasons are expanding in part due to earlier springs, longer summers, and warmer temperatures. Conditions like heat and drought increase fire frequency and severity. Loss of snowpack in mountainous regions means drier soils and vegetation. These conditions together make forests more flammable, more susceptible to a spark from a downed power line, a strike of lightning, or the flick of a cigarette.</p><p>\"From our perspective, I think we're seeing more violent fires, more mega fires, more of these          massive areas where we have to be flying for a long time just to go around the perimeter,\" says \u00c9der Navacerrada, an aerial firefighter based in Spain and the international operations lead pilot for Dauntless Air, an aerial firefighting company with a fleet of 17 AT-802F Fire Boss airplanes. Practically speaking, this might translate into more time spent in the air, more takeoffs and landings for planes to refuel. \"In the past, it was once every couple of years you get one of those big fires,\" he says. \"Now it's basically every season.\"       </p><p>Increasingly intense fires represent a challenge to the aerial firefighting industry. As fires become more complex, unpredictable, and downright dangerous, how can those tasked to fight them keep up? </p><p>                               IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE                               remaining air tankers working to put out the Cold Lake Fire ceased operations and returned to a nearby airport. Within a matter of minutes, emergency personnel had been dispatched to the scene of the crash to recover Hilts from the plane, which          lay right-side up in a gravel mining pit.        </p><p>The impact of the crash had punctured the plane's fuel tanks and sent gallons of fuel into the surrounding vegetation. As first responders worked to remove Hilts's body from the wreckage, flames crept toward them. At one point, the fire came so close they had to briefly evacuate. </p><p>Word of Hilts's accident soon spread through the tight-knit community of firefighters. </p><p>Blois was working on a mountainside in Whistler, British Columbia, thinning out trees in the forest to reduce fire risk, when he got the call with the news of Hilts's crash. His first reaction was disbelief. Hilts was one of the most level-headed pilots Blois had ever known, and it was unimaginable that he could lose his life doing what he did best. </p><p>For months, Blois's grief was a trance that he couldn't find his way through. His family convinced him to retire from aerial firefighting for good, and he didn't resist. He went back to freelance flying          gigs instead. There          was only one way he could get past the thicket of grief that had engulfed him since his best friend's accident: flying through it.       </p><p>He remembered                   the ad that he and Hilts had spotted about the museum looking for a pilot to ferry an old plane from Canada to Belgium. It was still open. He decided to go for it, enlisting a pilot and engineer friend named Taigh Ramey to help him do maintenance on the vintage plane and be his copilot for the journey. \"I thought to myself, 'I'm going to have to put everything else out of my          mind-my family,          Will's accident, everything,'\" Blois says. \"And that's what I did.\"       </p><p>Blois and Ramey          flew the plane seven hours a day for three consecutive days just to bring the aircraft from the West Coast of Canada to Labrador, near the easternmost point of North America-the voyage's halfway point. Then they took it across the Atlantic Ocean. \"Will was with me the whole time. It was the adventure that we'd talked about.\"        </p><p>Completing          the journey brought a sense of fulfillment, and felt like the closing of a chapter. It helped him draw a line in the passage of time, between mourning and acceptance. \"That was sort of the turning point for me,\" he says. \"We never really get over it. We just become less sad.\"       </p><p>         TODAY, THER                               E ARE EMERGING EFFORTS TO            make aerial firefighting safer in the face of heightened climate risks and worsening fire conditions, many of them aimed specifically at pilot training. After all, wildfires are dynamic, high-pressure environments to navigate. With enough practice, can the unpredictable be made predictable?                 </p><p>On a cool fall day, I drive out to the quiet town of Abbotsford, British Columbia, to get a firsthand look at Conair's training facilities. In 2016, the company conceived of a pioneering mission-training system, which uses immersive flight simulators to prepare pilots for complex wildfires. Today, that system is up and running. </p><p>Many aerial firefighters train on the same simulators commercial airline pilots use, which enable them to practice procedural moves, such as taking off and landing, and become familiar with a variety of conditions and hazards in a safe, controlled environment. However, until recently, few simulators replicated the unique risks of wildland fire: the smoke, the turbulence, the proximity to other aircraft. Like Blois, many aerial firefighters encountered these elements for the first time during a real firefighting mission. In the past decade, a slew of technological advancements have cropped up to integrate these conditions into          simulators themselves. (Hilts, who was employed by Conair at the time of the accident, had undergone both ground school and aircraft-specific type training, and had conducted a number of practice missions in the aircraft. A Conair spokesperson noted via email that the company has since updated its ground training to include a session that covers risks specific to the wildfire environment, including fire whirls, trains pilots to recognize shifting conditions in the field, and empowers them to refuse a mission when they feel the risk is too high.)       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"516767a1-fb80-4fbf-926a-6eb7fef46c59\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>Air tankers often work in tandem with firefighters on the ground.</p><p>Outside, the sky is gray as slate, wind whip         ping. Inside the training facility, it is dark and silent. Six replica plane cockpits-built to mimic some of the most widely used firefighting aircraft: a Dash 8-400, an RJ85, a C-208, a TC-690B, and two AT802s-are spread out around the room.          Each cockpit, replete with dozens of blinking dials, switches, knobs, laid out against illuminated panels, looks out toward a curved screen the size of a garage door. Playing on each enormous screen          is a virtual projection of verdant evergreen forest, as seen from a bird's-eye view. Suddenly, I had left the small farming community and entered the airspace above boreal wilderness.       </p><p>A Conair employee sits in the pilot seat of one of the cockpits and begins to navigate a virtual plane above          a fire. Smoke smudges the horizon, blurring the boundary between trees and sky.       </p><p>These simulated graphics are generated in part          by algorithms that account for factors like humidity, terrain, wind, fuel, and temperature. The flight-training devices can be linked together so that up to eight of the company's 90-plus pilots can practice on a complex wildfire at the same time.          While this program can't necessarily simulate extreme behavior like fire whirls, it still helps pilots to develop their skills in chaotic environments and practice difficult maneuvers.       </p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"e6a33cba-b7d2-401c-b3c2-d2b84bcd3de1\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"11705\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>Aerial firefighters have to contend with the influence of fire weather.</p><p>I know I am looking at a simulation, but my body can't fully register what my brain understands. The demo plane begins to turn. Accordingly, the simulated horizon begins to rotate quickly, becoming a nearly vertical line as the plane continues to tilt at a growing angle. I feel my most recent sip of coffee race back up my throat, and look away.</p><p>Conair's simulator is one of many recent developments in the world of wildfire training. The U.S. Forest Service is using a program called FS3D, a simulator developed by a contractor called Intel-lic Technologies, which also replicates wildfires based on real-life conditions. In the case of FS3D, the simulated environments are presented in virtu-al-reality headsets, allowing multiple firefighters to train together remotely. </p><p>Providing these training environments enables novice pilots to develop a deep understanding of the wildfire environment instead of relying predominantly on their intuition in the field, explains Walter Bunt, National Aerial Supervision Program Manager for the U.S. Forest Service. And the programs allow them to quickly and safely learn new skills in a short amount of time in an environment with a safety record of 100 percent, Bunt adds. In a wildfire simulator, \"nobody's gonna get hurt.\" </p><p>In one          effort to further minimize risk to human life, some are exploring potential ways to remove people from part of the aerial elements of wildfire          management. Unmanned aerial systems, more commonly known as drones, have increasingly been enlisted by local and federal agencies to spot and monitor fires, as well as to assess the devastation left in their wake.       </p><p>In 2007, NASA, in collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service, deployed an MQ-1, or Predator drone, to map the Zaca Fire in Santa Barbara, California. The drone, equipped with a thermal imager, pierced through a thick veil of smoke to reveal the fire's perimeter, which firefighters had trouble establishing. Then, in 2013, the U.S. Forest Service borrowed a drone from the California Air National Guard to help monitor the Rim Fire, which tore through the western edge of California's Yosemite National Park. </p><p>Drones have since provided multiple agencies the ability to continuously monitor a rapidly changing fire remotely. \"An unmanned aircraft like the MQ-1 probably isn't appropriate or needed on run-of-the-mill fires,\" Mike Wilkins, an incident commander in the 2013 Rim Fire, shared in a Forest Service report the following year. \"But on an extraordinarily large, fast-moving fire like the Rim Fire, it's pretty handy, when you have a concern about an area, to be able to get a look at the fire and what it's doing on a more frequent basis than one nighttime infrared flight.\" </p><p>While drones haven't yet extinguished wildfires, they are seeing more action in other ways. Some agencies like the U.S. Forest Service are using drones to ignite prescribed burns, a form of risk prevention, in which agencies start controlled fires to reduce risk of wildfire. </p><p>But technology can bring us only so close to understanding the mysteries of wildfire, whose most certain qualities are its consequences: property damage, risk to human life, ecosystem loss,          and, eventually, renewal. There are limits to how much we can predict about the infernos of the future, which will unfold under environmental conditions that exist today only as a spectrum of weighted probabilities, until time makes them known.       </p><p>                               TWO YEARS AFTER HILTS'S ACCIDENT, BLOIS                              began aerial firefighting again.        </p><p>He did it because he missed it. Because there was one time when his son asked him offhand why he didn't do it anymore, and Blois didn't have a response-not for his son, not for himself. Because he remembered why he initially took the job, how meaningful it had felt that first time, in a way that other flying assignments rarely did. \"Everything I do out there is immediately beneficial to my neighbors, to my friends, and my family,\" he says. </p><p>In June, Blois took off for Europe, where he's working another fire season in Greece. Affixed to his helmet is a sticker that he had custom made in honor of Hilts. It bears the tail number of Hilts's plane as well as the words \"Jackass Forever\" in cursive-a term of endearment the two shared, one Blois occasionally still hears in Hilts's voice in his head-underneath the wings of a blue swallow. </p><p>Traditionally, the bird represented luck and hope for sailors. Like the songbird, these sailors embarked on perilous journeys toward an unknown horizon; like the songbird, they hoped for a safe return.         e       </p><p>PHOTOGRAPH BY LONNIE WISHART; COURTESY FRAN\u00c7OIS LONGPR\u00c9;          ALAMY         ; JEN OSBORNE; GETTY IMAGES; CALIFORNIA AIR NATIONAL GUARD       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POPMCH-302441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POPMCH2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D36-NPH1-JBF3-R0DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Hearst Communications Inc.

(AP) \u2014 Fire crews in New Jersey have almost completely contained one major fire and are reporting good progress in battling another blaze that for a time threatened several dozen homes.</p><p>New Jersey Forest Fire Service officials said Saturday that the Flatiron wildfire blaze in Medford in Burlington County started just after midnight and was burning toward 40 homes before crews managed to move the blaze away from the structures.</p><p>Residents weren't evacuated but were protected within their homes, some using garden hoses to help as crews worked in the backyards to conduct backfires and burnout operations, officials said.</p><p>Saturday afternoon, officials reported \u201csignificant progress\u201d in fighting the fire; they said four structures still threatened were being protected by local fire crews. A structure set apart from the homes and described as some type of gazebo in the forest was earlier reported destroyed.</p><p>Officials also said the new blaze had burned about 180 acres (73 hectares) and was 60% contained. Officials earlier reported only 20% containment but said they hoped that would increase once the flames burned the rest of a 220-acre (89-hectare) containment area bordered by such things as roads, canals and streams.</p><p>Firefighters said the earlier fire burning in the Bass River State Forest, which stretches across Ocean and Burlington counties in the Pinelands, had been almost completely contained. The blaze, the largest in the state this year, had burned about 5,550 acres (2,246 hectares) since Wednesday.</p><p>About 40 people were evacuated as a precaution Thursday from a camping area and a long stretch of New Jersey\u2019s Garden State Parkway, the state\u2019s major north-south highway, was closed but was reopened Friday morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-ff99037f9c0e16595412300562359fdc20230603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68CN-6K51-DYMD-63M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"291\"/><timeReceived>8:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp; Local</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 3, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Spot Development</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>New Jersey</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Jersey forest fire homes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wildfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.S. news</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>General news</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDO</classCode><className>PRESS AGENCY RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N721211MM</classCode><className>RV PARKS &amp; CAMPGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The smoke and ash from the fire on Evia, a rugged island of forests and coves almost touching the Greek mainland, blocked out the sun, turning the sky orange as the blaze rampaged across the northern part of the island. The fire, which began Aug. 3, is the most severe of dozens that have broken out across Greece in the past week, after the country was baked by its worst heat wave in three decades, which sent temperatures soaring to 113 degrees Fahrenheit for days. </p><p>The heat, coming during a particularly hot summer, has turned Greece's forests, including large areas of easily flammable pine trees, into bone-dry tinderboxes. With roads on the island cut off by the flames, residents and tourists fled to Evia's beaches and jetties to be ferried to safety by a flotilla of ferries and boats organized by the coast guard. Some had harsh words for the country's firefighting efforts. \"We were completely forsaken. There were no fire brigades, there were no vehicles, nothing!\" David Angelou, who had been on Evia in the seaside village of Pefki, said last night after leaving the island by ferry to the mainland. \"You could feel the enormous heat; there was also a lot of smoke. You could see the sun, a red ball, and then nothing else around,\" he said. Other big wildfires have been burning forests and farmland in Greece's southern Peloponnese region, but a major blaze that encroached Athens' northern suburbs and the nearby Mount Parnitha national park was on the wane. Over the past week, hundreds of homes and businesses have been destroyed or damaged, and at least 40,000 hectares (nearly 100,000 acres) has been burned. Power cuts today affected at least 17,000 households. The causes of the blazes are undetermined, though several people have been arrested over allegations of arson. Greek media reported today the country's top prosecutor has ordered an investigation into whether the high number of fires could be linked to intentional criminal activity. The wildfires have stretched Greece's firefighting capabilities to the limit. More than 20 countries in Europe and the Mideast have responded to the country's call for help, sending planes, helicopters, vehicles and manpower. Today Greece's Foreign Ministry tweeted that neighboring Turkey - Greece's historic regional rival - will be sending two firefighting planes. It said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00c3\u00bct \u00c3\u2021avusoglu told his Greek counterpart the wildfires that raged for days through Turkey \"are now under control.\" The ministry also said Russia would be sending two firefighting planes and two helicopters. Greek authorities, scarred by a deadly wildfire in 2018 near Athens that killed more than 100 people, have emphasized saving lives, issuing dozens of evacuation orders. The coast guard said 2,770 people had been evacuated by sea across the country between July 31 and yesterday. But some residents and officials say the evacuations came too soon and they could have used the help of locals in saving villages. Some did stay, spraying homes with garden hoses and digging mini fire-breaks. \"The villagers themselves, with the firefighters, are doing what they can to save their own and neighboring villages,\" said Yiannis Katsikoyiannis, a volunteer from Crete who came to Evia to help his father save his horse farm near Avgaria. Today the flames raced across northern Evia, threatening yet more villages. Firefighters from Ukraine, Romania and Serbia were sent to the beleaguered island, where more than 600 firefighters were operating today, along with five helicopters and five water-dropping planes. One Greek volunteer firefighter died near Athens last week after being hit by a falling electricity pole, while four more were hospitalized in the capital, two in critical condition with extensive burns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017b2b1cd1e7a1fb3bdd704e0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63J8-S5G1-DY7N-F4B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 9, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

TechCrunch <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/spacexs-swarm-technologies-is-halting-new-device-sales/\">first reported</url> the news, and Swarm posted an <url normalizedValue=\"https://swarm.space/frequently-asked-questions/\">FAQ</url> on its website explaining that SpaceX's future direct-to-cell offering will support commercial off the shelf IoT applications. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Via Satellite</emphasis> reached out to a Swarm representative and was directed to the FAQ that confirms the end of new device sales. The company said it will still support current customers that use its M138 modem, which transmits and receives two-way data via its satellite network and can be embedded in third-party IoT devices. The FAQ said Swarm recently launched more satellites for the network on SpaceX's June 2023 rideshare mission, and is also manifested to launch more satellites for the network in 2024, indicating Swarm will continue supporting its customers. The update gave more insight into SpaceX's direct-to-cell plans for its Starlink network, which Elon Musk <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2022/08/25/elon-musk-announces-spacex-starlink-cellular-partnership-with-t-mobile/\">unveiled last year with T-Mobile</url>. SpaceX recently announced direct-to-cell partnerships with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2023/07/12/optus-plans-sat-to-cell-service-in-australia-with-starlink/\">Optus in Australia</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rogers-earnings-1.6823409\">Rogers Communications in Canada</url>. \"Swarm plans to offer a future LTE version of the M138 modem that is compatible with the Direct to Cell network - supporting the same form factor, command set, and Hive/API interfaces that customers have used with our VHF [very high frequency] product. There will also be options to instead purchase COTS modules you may already be using from third party vendors,\" the company said. Swarm is a SpaceX subsidiary and was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/business/2021/08/09/spacex-buys-out-satellite-iot-startup-swarm-technologies/\">acquired by SpaceX in 2021</url>. Swarm's co-founder and former CEO Sara Spangelo is now senior director of Satellite Engineering and co-lead for Direct to Cell at SpaceX, according to her LinkedIn. Last year, Spangelo said in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.satellitetoday.com/iiot/2022/08/09/swarm-founder-suggests-future-starlink-swarm-products-could-highlight-synergies-between-the-services/\">interview with</url> that there would be more synergy between Swarm and Starlink products in the future. At the time, Spangelo said Swarm had around 160 satellites in orbit and supported hundreds of customers in 15 countries, with 80% of the business being in agriculture and environmental monitoring. Swarm has supported customers like <url normalizedValue=\"https://interactive.satellitetoday.com/via/may-2023/from-wildfires-to-heavy-equipment-case-studies-for-satellite-iot/\">Dryad's early forest fire detection</url> and Rainforest Connection, which detects illegal logging by using IoT acoustic sensors placed in rainforests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SATTDY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SATTDY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VF-HN51-DYTC-03VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277894</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Access Intelligence, LLC.

I don't mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in place and protect lives and property. And for that, we cannot thank them enough,\" Cecil said.</p><p>The fire was primarily burning on federal, state and private property in Manchester Township, but it had jumped to the adjacent borough of Lakehurst.</p><p>Record heat will make fire conditions even worse</p><p>Summerlike temperatures are expected to last through Friday, with more than 25 potential high records falling.</p><p>\"We've been under high pressure the past couple of days. This is drying out the 'fuels' (dry brushland, dead leaves etc.). We should stay under high pressure for the next day,\" Cameron Wunderlin, National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN. \"Relative humidity drops very low with this flow around the high and all the ingredients are there for the fire weather concerns.\"</p><p>The record heat will only make fire conditions worse during the week, as temperatures soar into the mid-80s across New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast along the I-95 corridor.</p><p>Overnight temperatures will also remain high, which will create challenging conditions for firefighters. Nighttime temperatures will only drop to the low 60s or upper 50s, which won't allow for much recovery overnight.</p><p>\"Relative humidity is calculated by temperature and the amount of moisture,\" Wunderlin said. \"So if you have record highs and low humidity, the relative humidity will drop below the 30% threshold that we look for extreme fire behavior.\"</p><p>Places like New York City, New Brunswick,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>New Jersey, and even Philadelphia could break records Friday with temperatures expected to top out in the mid-80s.</p><p>Springfield, Massachusetts, could shatter its previous record of 77 by nearly 10 degrees if it hits the forecast high of 86 on Friday.</p><p>Winds will remain a factor as sustained winds are expected to stay around 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.</p><p>April is considered peak fire season for New Jersey. The state has seen other large fires in recent years, including one just last year that scored more than 13,000 acres. The fire in 2022 was roughly 50 miles from where the current fire is burning.         </p><p>CNN Meteorologist Monica Garrett, Jennifer Gray and Derek Van Dam and Kelly McCleary contributed to this report.         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

According to news reporting out of Athens, Greece, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Forest fires can result in loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and adverse environmental impacts.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Region of Attica. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National Observatory of Athens: \"This study showcases an integrated approach for conducting high-detail fire risk assessment and supporting strategic planning and management of fire events in peri-urban areas that are susceptible to forest fires. The presented methodology encompasses fire hazard modeling, vulnerability and exposure assessment, and in situ observations. Numerous fire hazard scenarios were tested, simulating the spatiotemporal spread of fire events under different wind characteristics. The vulnerability of the studied areas was assessed by combining population data (density and age) and building characteristics, while the exposure parameter employed land value (EUR/m2) as an indicator for qualitatively estimating potential economic effects in the study area. Field campaigns facilitated the identification and recording of critical areas and points, including high-risk buildings and population gathering areas, which subsequently informed the mitigation and fire management planning suggestions. Moreover, field recordings acted as an iterative process for validating and updating the fire risk maps.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research work utilizes state-of-the-art techniques to achieve an analysis of fire risk at a building-block level. Overall, the study presents an applied and end-to-end methodology for effectively addressing forest fire risk in peri-urban areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Geoinformatics and Machine Learning for Comprehensive Fire Risk Assessment and Management in Peri-Urban Environments: A Building-Block-Level Approach.
