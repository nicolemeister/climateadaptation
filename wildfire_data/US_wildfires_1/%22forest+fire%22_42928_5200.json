They've burned about 4.4 million hectares, roughly 17 times the annual average of the past decade, forced the evacuations of tens of thousands of people and led to poor air quality in major cities in Canada and the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And matters are expected to get worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The federal government has said warm and dry conditions are forecast to persist through to the end of the summer, leading to increased wildfire risk in most of Canada.</p><p>By 2050, the government projects the amount of forest burned by wildfire will double due to climate change, which is causing longer wildfire seasons, more extreme weather conditions and increased droughts.</p><p>Despite the alarming facts and figures, some experts say Canada is far more reactive than it is proactive when it comes to wildfires and they're pushing for a national campaign on wildfire education to better prepare for the future.</p><p>\"That would actually be at the very top of the list because we know people will act when given that guidance and it's the most bang for the buck you can possibly get by far,\" Blair Feltmate, head of the University of Waterloo's Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, told <url normalizedValue=\"http://CTVNews.ca\">CTVNews.ca</url>.</p><p>Ken McMullen, president of the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, said educating Canadians on how to stay protected from forest fires and prevent them would go a long way.</p><p>\"I'm fully supportive and I think the entire Canadian fire service is going to be supportive of any sort of preventative type measures that take place,\" he told <url normalizedValue=\"http://CTVNews.ca\">CTVNews.ca</url> in a phone interview.</p><p>\"When we think about a national campaign for the prevention and education of wildfires, it benefits all of us.\"</p><p>The \"biggest problem by far,\" Feltmate said, is that many Canadians do not understand the urgency with which they need to act to prevent and prepare for extreme flooding, extreme heat and wildfires.</p><p>\"The overwhelming limitation to forward movement and preparedness for climate change and extreme weather risk is a lack of sense of appreciation for the need to act with urgency,\" he said in a phone interview.</p><p>McMullen agreed.</p><p>\"The unfortunate reality is we're seeing more of them. Whether we want to learn, whether we want to be prepared, the circumstances are almost forcing us to learn quicker and more rapidly in response to these wildfires. There's still a lot to be done,\" he said.</p><p>But what would a national campaign on wildfire education entail?</p><p>McMullen said it would be beneficial to teach children from a young age in schools about what to do before, during and after a forest fire, complementing the existing fire prevention tips that they're being taught.</p><p>Meanwhile, he said all levels of governments should teach residents what being prepared in the event of a wildfire looks like, including having a 72-hour emergency kit and knowing what to do when your community goes on evacuation notice.</p><p>Some people don't grasp the dangers of wildfires until they're actually faced with them head on, he noted, such as in cities like Toronto and Ottawa that experienced poor air quality as a result of wildfire smoke that spread there from elsewhere in Ontario and Quebec.</p><p>He suggested knowledge sharing between provinces and territories, especially those that are used to seeing wildfires like Alberta and British Columbia, so that people across the country are more well equipped to deal with them.</p><p>\"As Canadians, we're probably more so on the (reactive) side and less on the proactive side,\" McMullen said.</p><p>\"And it's a bit of that notion of, 'It's not going to happen to me.' And what we're seeing in Canada right now with the amount of fires that are occurring, the size of those fires and the breadth for which they're spread across this country.\"</p><p>Canadians also need to learn how to protect themselves from the health impacts of wildfire smoke, said Dr. Joe Vipond, an emergency physician, co-founder of Masks for Canada and past president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment.</p><p>\"The worst component of that (smoke) is something called particulate matter 2.5-the small particles get into your lungs and into your bloodstream and have pretty significant health impacts,\" Vipond explained in a phone interview.</p><p>\"It's like essentially smoking cigarettes while you're outside.\"</p><p>Vipond said education should include what people should do when there's wildfire smoke, such as avoiding going outside when the air quality is poor, wearing a well-fitted mask-such as a K95 or N95 mask-if they have to be outdoors when it's smoky, using portable HEPA filters indoors and running a furnace fan with a high-quality furnace filter to clear out smoke from your home. </p><p>Teaching people about how climate change is linked to wildfires is important, too, Feltmate said, noting that many people don't understand or don't draw the connection.</p><p>\"Are elements of carelessness in society affecting the occurrences of these fires? The answer is yes. But superimposed on that is the fact that we have hot, dry conditions over extended periods of time that create the environment for the fires to be more severe in nature,\" he said.</p><p>Vipond echoed that remark. He said more action needs to be taken to stop the root causes of climate change, such as burning fossil fuels, which the United Nations says accounts for more than 75 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>\"This is incontrovertible evidence of an increasingly dangerous climate and this means that we are in an emergency and unless we stop ... burning fossil fuels, this is going to get worse and worse every year,\" Vipond said.</p><p>Natural Resources Canada told <url normalizedValue=\"http://CTVNews.ca\">CTVNews.ca</url> in an emailed statement the federal government is launching a Wildfire Resilient Futures Initiative.</p><p>The federal department said the initiative will enhance the FireSmart Canada program, build wildland fire knowledge through research, pilot and demonstration projects on fire risk reduction measures and establish a centre to help transform wildland fire management in Canada and internationally \"through innovation, knowledge exchange and supporting Indigenous fire stewardship.\"   </p><p>For now, McMullen encourages Canadians to follow the FireSmart program in order to protect their properties from wildland fires, prepare a 72-hour emergency kit and respect fire bans.</p><p>\"We cannot afford any more fires - We have simply run out of people. And we need all of you to quote unquote be volunteer firefighters and you can do that from the prevention side and not have fires begin in the first place.\"</p><p>The federal government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

Fire managers declared the KNP Complex 100 percent contained Thursday after significant precipitation in the Sierra Nevada, the National Park Service said Friday. The fire has not grown in recent weeks, but there has been continued activity in remote areas, the service said. The KNP Complex was ignited by a lightning storm on Sept. 9. Two fires that were spotted the next day eventually merged and scorched 138 square miles. The National Park Service said total containment means that the fire's perimeter is considered secure and no further growth is expected, which is different from a fire being declared out. \"Fire can become established in heavy fuels, such as large, downed trees, and may smolder there through multiple heavy snow and rain events, or even all winter, and become active again after the area dries out,\" the service said. The KNP Complex and another fire in the surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of the groves of giant sequoias in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, according to park officials.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017dd82edca7a1fdf93f205f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64JN-24R1-DY7N-F14N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 20, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NATIONAL PARK SERVICE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120MM</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; RECREATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLYR</classCode><className>PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

(\u201cMidland\u201d) (TSX-V:\u00a0MD) is pleased to announce that work will resume in the vicinity of the recent nickel-copper (\u201cNi-Cu\u201d) discovery named Santos. This zone was discovered during the maiden drilling program completed by Rio Tinto Exploration Canada Inc. (\u201cRTEC\u201d) on the T\u00eate Nord property. The upcoming drilling program will begin shortly to test new prospective geophysical targets located near Santos as well as further south in the vicinity of the Palmeiras and Savane showings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Located near the town of La Tuque, Quebec, the T\u00eate Nord property is currently wholly owned by Midland but is subject to an option agreement with RTEC since December 2021 (see press release by Midland dated December 2, 2021).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Commencement of a new drilling program with 6 drill holes totalling up to 1,900 metres;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Several new drilling targets identified in the Santos and Palmeiras areas, north of the former Lac Edouard Ni-Cu mine;</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>New drilling targets at Savane.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>New drilling targets at Santos and Palmeiras</p><p>Over the past few months, ground-based gravity surveys were completed in the vicinity of the new Santos Ni-Cu zone and further south along the same N-S-trending structure, in the vicinity of the Palmeiras showing. The gravity survey led to the identification of new prospective drilling targets, favourably located near the two showings. This new drilling campaign will consist of six (6) drill holes totalling up to 1,900 metres and is scheduled to begin in early July, depending on the forest fire situation in this part of the province of Quebec.</p><p>During the maiden drilling program, drill hole MDLD0015, designed to test a VTEM anomaly and an off-hole anomaly detected in drill hole MDLD0009, intersected from 14 metres to 80 metres downhole depth, several layers with Ni-Cu mineralization within altered gabbro horizons. From 20.11 to 22.79\u00a0metres, the drill hole intersected 1.10% Ni and 0.71% Cu over 2.68 metres. Further down, from 33.02 to 43.39 metres, a mineralized interval graded 0.45% Ni and 0.18% Cu over 10.37\u00a0metres (see press release by Midland dated April 27, 2023). Regionally, this new Santos zone is favourably located along a N-S-trending structure, approximately 8 km north of the former Lac Edouard Ni-Cu mine.</p><p>Modelling of the ground gravity survey completed this summer in the Santos area led to the identification of a new anomaly located a few hundred metres northwest of the Santos zone. A total of three (3) drill holes totalling up to 900 metres will be completed in the Santos area. Two of these drill holes will test possible extensions of the Santos zone to the south and west, and the third drill hole will be collared northwest of Santos to test the new gravity anomaly.</p><p>Approximately two kilometres south of Santos, along the same N-S-trending structure, a large gravity anomaly was detected immediately north of the Palmeiras showing, where mineralized Melagabbro to pyroxenite outcrops were identified near VTEM anomalies. One (1) drill hole totalling up to 300 metres is planned to test this new geophysical target.</p><p>Additional drilling on the Savane showing</p><p>A gravity survey was also completed in the Savane showing area. During the maiden drilling campaign, a mineralized interval intersected in drill hole MDLD0001 graded 1.07% Ni and 0.13% Cu over 0.78\u00a0metre, from 101.87 to 102.65 metres. Modelling of the gravity survey resulted in a better definition of the geometry of the mineralized intrusion at Savane and the identification of two lobes possibly representing previously unknown parts of the mineralized intrusion. Two (2) drill holes totalling up to 700 metres will be completed to test these intrusive targets.</p><p>In addition, prospecting work will be conducted approximately 750 metres northwest of the Savane showing, to explain the presence of a new gravity anomaly like the one associated with the mineralized intrusion at the Savane Ni-Cu showing.</p><p>About the T\u00eate Nord Ni-Cu property</p><p>The T\u00eate Nord property covers mafic and ultramafic rocks of the La Bostonnais Complex north of La Tuque, which hosts the former Lac Edouard mine that historically produced 50,000 tonnes of ore grading 1.50% Ni and 0.50% Cu (source: SIGEOM NTS sheet 31P09).</p><p>Cautionary statements:</p><p>Note that grab sample grades may not be representative of mineralized zones.</p><p>The true thickness of reported intervals cannot be determined with the information currently available; intervals are thus reported in core length.</p><p>Mineralization occurring at the former Lac Edouard mine is not necessarily indicative of mineralization that may be found on the T\u00eate Nord property held by Midland.</p><p>Quality Control</p><p>Drill core samples were sent to ALS Thunder Bay for preparation and ALS Vancouver for analysis. Samples were prepared according to the RIORCK package, where the entire sample is crushed to 70% passing less than 2\u00a0mm using a Boyd crusher-splitter combination, then 1\u00a0kg of material is pulverized to at least 85% passing 75 microns. This method includes between-sample washes on both crushers and pulverizers. Samples were analyzed for a full element suite using lithium borate fusion (ME-ICP06 and ME-MS81), with four-acid and aqua regia digestion (ME-MS61L and ME-MS41L), S and C by induction furnace (ME-IR08) and Au-Pt-Pd by ultralow detection 30\u00a0g fire assay (PGM-MS23L). The MDLD0015 batch of 114 samples included 8 certified reference materials (CRM) and 13 blanks, as well as 4 core duplicates for a quality control insertion rate of 28%. Reference materials consist of in-house standards CL-LG, CL-HG and EA-M, all independently prepared and certified. ALS included laboratory quality control using a range of blanks and CRM standards, and 16 RTX samples were analyzed twice as duplicates.</p><p>About Midland</p><p>Midland targets the excellent mineral potential of Quebec to make the discovery of new world-class deposits of gold and critical metals.

The stakes are much higher now.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump loves to perfume the air with empty boasts of his exceptional knowledge and experience in a wide range of subjects. Nobody understands campaign finance better than he, he's said. Or the business of TV ratings. Renewable energy. Debt. Trade. Infrastructure. The economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among Trump's many acts of empty braggadocio, one actually rings true. Nobody understands lawsuits and the courts the way he does, he says, and he can justify the claim. Trump has been a party to so many legal actions - both suing and being sued - that if he could convert all his court time into frequent flyer miles, he could make multiple voyages to the moon. Maybe even a round trip to Mars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former federal prosecutor James D. Zirin put the number of Trump-involved suits at 3,500, and rising, in his 2019 book Plaintiff in Chief: A Portrait of Donald Trump in 3,500 Lawsuits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"He sued for sport; he sued to achieve control; and he sued to make a point. He sued as a means of destroying or silencing those who crossed him,\" Zirin said in an interview.</p><p>But for all of Trump's time in the docket, his involvement in legal proceedings has all been of the civil variety. No longer. He's now facing two criminal prosecutions, a business records case in New York state, and the 37-count federal indictment filed against him Thursday alleging that he removed and retained classified documents when he left the White House. As Trump is about to learn, there's a big difference between a civil proceeding, which he knows intimately, and a criminal trial. It's like the difference between a flickering candle, which can raise a blister if you're not careful, and a forest fire, which can reduce you to ash. Trump's legal hubris, acquired in decades of civil litigation, has blinded him to the danger he is in. If he really knew courts as well as he claims, he would have done everything possible to avoid at least three more potential cases - for tax fraud, election meddling and interfering with the lawful transfer of power.</p><p>The criminal indictment of a former president who happens to be the leading Republican aspirant for the White House is unprecedented territory for the country. But it's perhaps more important that this is unfamiliar terrain for Trump as well, and he has not prepared properly for the ordeal.</p><p>The biggest practical difference between civil and criminal prosecutions is that remedies in civil cases are financial penalties or injunctions. This is the padded playroom in which Trump has cavorted his entire professional life. To Trump, lawyer fees, monetary punishments and court orders - when cases come to that - are just the costs of doing business. Trump's legal guru, Roy Cohn, taught him to draw out civil cases, wear the other side down, and never give in, a catechism that still guides him today. As Zirin puts it, Cohn taught Trump to counterattack; undermine his adversary; work the press; lie, lie and lie again; and even in the case of a loss or forced to settle, claim victory and go home.</p><p>But criminal cases don't pit one person or organization against another. They are reserved for crimes against the state or society, and the plaintiff isn't Joe or Doris or some regulatory body, it's the big, angry fist of government. When you lose in this venue, you don't write a check. You're often sentenced to prison. Trump has already invoked the Cohn rules in the federal indictment, accusing prosecutors of election interference and the Biden administration of judicial corruption. He's fund-raising off the indictment, too, and using it as a plank in his campaign platform. \"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you - I'm just standing in their way!\" reads the pinned message on his Truth Social account. But the Cohn rules, which can work so brilliantly in civil court, don't carry the same weight in criminal cases. Prosecutors seek justice, not compromise, and they're relatively immune to the field disturbances that rattle civil litigators. Did Trump's attorneys not tell him that?</p><p>They probably did. But remember, this is the guy who was told by an aide not to look into the sun during a solar eclipse, and he did it anyway. His lawyers have probably told him to shut up, too, but if so, he's already ignored that cardinal bit of defense advice. As he continues to attack the prosecution, will he divulge more potentially incriminating comments, as he did several times during the recent CNN town hall.</p><p>Of all the criminal proceedings and investigations against Trump, the one that would have been easy for him to avoid is the classified documents case. If, when contacted by authorities, he had simply returned the documents, he would have suffered not at all, like Joe Biden and Mike Pence, who quickly complied when their poor document hygiene became known. Trump's problem is that he would rather fight the law even when there is no reason to fight. He turned down multiple opportunities to return the docs. Instead, he prevaricated with a grin as if he were dodging some New York City building inspector. For his defiance, he might go to jail. According to the penalty sheet in the indictment, Trump faces 100 years if convicted on all 37 counts. That's not how it works, but it gives you a thumbnail of the peril he's in.</p><p>Inside his own bleached skull, Trump must now be imagining that he can run out the criminal clock too, just as he did in so many civil cases. His trial dates are months and months distant. It would be a legal miracle to try all the cases - both filed and prospective - before the 2024 election. He must figure he can retake the White House, which, depending on what the Supreme Court says, will give him leverage to postpone his trials. He might also believe that Ron DeSantis will pardon him, which DeSantis has not ruled out. (Presidential wannabe Vivek Ramaswamy has already committed to a pardon, so Trump has that going for him.) A self-pardon has never been tested, but Trump could theoretically take that route and negate federal convictions upon returning to the White House. But he'd still be on the hook for the state offenses, which are not pardonable by the president.</p><p>A normal person would not assume they could win all four or five (or however many) criminal cases. A normal person would never put all his eggs in the single basket that says, \"Win the White House, Get Out of Jail Free.\" A normal person would never count on DeSantis to deliver. And a normal person would never find himself in this pickle. But Donald Trump is not a normal person.</p><p>The Cohn rules have taught him lessons that seem to be pointing to his final undoing.</p><p>******</p><p>Trump fought the law. Will the law win?

That's according to a report[1] by Bloomberg. </p><p><br/> The judge overseeing the case said Dominion's request for internal performance reviews was both 'too intrusive' and 'about as personal as it gets.' Judge Eric Davis made the comments during a discovery hearing, Bloomberg wrote, but did not go into detail about the broader ramifications of the request. <br/> Per the Bloomberg retelling of the hearing, Dominion said it wanted the documents to 'bolster its claim that Fox maliciously booked former President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell to appear on its top-rated shows, where they spread false claims that the company rigged the 2020 presidential election.' <br/> 'These documents are relevant to Fox's oversight of its on-air personalities and Fox's knowledge of whether they were prone to lie and mis-inform the public on their shows,' Dominion said in a written document explained by Bloomberg in a separate pre-hearing report[2]. <br/> Judge Davis told FOX and Dominion to whittle down other evidence requests before dealing with the employment reviews, Bloomberg said. The issue may therefore come back in the future once other materials are handed over first. <br/> Bloomberg characterized the judge's attitude toward Dominion's request for the personnel files as one of 'skepticism.' However, it reported that the judge 'spent much of the hearing criticizing the network for wildly asserting attorney client privilege to avoid disclosing other information.' Some of that information included whether \u2014 and, if so, the extent of \u2014 any joint defense agreements with the Powell, Giuliani, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. <br/> 'The existence of a joint defense agreement is not privileged,' Davis said, again according to Bloomberg. 'We all know that's not true.' <br/> The judge seemed inclined to allow Dominion to obtain information about advertising deals between Lindell and FOX \u2014 thus suggesting a possible economic motive for the conservative news organization to give Lindell air time in editorial time slots. <br/> According to multiple[3] reports[4], Lindell yanked his advertisements[5] from FOX programming[6] but returned recently. However, he then bizarrely claimed[7] on a podcast with Steve Bannon that FOX and Dominion cooked up the billion-dollar litigation[8] in a weird scheme to eject Lou Dobbs from the FOX programming lineup. <br/> FOX has argued that much of the data Dominion seeks is protected by attorney-client privilege. Judge Davis said that Lindell is not FOX's client. <br/>Dominion sued FOX in late March[9] for allegedly turning a 'small flame' into a 'forest fire' of election conspiracy theories. <br/> 'As the dominant media company[10] among those viewers dissatisfied with the election results, Fox gave these fictions a prominence they otherwise would never have achieved,' Dominion's attorneys wrote[11] in a 138-page complaint. <br/> FOX has more broadly sought to scuttle the Dominion lawsuit[12] on First Amendment grounds. It has long argued that its broadcasts are protected free speech on an important issue raised by the then-president himself \u2014 and one it says required full public debate. <br/> [Photo by Chip

First of all, I would like us to speak about the forest fires. The situation is quite complex in some regions of Siberia and the Russian Far East. In some regions a state of emergency has been introduced.</p><p>Ms Abramchenko, we would like you to tell us what is being done to deal with this pressing problem.</p><p>Viktoria Abramchenko : Mr Mishustin, unfortunately, the situation regarding forest fires is rather complex. Due to an unusually warm winter and an early and dry spring, the fire season has begun much sooner than usual this year. The first forest fires were reported already in January. For the first time in the history of satellite monitoring, we registered a forest fire inside the Arctic Circle.</p><p>Already in April, the weather in many parts of the Siberian and Urals federal districts, as well as in the Volga Region, was unusually hot and windy, and thunderstorms have had an adverse effect as well. This year, forest fires have consumed an area of 1.2 million hectares. There have been more than 9,000 forest fires. At the same time, the area of forest fires this year was 25 percent less than in the same period of the preceding year. The Far Eastern Federal District was hit the hardest. It accounts for some 80 percent of forest fires this year.</p><p>As of today, we are working to put out 155 fires with an aggregate area of 33,000 hectares in 19 Russian regions. The efforts involve 5,500 firefighters and approximately 900 pieces of equipment, including aircraft, 66 of which are monitoring the situation and 31 are putting out the fires. The interregional efforts include 681 members of the airborne service of the Avialesokhrana forest fire monitoring agency and regional forest fire air bases. These efforts are being taken in the hardest hit regions of Russia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123830329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D6-78H1-JCBF-S18F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DFTB</classCode><className>STATES OF EMERGENCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DSH8</classCode><className>MIKHAIL MISHUSTIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX266</classCode><className>MOSCOW, RUSSIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009WRP</classCode><className>ARCTIC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Air with hazardous levels of pollution extended into the New York metropolitan area, central New York state and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as North Carolina and Indiana, affecting millions of people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI can taste the air,\u201d Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, New York, which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.</p><p>The air quality index, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency metric for air pollution, exceeded a staggering 400 at times in Syracuse, New York City and Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley. A level of 50 or under is considered good; anything over 300 is considered \u201chazardous,\u201d when even healthy people are advised to curtail outdoor physical activity.</p><p>In Baltimore, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Fort McHenry, a national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI walked outside this morning, and it was like a waft of smoke,\u201d said Funk.</p><p>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.</p><p>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been lapping into the U.S. since last month but intensified with recent fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control Wednesday \u2014 which, unsettlingly, was national Clean Air Day in Canada.</p><p>The smoke was so thick in downtown Ottawa, Canada's capital, that office towers just across the Ottawa River were barely visible. In Toronto, Yili Ma said her hiking plans were canceled and she was forgoing restaurant patios, a beloved Canadian summer tradition.</p><p>\u201cI put my mask away for over a year, and now I\u2019m putting on my mask since yesterday,\" the 31-year-old lamented.</p><p>Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said the province currently has the capacity to fight about 40 fires \u2014 and the usual reinforcements from other provinces have been strained by conflagrations in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-wildfires-halifax-rain-fb4a05893fc375ecc1f0db9f37ce18dd\">Nova Scotia</url> and elsewhere.</p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more are due soon.</p><p>In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. His administration has contacted some U.S. governors and local officials about providing assistance, she said.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter that he spoke by phone with Biden and \u201cthanked him for all the help Americans are providing as we continue to fight these devastating wildfires.\u201d</p><p>The largest town in Northern Quebec \u2014 Chibougamau, population about 7,500 \u2014 was evacuated Tuesday, and Legault said the roughly 4,000 residents of the northern Cree town of Mistissini would likely have to leave Wednesday. But later in the day, Mistissini Chief Michael Petawabano said his community remains safe and asked residents to wait for instructions from Cree officials.</p><p>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense.</p><p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he said.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said 1 million N95 masks would be available at state facilities. New York City closed beaches, and Mayor Eric Adams told residents to stay indoors as much as possible as smoke smudged out the skyline. Zoos in the Bronx and Central Park closed early and brought their animals inside.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty and Philadelphia because the smoke was limiting visibility. It also contributed to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where a heavy haze shrouded the Washington Monument and forced the cancellation of outdoor tours.</p><p>Major League Baseball put off games in New York and Philadelphia, and even an indoor WNBA game in Brooklyn was called off.</p><p>On Broadway, \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star Jodie Comer had difficulty breathing and left the matinee of \u201cPrima Facie\u201d after 10 minutes; the show restarted with an understudy, show publicists said. \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cCamelot\u201d canceled Wednesday evening performances, with \u201cHamilton\u201d publicists saying the the deteriorating air quality \u201cmade it impossible for a number of our artists to perform.\u201d In Central Park, the popular outdoor Shakespeare in the Park performances were put off through Friday.</p><p>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K, advised participants to adjust their plans according to air quality.</p><p>New Jersey closed state offices early, and some political demonstrations in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were moved indoors or postponed. Striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area.</p><p>The smoke exacerbated health problems for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis.</p><p>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Burnett said, \u201cI came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed.\u201d</p><p>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, and I\u2019m having some problems for it, but there should be help for them,\u201d she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Gillies reported from Toronto.

(Oct. 21, 2022) - October is Fire Prevention Month in the City of Oak Ridge.</p><p>Mayor Warren Gooch issued the proclamation for Fire Prevention Month on Sept. 30, 2022, which states that all citizens be encouraged to practice fire prevention and safety by checking their smoke alarms and designing a home escape plan.</p><p>The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 killed more than 250 people, left 100,000 homeless, destroyed more than 17,400 structures and burned more than 2,000 acres. At the same time, the Peshtigo Fire also roared through Northeast Wisconsin, burning down 16 towns, killing 1,152 people and scorching 1.2 million acres, making it the most devastating forest fire in American history.</p><p>Both blazes produced countless tales of bravery and heroism and changed the way firefighters and public officials thought about fire safety.</p><p>On the 40th anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire, the Fire Marshals Association of North America (today known as the International Fire Marshals Association) decided that the anniversary should be observed in a way that would keep the public informed about the importance of fire prevention.</p><p>In 1920, President Woodrow Wilson issued the first National Fire Prevention proclamation, and the President of the United States has signed a proclamation proclaiming a national observance every year since 1925, making it the longest running public health and safety observance on record.</p><p>The Oak Ridge Fire Department provides in-home assistance with smoke alarm installation and home escape planning year-round. In October, educational programs are conducted within our school system to increase awareness of the importance of fire prevention and safety.</p><p>\"Each elementary school receives an assembly and outside activities. The assembly is about one hour in length, and this year our program is Fire Prevention Family Feud,\" Capt. Austin Keathley said. \"The game show features students as the contestants trying to guess important fire prevention topics.\"</p><p>Younger students have the opportunity to speak to a firefighter and see the firefighter put gear on.</p><p>\"Putting on the gear is an attempt to help young children not be afraid of firefighters,\" Keathley said. \"In situations that firefighters are needed, fear is already present, and we hope to ease that with having children become familiar with the look and sounds they could hear or see.\"</p><p>They cover topics like stop, drop and roll, home escape plans, and crawling low under smoke. Of course, the main attraction is always the opportunity to look at and get in the fire truck.</p><p>The programs are designed to best fit grades Pre-K through 4th grade. ORFD also visits the Oak Ridge Schools Preschool and St. Mary's School.</p><p>To learn how to create a home escape plan, visit the National Fire Protection Association's website at NFPA.org.</p><p>As a reminder, you can contact the Oak Ridge Fire Department year-round for a free smoke alarm or inspection of your current smoke alarms at 865-425-FIRE (3473).

This includes the Upper and Lower Timberline, Goat Rocks and Riverdance neighborhoods, and parts of High Valley. The fire expanded by several hundred acres over the weekend due to dry, windy conditions, which prompted the precautionary evacuation warnings. Packwood proper is not under evacuation status at this time.</p><p>By Saturday night, flames from the forest fire were visible from the downtown area. The East Lewis County town is laden with thick smoke and all around Washington, several air quality alerts are in place. On Wednesday, The Seattle Times reported Seattle was experiencing some of the worst air quality in the world.</p><p>Wednesday was expected to be the last day of warm, fire-friendly weather, according to a news release from staff working on the Goat Rocks Fire. On Thursday, an onshore flow was set to bring cooler, more humid air into the region as a series of weather systems were forecast to bring rain and cooler temperatures starting Friday.</p><p>There are over 200 people working on the fire in east county, which was started by lightening in early August. There are several helicopters and fire engines in use and crews are patrolling neighborhoods several times per day.</p><p>One helicopter was able to drop water on the fire for a short period in the afternoon on Tuesday despite heavy smoke making flying difficult.</p><p>According to a news release, as the helicopter was returning to its base, a drone was spotted near the fire. Flying drones near wildfires is a violation of federal law.</p><p>\"(Drone) incursions are very dangerous for aircraft working on the fire. Pilots may not see an (unmanned aerial system) in time to avoid a collision, which may damage an aircraft and possibly cause a crash. A UAS too close to a fire requires a shut-down of ALL aerial operations,\" the release stated.</p><p>One Packwood resident told The Chronicle Sunday she felt \"just so thankful for the firefighters.\" She mentioned their consistent, friendly and cooperative presence in the community, which has been dealing with significant effects of the fire and its smoke since the blaze first engulfed hundreds of acres in early September.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters on the Kalama Fire south of Mount St. Helens continue to take advantage of minimal fire activity and are making progress on suppression, according to a news release from the U.S. Forest Service. The size of that fire remains at approximately 495 acres with containment at 37%. When aircraft at the Goat Rocks Fire were grounded during heavy smoke over the weekend, those teams were assisting with Kalama Fire efforts.</p><p>To get the most up to date information on evacuations throughout Lewis County, sign up for Lewis County Alerts at <url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/LewisCountyAlerts\">https://bit.ly/LewisCountyAlerts</url>.</p><p>For more information on the Goat Rocks Fire, call 360-370-4168 between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. or email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:2022.GoatRocks@firenet.gov\">2022.GoatRocks@firenet.gov</email></p><p>___ (c)2022 The Chronicle (Centralia, Wash.)

And there's little the government can do about it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The primary cause: smoke wafting downwind from more than 150 wildfires burning in Quebec Province, Canada, with no immediate respite in sight. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plume \"is about as widespread as I've ever seen it,\" said Paul Miller, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a Boston-based group of air pollution regulators from many of the states most directly affected. The episode ranks among the worst on record for the eastern U.S., EPA data indicates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's also the latest manifestation of a trend that those regulators are effectively helpless to confront in the short term: bigger and longer-lasting wildfires linked to the effects of climate change. While those blazes are already catastrophically common in California and other Western states, hotter and drier conditions in eastern forests are now facilitating their spread in that part of the country as well. </p><p>And short of solving climate change, there's not much for federal regulators to do about it. </p><p>\"We're going to see more fire risk,\" said Jessica McCarty, director of the Geospatial Analysis Center at Miami University in Ohio and a NASA researcher in atmospheric smoke, told a House committee two years ago. Absent any way to stop the plume's spread, state and local agencies could only warn residents to avoid it.</p><p>From the normally pristine Adirondack Mountains in New York state to central North Carolina, rural and urban areas alike suffered from soot levels that EPA rated as either unhealthy or very unhealthy. As of midmorning Wednesday, Detroit and New York City ranked second and third, respectively, among the world's metro areas with the worst air quality, according to the Swiss firm IQAir.</p><p>Poor visibility from the smoke also caused cascading delays for flights in and around New York City on Wednesday afternoon, some lasting up to an hour. The Federal Aviation Administration briefly halted arriving flights at New York's LaGuardia Airport and has slowed departures at airports around the city, the agency said.</p><p>\"The agency will continue to adjust the volume of traffic to account for the rapidly changing conditions,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>\"I know for many communities out West this is nothing new. They experience this every year, but it is certainly getting worse. It is yet another alarming example of the ways in which the climate crisis is disturbing our lives and our communities,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>President Joe Biden is in touch with the Canadian government, and the U.S. has deployed more than 600 U.S. firefighters and personnel, along with \"water bombers\" and other firefighting equipment, Jean-Pierre said.</p><p>Under the Clean Air Act, EPA regulates soot by setting air quality standards, which the agency is in the midst of strengthening. But those standards are designed to control soot exposure from industrial plants, vehicles and other human sources. They make no provision for the impact of wildfire smoke.</p><p>EPA's daily exposure standard is 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. </p><p>Soot levels in Syracuse, N.Y., topped 400 micrograms, NASA scientist Ryan Stauffer wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. \"Unprecedented does not begin to describe this event,\" Stauffer wrote. </p><p>In Washington, EPA estimated soot concentrations at 194 micrograms.</p><p>For regulatory purposes, EPA continues to consider wildfire-related pollution as an \"exceptional event\" that doesn't count against an area's compliance status. In the course of the review of the current soot standards, an EPA advisory panel last year recommended that agency officials \"consider the implications\" of that traditional approach. </p><p>In a draft rule released in January, EPA staffers agreed that forest blazes are a challenge to implementing ambient air quality standards, but punted on offering any alternative to the status quo.</p><p>In Washington, where soot levels were more than five times EPA's daily exposure standard, public school leaders Wednesday canceled recess, athletic practices and all other outdoor activities.</p><p>On Twitter, New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged residents with heart or breathing problems to \"try to limit your outdoor activities today to the absolute necessities.\" </p><p>\"Everyone should limit their exposure by staying indoors and closing windows, especially those with risk factors,\" the Maryland Department of the Environment wrote in a website alert. </p><p>But for construction workers and others who don't have the option of staying inside, the crisis left them exposed to extraordinarily high levels of smoke, a mashup of harmful compounds that include hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, according to an EPA guide. </p><p>Most perilous are the tiny bits of particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and even leach into the bloodstream.</p><p>Commonly dubbed soot, those fine particles are technically known as PM2.5 because they are no bigger than 2.5 microns in diameter, or one-thirtieth the width of a human hair. They are linked to a wide variety of respiratory and cardiovascular ills, including worsened breathing problems, higher risk of stroke and non-fatal heart attacks, and increased odds of premature deaths in some circumstances.</p><p>Dr. Susie O'Mara, chair of emergency medicine at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said there could be an uptick in hospital or emergency room visits in coming days as people begin to experience more severe symptoms.</p><p>\"What we worry about is that we're not seeing it today, but we'll start seeing it tomorrow or the next day when people are actually in quite a bit of trouble,\" O'Mara said.</p><p>She said the change in air quality can impact asthmatic or nonasthmatic people and could trigger early symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath or runny nose. She urged people to take preventative measures now, particularly if they have a chronic medical condition.</p><p>Canadian smoke plumes could continue rolling into the U.S. for at least a few more days: As of Tuesday, there were 426 active wildfires across all of Canada, with more than half categorized as \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>\"There are fires going on all over the place almost all the time,\" said Miller of the Boston-based air regulatory consortium. </p><p>Recalling the groundswell of public support that led to passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act, Miller noted that many Americans have no experience with the pollution levels common in the 1960s. The increasing frequency of large wildfires - and highly visible wildfire smoke - raises the possibility of a similar support for action on climate change, he said.</p><p>\"The point is that people tend to act on things they can see.\"</p><p>Reporters Rebekah Alvey, Robin Bravender and Danielle Muoio Dunn contributed to this report.</p><p>A version of this report first ran in E&amp;E News' Greenwire.

These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response.</p><p>Today, the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at local and regional airports in British Columbia.</p><p>Through Transport Canada's Airports Capital Assistance Program, eight airports in British Columbia will receive over $14 million from the Government of Canada for projects and equipment that will help maintain safe airport operations for passengers, crews, and airport workers. The airports receiving funding are:</p><p>* * *</p><p>Cranbrook</p><p>* $1,610,312 to rehabilitate airfield electrical systems</p><p>* $336,525 to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck</p><p>* * *</p><p>Fort St. John</p><p>* $217,360 to purchase a sweeper</p><p>* * *</p><p>Masset</p><p>* $448,700 to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck</p><p>* $428,905 to purchase a loader with attachments</p><p>* * *</p><p>Nanaimo</p><p>* $224,350 to purchase a 4x4 snowplow truck</p><p>* * *</p><p>Powell River</p><p>* $8,025,527 to rehabilitate Runway 09-27</p><p>* * *</p><p>Terrace</p><p>* $299,452 to construct a mobile equipment shelter</p><p>* $217,360 to purchase a sweeper</p><p>* * *</p><p>Tofino</p><p>* $2,333,104 to replace wildlife control fencing</p><p>* $261,751 to construct a sand and equipment shelter</p><p>* * *</p><p>Williams Lake</p><p>* $502,200 to purchase a medium-sized snowblower</p><p>This funding is in addition to the more than $61 million provided under the Program in 2021 to support safety-related projects at the Castlegar, Fort Nelson, Fort St. John, Kamloops, Masset, Nanaimo, Powell River, Prince George, Qualicum Beach, Quesnel, Smithers and Terrace airports.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Quotes</p><p>\"Airports play a crucial role to keeping Canadians connected across our vast country, and the last two years have only underscored this. Today's investment of over $14 million in eight airports across British Columbia is great news for the region's air sector and for all the communities these airports serve.

They are rare in Northern New England, making them ripe for a bit of scaremongering by the Climate Cult. What if, oh noes and Climate Change! How much longer will we be safe from the scourge? What scourge? </p><p><br/>The timing is good. It's going to be unseasonably warm this weekend. And there is never a wrong time to talk about wilderness and fire safety. A little breeze and an unattended fire can ruin a neighborhood surrounded by trees, and we've got more of those than not. But everything is green and wet in the spring. <br/>It's 40 or 80, but it has also been rainy. Wet and green do not wildfires make, but the 'dry' season is creeping up on us (the fearmongering drought season - we have it every year), and not everyone is wet at the same time, so wildfires[2] happen. The question is spin versus reality. <br/>If you'd like a recent example, Climate Realism dissected a Market Watch scare-piece about burning in the Southwest that's worth a read[3], and another here on Yahoo! news doing the same thing[4]. <br/>Related: US Forest Fire Data Tampering - They Dissapeared 57-Years of Inconvenient Truth[5]. <br/>The central planners are forever pointing at local events to justify global action, but there's a problem. When it comes to burning average nationally or even globally, you'd be right to ask, where's the fire[6]? <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/US-fires-and-acres-burned.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/US-fires-and-acres-burned.png</url><br/><br/>The slight uptick in the past decade, as we're reported elsewhere, is probably a result of arson by environmentalists. Climate warriors, not the climate. Activists acting like those so-called victims of hate crimes we later discover were the perps themselves. Always to get pity or to promote an idea they are so certain is true that they have to commit the crime to make it so. <br/>Related: CO2 Increases 'Linked to' Rising Education Costs and More Gun Crimes in Democrat Cities but not Forest Fires.[7] <br/>The other culprit, domestically, is the result of environmental policy. Blocking efforts to clear fuel from the forest floor account for many fires and lost acreage (and often like) in places like California. Simple forest management would prevent fires or save average[8], but that's not what they need, so the people blaming the climate for fires want to see it burn. <br/>Globally, the burn average is also down in the past century, not justa little[9]. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GLobal-Burned-area-by-decade.png\">https://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GLobal-Burned-area-by-decade.png</url><br/>Add the rising global CO2 trend line, and there is NO connection between the Climate Cult's darkhorse and wildfires nationally or globally. But that's no excuse not to cling to their climate bibles and global warming guns, and they refuse to see the forest for the trees. <br/>It has to be man-made climate change, or their entire faith system collapses. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The post Here We Go Again: No, Forest Fires are Not Getting More Likely or More Frequent[10] appeared first on Granite Grok[11]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/?s=wildfires\">https://granitegrok.com/?s=wildfires</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/?s=wildfires\">https://granitegrok.com/?s=wildfires</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climaterealism.com/2022/05/misleading-headline-aside-market-watch-reveals-some-wildfire-truths/\">https://climaterealism.com/2022/05/misleading-headline-aside-market-watch-reveals-some-wildfire-truths/</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climaterealism.com/2022/05/yahoo-news-misleads-on-new-mexico-wildfires/\">https://climaterealism.com/2022/05/yahoo-news-misleads-on-new-mexico-wildfires/</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/05/us-forest-fire-data-tampering-they-dissapeared-57-years-of-inconvenient-truth</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateataglance.com/climate-at-a-glance-u-s-wildfires\">https://climateataglance.com/climate-at-a-glance-u-s-wildfires</url>/ [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2020/09/wildfires-result-of-systemic-democrat-incompetence-not-co2-or-your-modern-lifestyle\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2020/09/wildfires-result-of-systemic-democrat-incompetence-not-co2-or-your-modern-lifestyle</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/06/california-maybe-if-we-clean-up-the-forests-like-trump-said-well-have-fewer-wildfires\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2021/06/california-maybe-if-we-clean-up-the-forests-like-trump-said-well-have-fewer-wildfires</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-of-fire\">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145421/building-a-long-term-record-of-fire</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com/blog/2022/05/here-we-go-again-no-forest-fires-are-not-getting-more-likley-nor-more-frequent\">https://granitegrok.com/blog/2022/05/here-we-go-again-no-forest-fires-are-not-getting-more-likley-nor-more-frequent</url> [ 11]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://granitegrok.com\">https://granitegrok.com</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Reports from every section of the county are to the effect that a water shortage exists, and in some localities it is causing apprehension. Springs and wells have gone dry, streams have ceased to flow, and creeks have become mere brooks. The Monocacy and Potomac rivers are so low that both can be crossed in places by stepping from one stone to another above the surface of the water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The most violent wind storm of the year swept through Frederick valley Friday afternoon and evening, blowing down fodder stacks and demolishing fencing. In some sections of the valley, the storm resembled a hurricane. Farmers in the vicinity of Creagerstown found their fodder scattered everywhere. Lower sections of the valley made similar reports. In the wake of the windstorm came the first countywide snow flurry of the season. Snow was still lying on the ground at Braddock Heights and at other sections at a late hour Friday night.</p><p>After raging for more than fourteen hours and burning over approximately 1,500 acres of land, the forest fire on the Frederick county side of Catoctin mountain had practically burned itself out by 4 o'clock Friday afternoon. About one hundred men and boys, under the direction of the two deputy wardens, fought the flames all night and practically all of the following day.</p><p>Frank C. Hargett has leased for a period of years 17 acres of land, lying along the eastern slope of Catoctin mountain, at Braddock Heights, from Charles Wertheimer, which he will take possession April 1 and convert into a flower farm cultivating on an extensive scale dahlias, peonies, gladiolas, roses and chrysanthemums. The site is situated between the state highway and the Hagerstown and Frederick trolley road, and will be improved with an avenue leading from the road to the trolley line, where a station will be built.</p><p>40 Years Ago</p><p>Nov. 25, 1982</p><p>This date was Thanksgiving. The Frederick News-Post did not publish a holiday edition at this time.</p><p>(Editor's Note: The News-Post does not have access to archives from 50 years ago for August 1972 through March 1973. The \"50 Years Ago\" summary will return April 1, 2023.)</p><p>20 Years Ago</p><p>Nov. 25, 2002</p><p>Tina Jackson blinked back tears Sunday as she thanked Habitat for Humanity and those who helped build her new home for giving her family a place to love. Members of Habitat for Humanity of Frederick County and the Frederick Regional Council of Episcopal Churches, which pooled the efforts of nine area Episcopal churches in building Ms. Jackson's single-family house in Adamstown, gathered for a dedication service outside the home Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Jackson qualified as the future homeowner for Habitat's 19th home built in Frederick.</p><p>Dairy farms may be more vulnerable than other farms to urban change, but population growth also brings more opportunities that can help farmers, said Ralph Heimlich, the deputy director for analysis at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. \"Niche markets open up. Farmers can start selling their product to restaurants, though for the dairy farmer it's harder to do because of health restrictions,\" he said.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Frederick News-Post (Frederick, Md.)

About 44% of those fires were human caused. Air quality ratings statewide mainly stayed between \"moderate\" and \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\"</p><p>On the Flathead National Forest, there were 47 fire starts in 2022 and 10,871 acres burned, according to Rick Connell, a fire management officer who focuses on the Flathead National Forest. This is an increase in damage compared to 2021 and 2020, where 3,754 acres and 5,428 acres burned, respectively. According to Connell, the past five years have consistently been average or below average seasons.</p><p>One notable fire in 2022 near Flathead County was the Elmo Fire west of Flathead Lake, which was detected July 29 and burned 21,349 acres. Although local volunteer fire departments and the Missoula Smokejumpers responded quickly, the fire grew significantly in the first few hours. High temperatures and strong winds pushed the fire north and east, requiring evacuations. Eight structures were lost, including four primary residences.</p><p>Overall, this year's fire season was \"relatively small,\" according to Julia Berkey, the community preparedness and wildlife prevention program manager at the DNRC. Spring rains lasted longer, helping to prevent a bigger season.</p><p>Experts generally attribute the increase in fire intensity over recent years to climate change, Connell said, but he added that forest fire has cycled through phases since the beginning of time.</p><p>In the Flathead area, according to a data set curated by Connell, 1,233,000 acres burned from 1889-1930. However, only 40,000 acres burned between 1930 and 1979. From 1980-2018, an increase was seen again: 1,076,716 acres.</p><p>Nationally, there has been an increase in wildland fire intensity in the past few decades. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, nearly 7.5 million acres burned in 2022 across the U.S., which is above the 10-year average.</p><p>In the context of larger trends and the absence of reliable, historic fire data, however, it is hard to attribute the increase in wildfires to global warming alone.  To many firefighters and experts, wildfire is a natural recycler.</p><p>\"Fires have always been in the landscape here and they always will be,\" said Lincoln Chute, the Flathead County fire warden. Vegetation in the Flathead Valley has grown up and adapted with fire as a disturbance.</p><p>\"If there was nobody here, there would still be fire,\" Connell said.</p><p>At the end of December, DNRC reported having spent just over $16 million on fire suppression. DNRC had a $54 million budget for fire suppression at the beginning of the fiscal year, which began on July 1.</p><p>In 2022, total fire costs in Montana finished at over $52 million. The upcoming legislative session this next January will determine the agency's 2023 wildlife budget.</p><p>At the beginning of the season, Gov. Greg Gianforte said he would prioritize an aggressive initial suppression strategy, stating that Montana would not let fires burn. Gianforte also increased the base hourly pay rate for seasonal firefighters by $1.70 to $15.50. The DNRC is currently in a hiring phase, ensuring that staff is ready for next season.</p><p>As for what 2023 will bring, Connell said it's hard to predict what kind of season the state will have.

The Star Tribune asked readers for their questions on the smoke, how to manage it and what to do to stay healthy for the rest of the summer. Find answers below (with questions that have been edited for length and clarity).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Where do I find air quality index numbers online? AQI readings are available from the private company PurpleAir, at map.purpleair.com, and on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, fire.airnow.gov. EPA's map also indicates where active fires are burning, and what areas are covered by smoke.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is the state forecast for air quality different from outdoor monitors? Forecasts from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency are 24-hour averages, and the readings on monitors from PurpleAir or others might be one-hour measurements. So the AQI may fluctuate through the day to levels below or above the full-day forecast.</p><p>When air quality is deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, how is it OK for everyone else? AQI is separated into categories based on the severity of the health risk: orange is unhealthy for sensitive groups, red is unhealthy for everyone. Purple is very unhealthy, and maroon is hazardous.</p><p>People with breathing conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are going to feel the effects of bad air before other people, experts say. Young people and the elderly are also more affected. But MPCA air quality meteorologist David Brown said earlier this month that these categories are on a spectrum - and it's possible otherwise healthy people will start to feel the effects shortly before the meter turns red.</p><p>Why are young children and older people more susceptible to unhealthy air? Younger children breathe more air per pound of body weight, said Kathy Raleigh, a principal epidemiologist for the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). They're also more likely to be exerting themselves outside by running and playing, and breathing harder.</p><p>While \"every exposure we get has impact on us over time,\" Raleigh said, the risk to children from a bad air day is probably more short term.</p><p>Older adults usually see a decline in the immune functions that help them clear damaging particles from the body, and are more likely to have underlying conditions that make them sensitive to smoke, Raleigh said.</p><p>Why does it feel like the air has gotten so bad so quickly? Was the air really that much cleaner 50 years ago? On the whole, air quality in the United States has improved since the passage of the Clean Air Act. Levels of high-priority air pollutants fell 78% between 1970 and 2020, according to the EPA.</p><p>But some of these gains are being chipped away by smoke invasions and other events related to climate change, according to the American Lung Association. The group's most recent annual air quality report notes a growing disparity between the eastern part of the country and the west, where fires had started to reverse that long-term progress.</p><p>While Minnesota faced some Canadian smoke in 2021, this year's reach has been unprecedented - with smoke furling all the way to parts of Europe, according to NASA imagery.</p><p>What kinds of masks help, and do they work for other pollution, like ozone? Experts advise that well-fitting respirators that are designed to filter tiny particles, like an N95, will offer protection for those who have to be outside. The KN95, which meets less rigorous standards, will also help but may not filter as much, Raleigh said.</p><p>Cloth masks or surgical masks won't make any difference, because the tiny particles from smoke, known as PM 2.5, will easily penetrate thinner fabrics.</p><p>Ozone - another breathing irritant that comes from the combination of sunlight and volatile compounds - is not filtered by these masks at all because it's a gas. But it can be avoided by going outside earlier in the day.</p><p>Will a window air conditioner bring smoke into my home? Just like central air, many window air-conditioning units have the option to switch between a fresh supply of air from outside or recirculating the air inside, said Pat Huelman, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota who studies healthy buildings. On bad air days, make sure the unit is recirculating. Most portable cooling appliances don't do much to filter the air, and it may not be possible to swap in a better filter.</p><p>If there is no button or knob giving the option to take in outside or \"natural\" air, then the unit is always recirculating, Huelman said. But users should make sure the unit is well insulated in the window - any gaps or cracks can let pollution sneak in.</p><p>Indoor air filters with HEPA-compliant screens can also help. It's possible to make your own version, by taping filters to a box fan.</p><p>What guidance are schools and child cares getting on responding to poor air quality? Many schools and other groups with outdoor programming have already been bringing kids inside on bad air days. The city of Bloomington closed its outdoor pool on Tuesday.</p><p>Kevin Burns, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Education, directed questions to health officials and noted that \"schools are not as populated\" over the summer, with most classes out of session.</p><p>MDH doesn't have any official guidance for schools other than the same advice for everyone, Raleigh said - limit outdoor time when the AQI spikes to unhealthy levels.</p><p>Why isn't the jet stream carrying the smoke away from Minnesota? Tyler Hasenstein, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Chanhassen, said the jet stream is constantly moving - and it hasn't been flowing over Minnesota of late. That's part of why the weather has been so hot and dry.</p><p>There are also fires burning in almost every province of Canada, meaning smoke can come from different directions. Breezes from the south don't help either, when smoke is blanketing such a broad area.</p><p>\"There's about a five- or six-state region of the Midwest suffering under the air quality and smoke issues right now,\" he said.</p><p>How are these fires connected to climate change? Generally, higher temperatures and drought make it easier for fuels on the forest floor to ignite and burn.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in a 2022 report that a warmer planet is an \"added stress\" that can contribute to wildfires in North America. Development patterns and forest management also play a role, the IPCC said.</p><p>Canada has been remarkably dry and hot this year, starting in the spring. In the atmosphere, a persistent ridge has stopped air from ascending and rainstorms from forming, Hasenstein said. That ridge has shifted from west to east, and is now sitting over Quebec, where fire activity has exploded, the Washington Post reported.</p><p>The statistics from this fire season, which is long from over, are unprecedented - there were 477 active fires and 237 were out of control as of Tuesday, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). The area burned so far across several provinces is 8 million hectares - almost the same area as Lake Superior.</p><p>What is Canada doing to put these fires out? Is the United States helping? As of last week, 3,535 people had been deployed this year to fight fires, according to the CIFFC.</p><p>There are questions about whether more resources should have been devoted to wildland fires. The New York Times reported earlier in June that budget cuts had caused the country's firefighting corps to dwindle.</p><p>Canada is accepting international help. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported this month that Canada and the United States had signed an agreement to send wildland firefighting resources across the border more easily, though the two countries have long assisted each other with fires, including during a brutal 2020 fire season in the West.</p><p>Chloe Johnson covers climate and other environmental issues for the Star Tribune.

April 14, the Arcadia Fire - a 2,900-acre wildfire - started in Monroe County, according to the DNR. Officials contained the fire within a day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DNR Forest Fire Protection Section Chief James Barnier said that due to climate change, the ideal conditions for wildfires are becoming more common in recent years. According to the 2021 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts Report, precipitation during the summer months has decreased, making Wisconsin's forests more vulnerable to wildfires.\u00a0</p><p>In Wisconsin, most wildfire risk occurs in the early spring months, according to Barnier. About 800 to 1200 wildfires occur every year in Wisconsin - most of which start accidentally, Barnier said. Many of the most damaging fires occur in mid-April to mid-May, when the snow has just melted and vegetation has dried out.\u00a0</p><p>Wisconsin Frog and Toad Survey continues for 35th yearThe University of Wisconsin Arboretum will once again be part of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resource's\u00a0annual Wisconsin Frog and Read...</p><p>While climate change can cause an increase in wildfires through the state, prescribed fire can offer some solutions. A prescribed fire, also known as a controlled burn, is very different from a wildfire. Trained professionals set prescribed fires only under specific environmental conditions for the purpose of managing land or rehabilitating natural diversity, according to the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council.\u00a0</p><p>But, with climate change altering the seasonal norms and causing more unpredictable weather, it's becoming difficult for land managers to find a time to light prescribed fires. According to the 2021 Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts Report, as Wisconsin continues to experience a warmer and wetter climate, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a timeframe to safely and effectively set prescribed fires.\u00a0</p><p>Records from early European settlers indicate that originally Southern Wisconsin was largely oak savanna, a more open grassland environment with a partial tree canopy. Each spring, Lakeshore Nature Preserve staff set prescribed fires to help restore and maintain this native diversity that was lost over the years, Projects Coordinator Adam Gundlach said.</p><p>Recent study finds how principal investigators influence lab cultureUniversity of Wisconsin Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis director Brian Burt, UW doctoral student Blayne Stone and other Read...</p><p>Today, the Lakeshore Nature Preserve works to restore this native habitat and manage areas that have become overgrown with trees and brush. Prescribed fire is an important tool for these projects, Gundlach said. Prior to European colonization, fire was so common that about half of what would become Wisconsin routinely burned due to lightning strikes or as prescribed fires set by Indigenous people to manage their environment.</p><p>When Europeans started colonizing the area, they stopped lighting prescribed fires, Gundlach said. In other areas of the country - namely the southeast - Europeans continued the Indigenous prescribed fire practices.</p><p>\"It was that European mindset,\" Gundlach said. \"So fire wasn't a European cultural practice and they definitely manage their forest differently.\"</p><p>It wasn't until the 1960s that people saw their native ecosystems suffering and became more interested in land management, Gundlach said.</p><p>According to the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council, native plants are well adapted to fire. Wildflowers and grasses in fire adapted environments have long root systems that allow them to regrow post-fire and oak trees have bark capable of withstanding fire.</p><p>Stalagmites in Wisconsin's Cave of Mounds hold clues to previous climate changes in stateA stalagmite sample at the Cave of the Mounds has shed light on the impacts of rapid temperature rise in Read...</p><p>When these fire adapted environments are healthy, they're better able to withstand the stresses caused by climate change. Fire adapted ecosystems also store large amounts of carbon in the soil. In fact, these ecosystems hold more carbon than they emit when burning, according to the Wisconsin Prescribed Fire Council.</p><p>\"The more diverse and resilient things are, the better off they will be trying to deal with all these ranging conditions out there,\" Gundlach said.\u00a0</p><p>In other cases, too much fire, especially when combined with a changing climate, can change ecosystems in unexpected ways. Like Wisconsin, the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem is also well adapted to fires, though it differs in severity and timing. Since the glaciers receded 10,000 years ago, larger, high-severity fires have burned in the greater Yellowstone region once every 100 to 300 years, according to Nathan Kiel, a UW Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Integrative Biology.</p><p>In 1988, one of these large fires burned through 36% of Yellowstone, according to the National Park Service. Now, 35 years later, 16% of the area burned in that initial fire isn't regenerating as expected, Kiel said. Where researchers expected to see forest in certain previously burned areas across Yellowstone, there isn't any.</p><p>Kiel said many of these ecosystems hold a lot of carbon, and when they burn, that carbon is released into the atmosphere. But, as forests regenerate, they then incorporate that carbon back into the forest and store it. If the forests aren't coming back, it's likely there isn't as much carbon stored in those areas.</p><p>Then, in 2016, another wildfire swept through Yellowstone and burned through forests that were still recovering after the 1988 fire.</p><p>\"That sort of event, that really short occurrance of fire, hadn't been observed at that scale before,\" Kiel said.</p><p>NASA astronomer speaks on James Webb Telescope, successes since launchBranch manager for the Jame Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Imager and Stiltless Spectrograph Instrument team, Stephanie LaMassa lectured on Read...</p><p>Because the forests in Yellowstone had evolved to fires occurring every 100 to 300 years, it's difficult for them to reestablish post-fire, Kiel said. Certain tree species can regenerate quickly after fires because pine cones only open and disperse seed after they come into contact with fire. When another fire returns so quickly, there hasn't been time to rebuild that seed source and the forests don't regenerate as well.</p><p>In Yellowstone, the soil became hotter and dryer due to less shade cast by the burned trees after the wildfires. This change meant that for any plants to grow, they would need to adapt to grow in these higher temperature soils. While most of the biodiversity remained in the plants that grow under the tree canopy, there are more plants that tend to thrive in sunny conditions than previously, Kiel said.</p><p>\"Historically, [forests] would have had a few hundred years to come back, but we're interested in this because with fire frequency increasing, we expect to see more areas that look like that,\" Kiel said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-5526012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:685X-JKY1-DY7P-T4H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1184\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Badger Herald: University of Wisconsin - Madison</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 7, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0005S4Y</classCode><className>UNITED BANK OF GEORGIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6022 STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Madison</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>WI</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Following an aborted drop of fire retardant on a forest fire, the aircraft impacted the hillside of a heavily wooded area of northern New Brunswick. The pilot sustained minor injuries. There was no post-impact fire; however, the aircraft was destroyed.</p><p>The investigation found that during the aborted drop, the power was increased to 58% of the available power, and the flaps were retracted from 30 degrees to 20 degrees. Due to the pilot's high workload and divided attention, these settings went unnoticed. The selected power setting, combined with the flap setting, contributed to a reduced airspeed as the aircraft entered a slow climb to avoid rising terrain. As the aircraft approached the rising terrain, the low altitude and tailwind resulted in the pilot perceiving that the airspeed was sufficient, when, in fact, it was decreasing.</p><p>The acoustic structures of the stall and over-torque alarms are similar in that they are both continuous tones and do not present variation in rhythm or tempo. As the aircraft approached the stall, the stall warning horn sounded. Because the pilot perceived the aircraft's speed to be sufficient, the pilot identified this audio tone to be the sound that warns of an over-torque condition, and as a result, he decreased power. As a result of the decreased power, the aircraft decelerated further, stalled and entered an incipient spin at an altitude too low to permit recovery.</p><p>The report also highlights the importance of recognizing hazards, such as illusions, involved with low-flying near steep or mountainous terrain. If pilots are not trained on these hazards, there is an increased risk of collision with terrain.</p><p>After the occurrence, Forest Protection Limited revised its Fire Suppression Manual, including procedures for an aborted drop. The company also amended its training to include annual mountain flying training and more frequent fire practice missions.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/medias-media/communiques/aviation/2022/a21a0024-20220810.html\">https://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/medias-media/communiques/aviation/2022/a21a0024-20220810.html</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>null-7917165 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7917165</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664H-DG51-JC11-10BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The environmental campaign group said that analysis of satellite images showed the fire at its closest point was just 1.5 kilometres (less than a mile) from the protective dome over the ruined reactor. </p><p>Sergiy Zibtsev, head of the Regional Eastern European Fire Monitoring Center, told AFP that the fire is \"super-huge\" and \"unpredictable\".\"In the west of the exclusion zone it has already covered 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) by our calculations.\"The Ukrainian emergency service has not provided recent figures on the size of the fire.Yaroslav Yemelianenko, head of the Chernobyl tour guide association, said the fire had reached the ghost town of Pripyat, a city near Chernobyl whose population of around 50,000 was evacuated after the explosion. The fire broke out 10 days ago at the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986 Photo: AFP / Volodymyr Shuvayev Pripyat has become popular with tourists from all over the world.\"The situation is critical,\" Yemelianenko wrote on his Facebook page.Ukraine's deputy interior minister Anton Gerashchenko, however, said there is no danger for the nuclear waste storage facilities.\"It's completely safe,\" he said on Facebook.The fire broke out on April 4 in a forested area near the Chernobyl power plant.Police said the blaze was started by a man burning dry grass near the exclusion zone around the ruined reactor.The flames spread quickly, fanned by strong winds, and Kiev began deploying helicopters and firefighting planes.Government agencies have insisted the fire has not caused a spike in radiation levels.The head of the state ecological service, Yegor Firsov, wrote on Facebook a day after the fire broke out that levels at the centre of the fire were higher than normal. He later withdrew the claim.Chernobyl polluted a large swathe of Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986.People are not allowed to live within 30 kilometres (18 miles) of the power station.The three other reactors at Chernobyl continued to generate electricity until the power station finally closed in 2000. A giant protective dome was put in place over the fourth reactor in 2016. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158681794809325876100150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YND-TJ91-JCMN-Y05M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><timeReceived>10:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The United States alleged that the fire ignited due to a railroad locomotive that experienced mechanical failure. By the time the fire was suppressed, 387 acres had been burned within the Superior National Forest, and another 585 acres belonging to St. Louis County and private landowners. The fire cost more than $1.5 million to suppress, threatened the nearby City of Hoyt Lakes and forced the evacuation of several residences in the community of Skibo, Minnesota.</p><p>The United States sought to recover damages from WISCONSIN CENTRAL LTD and CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY for their failure to maintain the equipment that started the fire. Under the settlement announced today, WISCONSIN CENTRAL LTD and CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY have paid $1.25 million to settle the dispute.</p><p>\"This settlement goes a long way toward compensating the public for the expense of fighting the fire and the damage to public lands,\" said U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald. \"The U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to aggressively pursue recovery against those whose carelessness damages our precious national resources.\"</p><p>\"This is another reminder that everyone has an important role to play in fire prevention,\" said USDA Forest Service Acting Eastern Region Regional Forester Robert Lueckel. \"We all must remain vigilant, especially during fire season.\"</p><p>This case was handled by the Affirmative Civil Enforcement unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota and was investigated by U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigation Division, the State of Minnesota Fire Marshall's Office, the State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the East Range Police Department.</p><p>The case was settled prior to the United States filing suit. The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123656221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSM-4511-JCBF-S54V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"430\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Firefighting drones can be remotely controlled and can carry firefighting equipment such as foam dispensers or water cannons. The major purpose of designing firefighting drones was to control fires in areas that are inaccessible to firefighters or fire trucks like dense forests and high-rise buildings. These drones are capable to monitor and capture scenes in instances where firefighters and fire trucks cannot reach them. Several benefits associated with firefighting drones to prevent fire damages is expected to drive the market growth over the forecast period. </p><p>Growing instances of fire-related accidents in the oil and gas industry are majorly driving the demand for firefighters drones. In this industry, drones are being deployed for several applications such as inspection of offshore platforms, leak detection in pipelines, refining equipment, emergency response, and material handling.\u00a0 As per Cognitive Market Research's latest publishedreport, the Global Firefighting Drone market size was $1.31 Billion in 2022 and it is forecasted to reach $2.76 Billion by 2030. Firefighting Drone Industry's Compound Annual Growth Rate will be 9.8% from 2023 to 2030.\u00a0 The report said: \"In recent years, firefighting drones are used to fight forest fires. These drones can fly immediately to the location and map the affected area. During a forest fire, a firefighter drone gathers information about hitting hot spots with the help of thermal sensors and provides the information to firefighters. Footage or scenes captured by a firefighter drone is converted into a 3D map that allows civil authorities to determine the extent of the damage after the incident and verify damage claims by insurance companies.\"\u00a0 Active companies in the markets this week include:Draganfly Inc.(NASDAQ: DPRO) (CSE: DPRO),Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT),Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc.(NASDAQ: KTOS),Boeing(NYSE: BA),NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA).</p><p>Cognitive Market Research\u00a0continued: \"In addition, firefighter drones can carry many fire extinguishing components such as foam dispensers or water cannons and spread them in an affected location to prevent further fire spread. Thus, several benefits of these drones are flourishing the market growth during the assessment period.\u00a0 In 2022, North America dominated the firefighting drone market and gained the largest market share of 40.5%. This growth is due to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) supporting initiatives and high government spending on the development of drones in the region. In the U.S., 43 states have active drone programs, and the highest number of drones found in Texas at 28, in 2022 which is expected to further propel the market growth in coming years.\"</p><p>Draganfly Inc.(NASDAQ:DPRO) (CSE:DPRO)BREAKING NEWS:\u00a0 Draganfly Awarded Canadian Provincial Wildfire Services Contract -Draganfly's technology and drone pilot crews will detect and map wildfires and hotspots for Canadian provincial government to help mitigate the impact of wildfires \u00a0-Draganfly Inc.

According to news reporting from Pisa, Italy, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fire is a recurring and serious environmental hazard, which is often due to the interaction between anthropogenic activities and climate change, despite having always characterized the vegetation landscape in the Mediterranean area.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Regione Toscana. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Pisa: \"Alongside the required prevention and control works, there is an increasing need for post-fire monitoring. This is particularly relevant when it comes to natural or semi-natural forests, so that inappropriate reforestation is not undertaken without having well understood the dynamics of self-regeneration and the resilience of pre-existing phytocoenoses to fire. These monitoring operations often take a long time, but a quick picture of the severity of the fire and the response of the vegetation is also required. In this context, the data relating to post-fire surveys on a maritime pine forest of Monte Pisano (northern Tuscany, Italy), obtained from ground surveys and drone shots, are reported. This investigation showed: (1) UAV technology has proved to be very useful and fast, and it allows a good identification of tree/shrub species and forest structural parameters. (2) In these forests, repeated fires cause the disappearance of pine woods ad substitution with 'pyroclimax' cork oak communities in equilibrium with a regime of repeated fires.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"(3) These first results, part of an ongoing investigation, contribute to a better understanding of the sylvogenetic processes following the passage of fire and can support the management of burned areas.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: UAVs Technology as a Complementary Tool in Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery Surveys in Mediterranean Fire-Prone Forests.

These birds require large gaps in the forest canopy, or top-most layer, to produce offspring.</p><p>\"When we do this kind of operation, we create this early successional forest in between the larger trees, which is great for box turtles and other birds to fledge their young,\" Amendola said.</p><p>Amendola said the project is mimicking a large-scale forest fire or windstorm that would, in theory, take out the overstory, or the highest layer of foliage in the forest, and allow that new, young growth that many species are dependent on. He said the project is a part of the management plan for the Nehantic forest.</p><p>Each state forest has a plan written every 10 years to identify ecological needs, with the Nehantic forest's plan written in 2016 by Gluck, Amendola's predecessor. The Nehantic is mostly made of of various species of oak trees, and the 110 acres that the project encompasses were identified as locations primed for diversification.</p><p>\"Now it's eight years after that plan has been written [and] we've finally gotten to the point where we're going to complete this operation,\" Amendola said.</p><p>Species with lower shade tolerance and require more sunlight, such as tulips, oaks and hickory, will be able to grow more as a result of the operation. A lot of birch will be cut as it is not very important to the ecosystem and the forest tends to get an excess amount of it that's to its ability to seed for up to seven years.</p><p>DEEP plans to start the project in December, though it will depend on how severe the winter weather gets. Due to the mating times for ground bird species in the forest, there is a hard cutoff for the months of May, June and July and the projected is scheduled to take more that one season to complete.</p><p>\"It's going to be a long process, for sure,\" said James Halleran of Perma Treat, a saw mill based in Durham.</p><p>Perma Treat won the bid to purchase chopped timber from the project, though Halleran was unsure of the exact cost. He said the company, which specializes in making railroad ties, has done other work in the area. The company is looking for mostly straight and clear 9-foot-long logs, which can also be used for boards, wood chips, sawdust, and bark mulch to be sold.</p><p>There will be approximately 344,969 board feet of saw timber and 578 cords of firewood created from the project.</p><p>Amendola explained without local sawmill in the market for these types of logs, projects like this would not be possible as it would be a great cost at DEEP's expense to take care of the cut timber.</p><p>\"A lot of these operations to kind of adjust the ecosystem to our objectives wouldn't really be possible without a lower-grade market, which a lot of these trees would be viewed economically as lower-grade logs,\" he said.</p><p>Amendola said before every silvicultural operation \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the growing and cultivation of trees \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 like this, DEEP does extensive public outreach. On the pre-harvest walk, which included property abutters, members of the state General Assembly and the Lyme Land Trust, Open Space Coordinator and Vice President of the Lyme Land Trust Wendy Hill asked Amendola if he and Gluck would do an informative talk on the matter at the library and then conduct Sunday's walking tour with more than a dozen residents of southeastern Connecticut.</p><p>\"A lot of people in the town use the trails in Nehantic, and I did get some people asking me what the blue marks are,\" Hill recalled.</p><p>While the public interest was appreciated, Amendola understands that cutting trees for any reason is a divisive topic these days. Some people are all for it, while others are very much against it.</p><p>\"It's really just important to look at our forests in a landscape scale and understand the needs of the ecosystem,\" Amendola said. \"Many of these ecosystems evolved with and are dependent on disturbance, which is what we are mimicking here.\"</p><p>\"So I encourage anyone who's looking into this or sees the blue paint on the trees to understand what we're trying to achieve before they pass judgment on cutting the trees,\" he added.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:k.arnold@gmail.com\">k.arnold@gmail.com</email></p><p>___ (c)2023 The Day (New London, Conn.)

According to news reporting from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Most climatic models show that climate change affects natural perils' frequency and severity. Quantifying the impact of future climate conditions on natural hazard is essential for mitigation and adaptation planning.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Ton Duc Thang University, \"One crucial factor to consider when using climate simulations projections is the inherent systematic differences (bias) of the modelled data compared with observations. This bias can originate from the modelling process, the techniques used for downscaling of results, and the ensembles' intrinsic variability. Analysis of climate simulations has shown that the biases associated with these data types can be significant. Hence, it is often necessary to correct the bias before the data can be reliably used for further analysis. Natural perils are often associated with extreme climatic conditions. Analysing trends in the tail end of distributions are already complicated because noise is much more prominent than that in the mean climate. The bias of the simulations can introduce significant errors in practical applications. In this paper, we present a methodology for bias correction of climate simulated data. The technique corrects the bias in both the body and the tail of the distribution (extreme values). As an illustration, maps of the 50 and 100-year return period of climate simulated Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) in Australia are presented and compared against the corresponding observation-based maps. The results show that the algorithm can substantially improve the calculation of simulation-based return periods.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Forthcoming work will focus on the impact of climate change on these return periods considering future climate conditions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Bias Correction of Extreme Values of High-resolution Climate Simulations for Risk Analysis.

Steps for individuals to take to reduce risk, include:</p><p>When AQI is greater than 100 ('Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups'), New Yorkers in vulnerable groups should avoid exertion outdoors and watch for symptoms when exposed to the outdoors. Vulnerable individuals include those with cardiovascular disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, history of prior heart attack) or lung disease (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), as well as children under 18, adults 65 and older, and pregnant people.</p><p>When AQI is greater than 150 ('Unhealthy'), all New Yorkers should avoid strenuous outdoor activities, and those in vulnerable groups should avoid exposure to the outdoors, especially pregnant individuals who may become short of breath more easily. In addition, some employees who are vulnerable should work indoors and camp directors should know their local AQI forecast and alert level and follow AQI guidance.</p><p>When AQI is greater than 200 ('Very Unhealthy'), vulnerable groups should avoid all physical activity outdoors, and reschedule or move activities indoors. All others should avoid long or intense outdoor activities.</p><p>When AQI is greater than 300 ('Hazardous'), all New Yorkers should avoid outdoor physical activities.</p><p>For people who spend time outdoors, when air quality is unhealthy, wearing a well-fitting face mask is recommended.

In addition, some employees who are vulnerable should work indoors and camp directors should know their local AQI forecast and alert level and follow AQI guidance.</p><p>* When AQI is greater than 200 ('Very Unhealthy'), vulnerable groups should avoid all physical activity outdoors, and reschedule or move activities indoors. All others should avoid long or intense outdoor activities.</p><p>* When AQI is greater than 300 ('Hazardous'), all New Yorkers should avoid outdoor physical activities.</p><p>* For people who spend time outdoors, when air quality is unhealthy, wearing a well-fitting face mask is recommended. A N95 or KN95 will work best.</p><p>More information about New York State Air Quality forecast is available here.

As part of the City of Trees Challenge, these seedlings will improve wildlife habitat and help the land heal from impacts of the fire, ensuring these forests recover, grow and provide opportunities for current and future generations of Idahoans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the first major planting effort of the City of Trees Challenge, a ten-year initiative started by the City of Boise and Council President Elaine Clegg, aimed at planting 100,000 trees within the city and 235,000 seedlings in Idaho forests. In October and November of this year, 1000 trees were planted with 500 trees being given to Boise residents and the remainder planted by the City. The funding from Arbor Day Foundation provides an important start toward planting 235,000 seedlings by 2030.</p><p>\"The City of Boise has set a big goal with concrete action to improve quality of life and fight the effects of climate change - to plant a tree for every household and a seedling for every resident\" said City Council President Elaine Clegg. \"We are excited to partner with the Treasure Valley Canopy Network, The Nature Conservancy in Idaho (TNC) and the Arbor Day Foundation to begin work on the second part of that goal with these 37,000 seedlings.\"</p><p>The Nature Conservancy was one of the initial partners the City brought on. \"We are delighted to be a part of the City of Trees Challenge as the lead partner in the seedling effort,\" says Mark Menlove, State Director for TNC in Idaho. \"Planting trees has been identified as a natural climate solution to reduce greenhouse gases and to help our communities adapt to a changing climate. By working with both our urban and rural partners, we believe this effort will have a significant impact.\"</p><p>The Arbor Day Foundation funding will support the planting trees within the Boise National Forest as part of a fire rehabilitation in Upper Clear Creek, burned during the 2016 Pioneer Fire. This project will plant ponderosa pine and Douglas fir this coming spring to rehabilitate areas to improve soil stability, forest health and wildlife habitat in the forest. This will be the first planting towards the 235,000 seedling goal.</p><p>\"The City of Trees Challenge highlights the importance of both restoring and protecting our nation's forests and bringing the benefits of community trees to our cities and towns,\" said Dan Lambe, president of the Arbor Day Foundation. \"We are proud to help preserve the beauty and the many ecological benefits of the Boise National Forest for generations to come.\"</p><p>The City of Trees Challenge began as an idea by City Council President, Elaine Clegg. This community-wide initiative inspires Boiseans to plant a new tree for every household across the city - in every corner of every neighborhood for a total of 100,000 over ten years. The Challenge also impacts forests around the state by empowering Boiseans to sponsor a forest seedling for every Boise resident (235,000 seedlings). For the Challenge, the City has partnered with the Treasure Valley Canopy Network, The Nature Conservancy and more.</p><p>The Treasure Valley Canopy Network is a regional publicprivate partnership that invests in building and supporting healthy and vibrant Treasure Valley Communities. As a lead partner in the City of Trees Challenge, the Network is helping build critical partnerships that ensure the Challenge leaves a lasting impact on climate mitigation not only within Boise, but across Idaho and the U.S.</p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7312776 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7312776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61F5-PK11-JC11-153F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting from Valparaiso, Chile, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Mediterranean climate regions have become more vulnerable to fire due to the extreme weather conditions and numerous * * Eucalyptus globulus* * plantation areas.\"</p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Fondecyt De Iniciacion.<br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria: \"The aim of this study is to analyze the fire hazard related to * * E. globulus* * in a forest fire scenario, based on the contrast of thermochemical parameters and their relationship with chemical properties, considering the predominant exotic forest species (* * E. globulus* * , * * Pinus radiata* * , * * Acacia dealbata* * , and * * Acacia melanoxylon* * ) present in the Valparaiso region, Chile. The results revealed that although all of the studied species were highly flammable, * * E. globulus* * was extremely flammable, as its leaves contain high concentrations of essential oils, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, which can generate a flammable atmosphere due to their low flashpoint and the strong negative influence shown between the essential oils, volatile terpenes, and limonene concentration. Moreover, the heat of combustion of * * E. globulus* * was positively correlated with its high essential oil contents.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, all of the studied species had low flashpoints and high heating values; therefore, they are predisposed to ignite in the presence of a heat source, releasing high amounts of energy during combustion, which contributes to the risk of the formation and spread of canopy fires among these tree formations.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: Drivers of Flammability of * * Eucalyptus globulus* * Labill Leaves: Terpenes, Essential Oils, and Moisture Content. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forests</emphasis>, 2022,13(908):908.

In Haaland v. Brackeen, Barrett wrote the decision upholding a 1978 law aimed at preserving Native American adoptees' ties to their tribes and traditions.

Both joined Alito's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\"> opinion</url> overturning Roe. But they don't exhibit the same slash-and-burn arrogance. Kavanaugh has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf\">directly challenged Thomas' views</url> on stare decisis. Barrett has also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/31/conservative-justices-precedent-affirmative-action-00064343\">eschewed</url> the Thomas-Alito-DeSantis playbook. Overall, both show a bit more <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2023/5/17/23727034/supreme-court-assault-rifles-weapons-shadow-docket-national-association-gun-rights-naperville\">humility</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a240_d18e.pdf\">deliberation</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/02/amy-coney-barrett-death-penalty-religious-liberty.html?pay=1687201323178&amp;support_journalism=please\">moderation</url> and a lot less belligerence.</p><p>Kavanaugh's commitment to stare decisis has led to surprising outcomes this term. In late May, he refused to sign on to Alito's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf\"> opinion</url> curbing the EPA's authority to protect wetlands, arguing that Alito's opinion departed from precedent. And, last week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf\">Kavanaugh joined the majority</url> to hold that the Voting Rights Act required Alabama to draw another majority-Black congressional district. Why? Stare decisis, as he explained in his concurrence.</p><p>DeSantis' appointees, in contrast, have jumped at entrenching conservative electoral domination and curtailing Black political power. Ignoring existing law, DeSantis' justices have<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/02/florida-redistricting-map-court-decision-00036740\"> rubber-stamped</url> the governor's extreme gerrymandering of congressional districts, which dismantled a majority-Black district;<url normalizedValue=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2020/01/florida-supreme-court-advisory-opinion-on-amendment-4-raises-constitutional-concerns/\"> blessed</url> DeSantis' plot to gut a voter initiative that restored voting rights to felons; and blocked progressive initiatives, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-florida-supreme-court-rejects-3954869/\">legalizing marijuana</url> and<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2020/06/05/florida-supreme-court-prevents-assault-weapons-ban-amendment-from-getting-to-voters/\"> banning assault weapons</url>, from appearing on the ballot.</p><p>Imitating Thomas and Alito, DeSantis' appointees have rushed into gratuitous political controversies, writing opinions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2020/06/03/diversity-of-thought-is-vanishing-at-florida-supreme-court-editorial/\">heavy</url> on theory and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2020/10/30/a-day-of-infamy-at-floridas-death-court-editorial/\">light</url> on practicality. Barrett and Kavanaugh have been more pragmatic, taking into account functional considerations as well as outcomes.</p><p>In January 2022, Kavanaugh joined an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a240_d18e.pdf\">opinion</url> allowing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a240_d18e.pdf\">Biden administration</url> to require certain employees at facilities receiving federal funding to get vaccinated against Covid-19. The decision stressed the \"scale and scope\" of the pandemic. And in the recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-376_7l48.pdf\">decision</url> affirming Congress' power to enact a federal law that gives relatives and tribes priority in the foster care and adoption of Native American children, Barrett carefully reviewed precedent and the complexities of America's child welfare system.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020's Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, they both<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-123_g3bi.pdf\"> rejected</url> Alito's fierce pleading to slay Employment Division v. Smith, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/04/03/how-religious-freedom-laws-were-praised-then-hated-then-forgotten-then-finally-resurrected/\">precedent loathed</url> by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/lgbtq-rights-dodge-a-supreme-court-bullet-but-more-shots-are-coming\">religious right</url> because it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/F7.MellingFinalDraftFinal_uk4pt5r1.pdf\">makes</url> it harder for people and institutions to demonstrate they are entitled to religious exemptions. As Barrett wrote, \"There would be a number of issues to work through if Smith were overruled.\"</p><p>By contrast, the DeSantis court has indulged the most outlandish theories of the legal right. In December, it<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/12/22/florida-supreme-court-oks-desantis-request-grand-jury-covid-vaccine-issues/\"> approved</url> DeSantis' breathtaking request to impanel a statewide grand jury to investigate unspecified \"wrongdoing\" related to the Covid vaccines. Alito and Thomas have similarly <url normalizedValue=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2022/07/the-paranoid-style-in-the-supreme-court/\">promoted anti-vaccine</url> rhetoric. Thomas (and to a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-542_2c83.pdf\"> lesser</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/12/trumps-spin-his-big-supreme-court-failure-is-bad-his-legal-case/\"> extent</url>, Alito) also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-542_2c83.pdf\">agitated</url> to hear cases based on Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" delusion that he had won the 2020 presidential election. Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett have had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/14/most-remarkable-rebukes-trumps-legal-case-judges-he-hand-picked/\">no</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/22168109/trump-coup-steal-election-judges-judiciary-supreme-court-gorsuch-kavanaugh-barrett\">patience</url> for these canards.</p><p>Gorsuch, for his part, is more closely aligned with Alito and Thomas than with Barrett or Kavanaugh. But he's shown a type of unpredictability alien to DeSantis' nominees, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2022/10/04/reject-four-florida-supreme-court-justices/\">vote together</url> in politically charged cases. He's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/supreme-court-upholds-indian-child-welfare-act/\">emerged</url> as the court's strongest champion of Native American rights and, over the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-715_febh.pdf\">dissents</url> of Thomas and Alito, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-715_febh.pdf\">voted</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-635_o7jq.pdf\">repeatedly</url> to let legal investigations into Trump proceed. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cap-press.com/pdf/CurtisConstitutionalLawinContext4e2022SuppWM.pdf\">Gorsuch's rigid</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/06/symposium-the-triumph-of-textualism-only-the-written-word-is-the-law/\">textualism</url> has also led him away from the party line in a seminal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf\">LGBTQ rights</url> case and in cases involving<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-pornography/conservative-u-s-justice-gorsuch-again-sides-with-liberals-in-criminal-case-idUSKCN1TR2WD\"> criminal procedure</url> and<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/gorsuch-dissents-with-liberals-when-supreme-court-bars-immigrants-challenge-to-alleged-factual-error\"> immigrants</url>.</p><p>DeSantis loathes this independent streak, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?517647-3/florida-governor-desantis-conversation-federalist-society-conference\">saying</url> in 2022 that one of the \"frustrating things\" about today's Supreme Court is that \"in these high-profile cases, you know those three liberal justices will vote the same every single time,\" whereas on the conservative side, there aren't \"the same guarantees.\" His claim of liberal groupthink was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1449_d9eh.pdf\">off-base</url> but still revealing: DeSantis wants conservative judges to rule in lockstep.</p><p>I write as <url normalizedValue=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2022/07/the-paranoid-style-in-the-supreme-court/\">no fan</url> of <url normalizedValue=\"https://linktree.com/duncanhosie\">Trump's appointees</url>. We shouldn't downplay a forest fire by pointing to the explosive bursts of a fiery volcano; both will burn. Yet it's a mistake for my fellow liberals to think of the conservative legal movement as a monolith, or assume the Supreme Court has reached rock bottom just because the current court is a horror show largely of Trump's making. It's not just intellectually lazy but also increasingly dangerous to lump all of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://fedsoc.org/\">Federalist Society</url>'s factions together.</p><p>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-136/the-imperial-supreme-court/\">imperial</url> flank of this movement wants to use the courts to impose a conservative agenda that has until now not been unachievable through legislation, and empowers the judicial branch above the others in enacting it. Thomas and Alito are in this vanguard, as are DeSantis' appointees and some of Trump's lower court appointees, with which DeSantis is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/politics/desantis-supreme-court-conservative-majority/index.html\">aligned</url>. <url normalizedValue=\"https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/trump-says-the-supreme-court-will-go-down-in-history-as-gutless-refuses-to-admit-he-lost-last-novembers-election-fair-and-square/\">Signs</url> suggest a vengeful Trump could be, too, if returned to the White House.</p><p>Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court haven't fully joined the crusade. This isn't a testament to their moderation; it instead reflects the extremism of the others. But it doesn't make this distinction any less real. There's a world of difference between Trump's justices and DeSantis'.         </p><p>             Opinion by Duncan Hosie         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Airbnbs offer more homelike environments and often have kitchen and laundry facilities, extra bedrooms for kids, and living spaces for parents to enjoy after the kids are asleep. Airbnb rentals often have more pizzazz and personality than a hotel room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Summer travelers on a budget who are still looking for that wow factor in an Airbnb rental are in luck. A study conducted by BetMGM analyzed Airbnb data to reveal the most affordable wow factor Airbnbs across the U.S. Millennials, or anyone else wanting both a unique and affordable vacation experience, can check out these top 10 wow factor Airbnbs.</p><p>Airbnbs Are Most Popular With Millennial Travelers</p><p>Millennials, defined as someone born between 1981 and 1996, are approaching middle age and are often parents. According to YouGov and research firm Morning Consult, millennial travelers seek unique and budget-friendly stays offered by an Airbnb versus a traditional hotel. Here's how these 10 budget-friendly and unique Airbnbs stack up.</p><p>Baying Hound Campground is the Most Affordable Wow Factor Airbnb</p><p>The hosts have a range of stays on Airbnb, but their cheapest offering is the Trippy Tortoise Shell-ter, at $25 a night and a 4.90-star review; it includes a part truck cab and turtle-inspired permanent campervan/tent, which the hosts playfully refer to as \"shell-ters.\" The exteriors are decorated by professional artists.</p><p>The floors are padded, but Superhosts Bobby and Amanda recommend bringing sleeping pads along with sleeping bags. The Baying Hound Campground is located 10 minutes from downtown Ashville, North Carolina.</p><p>Second Place: Chicken Coop Grain Bin in Blanchard, Oklahoma</p><p>At $49 a night and a 5.0-star rating, this private room on a farm is a repurposed grain bin surrounded by cows, guineas, chickens, and a peacock.</p><p>The Chicken Coop Gain Bin sleeps two. The bathroom and kitchen are shared with another unit. Guests can purchase farm-raised, 100 percent grass-fed ground beef from the farm to enhance their stay.</p><p>Third Place: The Retreat in Pulaski, New York</p><p>The Retreat is priced at $60 a night and has a 4.99 rating. The host describes it as \"A private room in a unique home, impeccably maintained, and located along a peaceful rural road.\" Amenities include a nearby river and a snowmobile trail.</p><p>Scenic NYS Route 3, 1.5 miles away, will take you to local beaches and state parks, as well as more local fishing spots and restaurants.</p><p>North Carolina and Washington State Tie for Fourth Place</p><p>Joint fourth on the list is Yome Away from Home in Weaverville, North Carolina, and Beautiful Getaway in Spokane, Washington.</p><p>Yome Away from Home is a $62-a-night yurt with a 4.88-star review. The yurt comes with a queen mattress, mini kitchen, and dining area and has a propane heater provided from October to March.</p><p>Beautiful Getaway has a 4.89-star review and is on a 500-acre nature preserve with a pond, wildlife, and trails. Inside amenities include a heated floor and a fully stocked commercial kitchen.</p><p>Fifth Place: Underground Hobbit Hole at Sustainable Ecovillage, Del Norte County, California</p><p>If you've ever wanted to say you spent the night in a hobbit hole, this unique Airbnb is $64 a night and has a 4.55-star rating. The unit is built into the side of a mountain in an off-the-grid village in Northern California's Smith River Canyon.</p><p>Host Dan warns that this unique farm stay unit can be damp during the rainy season and advises guests to bring their own firewood.</p><p>Sixth Place: Retromania Airbnb in Houston </p><p>Airbnb Retromania has a 4.50-star rating and runs $116 a night. The host describes it as a unique and interactive home that welcomes photoshoots and a creative artsy interior.</p><p>This space in Houston's Montrose neighborhood sleeps four and is a pop culture lover's dream. With bright, splashy decor and Instagrammable wall art and murals, everything about the decor is whimsical and fun.</p><p>Seventh Place: Chalet by the Lake in Conneaut Lake Pennsylvania </p><p>This Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania, Airbnb runs $80 per night and has a 4.97 rating. The newly renovated chalet is located on 11+ acres and within minutes of Conneaut Lake, Firemans Beach, and Icehouse Park.</p><p>The Chalet sleeps six, making it an affordable choice for a larger family or two families vacationing together.</p><p>Eighth Place: Sun One Organic Farm in Bethlehem, Connecticut</p><p>If you've ever wanted to sleep in a silo, you can for $73 a night. This converted 1940's silo on a working produce farm has a 30-foot ceiling and a bathroom designed by one of the leading green building designers in the country. This unique Airbnb has a rating of 4.79.</p><p>The bathroom facilities are in a separate building from the bedroom. Guests are welcome to walk around the 65-acre farm and may access an outdoor firepit as long as no forest fire alerts are in place.</p><p>A Four-way Tie for the Ninth Spot</p><p>Tied for the ninth place are four AirbnbBs. These include the Cozy-Warm-Adorable Hobbit House in Bainbridge Island, Washington, the Stargazing Hut \u2013 Mossy Forest Glamping in Newport, Tennessee, The Bunkhouse at Love's Hideaway in Lagro, Indiana, and The Silo in Collbran, Colorado.</p><p>The Hobbit House in Bainbridge Island, Washington, is $78 per night and sleeps two adults.

The Silo in Colbran, Colorado, is $71 and ideal for anyone seeking solitude. There's plenty of open space but no indoor plumbing or television.</p><p>Two Texas Airbnbs Tie for Tenth Place</p><p>Both of these Texas Airbnbs can be rented for $79 per night: Luxury Jail Suite in Pearland, with a 4.88 rating, and Nopalito Train Car Apartment Edinburg, Texas, with a rating of 4.95.</p><p>The Luxury Jail Suite sleeps four and comes complete with orange robes and prison props for memorable vacation photos.

Welcome everyone to the 42nd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. My name is Anupam Rama. I am one of the senior biotech analysts here at JPMorgan. I'm joined by my squad: Malcolm Kuno, Priyanka Grover, LaRhea Hall. Our next presenting company is Apellis and presenting on behalf of the company, we have CEO Cedric Francois.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you so much, Anupam, and thank you for inviting us again to speak here. It's great to see many familiar faces. Let's dive straight into what is a special year that we have in front of us after 2023, which all of you know had quite a bit of tumultuous events in it. I will be making some forward-looking statements. And I want to start off with this slide, which reminds us of what we really do at Apellis where we combine courageous science with compassion. And that has resulted in two approved drugs since our time when we went public in 2017 in EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE. EMPAVELI, as a reminder, was the very first therapy to target complement factor C3 and as you all know has done very well in PNH as the first and leading indication. SYFOVRE was the first treatment available for the leading cause of blindness in geographic atrophy approved in February of last year.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pipeline that is growing focused on complement and specifically the special target of C3. So for 2024, we have four priorities. Number one is to maximize access to SYFOVRE to patients in need in this country. Secondly, we aim to bring SYFOVRE to patients with geographic atrophy worldwide. Of course in the European Union we've had a little hiccup. We're going to continue to work diligently towards an approval there as well. Third, we aim to maximize EMPAVELI in PNH and then to expand in this new indication in C3G and IC-MPGN to important kidney indications that are rare, but very important in terms of unmet need for which no therapies again are approved at this point. And then we have our early pipeline and our collaboration with Beam on which you should expect to hear much more this year as well.</p><p>So, let's dive right in first of all into geographic atrophy. So, what is geographic atrophy? I like to make the comparison to a forest fire in your retina where patients that have this disease are on a relentless progression towards blindness where more and more retinal cells are lost. More than 1 million patients in the US are affected by this disease, more than 5 million patients globally. And to give you a sense of what this disease really means, nearly 7 in 10 people with geographic atrophy believe that the impact on independence and quality of life due to this disease is actually worse than they had expected at the start of their diagnosis. This is a really important health problem, affects elderly people with what is arguably their greatest source of joy towards the end of their lives and something where we feel we have a great responsibility to contribute to slow that disease down.</p><p>Then this morning we announced the Q4 numbers. We had $114 million in sale in the fourth quarter. We had $275 million over the first 10 months of the launch making this one of the strongest launches in the past 10 years in our industry During that period 160,000 vials were distributed, of which we believe approximately 150,000 were administered to patients. So, here we are with SYFOVRE being the market leading treatment for GA in the US with approximately 95% of patients in this country being treated with SYFOVRE within that market segment and that is because this is a drug that shows more efficacy over time, where we have more experience, and where we can create more vision for patients So, let's start with what more efficacy means. This is a drug with a very unique feature and that is the fact that patients with geographic atrophy that go on treatment; the longer they are on treatment, the more profound the slowdown in the loss of photoreceptor cells is.</p><p>So when you have patients with what we call non-subfoveal lesions, which are the patients that we believe can probably benefit most from this treatment, in the third year the slowdown of the degenerative process is 42%. That means when you are affected by this disease, you have an opportunity to slowdown the loss of these photoreceptor cells almost in half. Something really important that we see both with monthly as well as with every other month treatment. And then I want to take a brief moment to look at this slide. We all know what happened in the summer of last year, I mean in the real world things like that can happen This particular extremely rare finding is one to which physicians in the retina space are sensitive.</p><p>But it is one where we made a determination in the summer of last year to hold physicians by their hands, to be fully transparent, and to guide them through that and make them understand that this was and continues to be an extremely rare phenomenon, which by the way affect also other complement inhibitors in this area as well as anti-VEGF agents. It was all a matter of kind of going through it and making sure that we were fully transparent through the process. I can tell you that since I've had the privilege of leading this company, I've never been prouder of the team that we have and the integrity with which this was done. So here we are, 95% of total patient share, more than 150,000 injections, double-digit numbers of new sites each week, strong access and reimbursement, and this growth which is now again on a track where it was in the spring and you have a little dip of course because of Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's.</p><p>This last week we had our biggest day by far since the launch as well. So, this is a drug that we believe is there to stay to be available to these patients with this devastating disease. And what does this mean for vision? So we always get the question okay, this drug slows down the degenerative process. Why don't you show functional improvement? The problem in geographic atrophy is that showing a functional improvement in any disease in the retina is very difficult to do and takes a long period of time and takes a lot of patience because we do not have the tools to do it. Now thankfully in the OAKS trial, we did have a tool that is intensive, takes a lot of time, but we did it in all of these subjects called microperimetry. And what we do there is we use a laser and we individually interrogate 68 dots in the retina for light sensitivity and when we do that, we get a pretty good picture of what goes on.</p><p>Now within this context, you could argue that the four central dots within that grid are the ones that are most important for things like reading, like recognizing faces. It is what contributes to the central vision, which is the one that you use when you read for example a Snellen chart at your optometrist, right? So when we analyze these four central dots in the microperimetry, the results that we get is first of all, an association with that best corrected visual acuity, that central vision where patients that lose all of these four central dots have about a line more loss overall than patients that do not. And when you do that analysis, you see clear correlation to that functional improvement in patients for a monthly as well as every other month. This is by the way something that can be repeated when you take the central 16 points as well.</p><p>The feedback from physicians has been overwhelmingly positive. I think especially in the last summer when we went through what we went, being able to communicate, being able to tell physicians and patients over time how this was being updated; continuously being there with our Chief Medical Officer, Caroline Baumal who's sitting here with us, guiding us through that, has been really rewarding. And the retina community at large right now has trust and confidence and that is something that I think was essential in the summer of last year and which contributed to our very impressive recovery. Okay. Then SYFOVRE ex-US. What does this mean for patients ex-US? Just in Europe, more than 2.5 million patients are affected by this disease. There are no approved treatments available outside of the US as was the case before February last year here as well and 84% of European eyecare professionals are convinced that early GA treatment is essential.</p><p>As most of you know, we had a hiccup in that process in Europe mostly based on the fact that the functional analyses that we have in DERBY and OAKS are post-hoc analyses. Again going back to the point that we made earlier, there is a reason why measuring photoreceptor cell loss anatomically is the primary endpoint in all of these studies is because we can actually very easily measure it. Correlating it to function requires post-hoc analysis and that requires a lot of education, a lot of eyecare feedback, and that is what we are going to go through now. At the end of this month, we will have a negative opinion from the CHMP. We will appeal that. And then in the second quarter of 2024, we will have a final answer. Now there's no doubt that this will be an uphill process, but one that we are firmly committed to for the benefit of patients and physicians.</p><p>Then moving on to EMPAVELI in PNH and C3G IC-MPGN. So, EMPAVELI continues to elevate the standard of care in PNH. We had $91 million in sales last year with $24 million in the last quarter. And importantly, since we have the PRINCE-naive -- the PRINCE trial treatment naive data included as well now, 10% of demand in 2023 was from those treatment naive patients. So, really kind of stepping into that first line concept. We also have 97% patient compliance rates. There's not a lot of drugs that can show numbers like this and that is of course correlated to the following. That we have an unprecedented safety profile for EMPAVELI in these patients with PNH combined of course with remarkable efficacy that we showed in the trials as well as in the real world. What does that mean? There are more than 1,400 patient years of data available to us now. We have yet to see a first case of a meningococcal infection.</p><p>On C5 inhibitors, you should expect to see meningococcal infection every 200 patient years. Had I told you 10 years ago that we believed that our drug was going to be potentially safer than C5 inhibitors, nobody would have believed it. But by the mechanism by which pegcetacoplan works, these numbers are starting to look like that. Also with a very impressive thrombosis rate of only.51 events per 100 patient years. And then we had a third FDA approval not for a drug, but for a device, the EMPAVELI injector. This is something that dramatically improves the patient experience. So what it means is that you can take a vial and without having to manipulate any needles, you can self-administer this drug at home over the course of 30 to 45 minutes very comfortably and without too much hassle. This is of course important because we are going to see now the entry of the orals in PNH.</p><p>This is great for patients to have that available to them. But I think it's important to bear in mind that the convenience of taking a pill twice a day with a very strict pathology, I mean you can really not afford to lose a dose, right, versus something that you can do twice a week where you can have a day or two where you forget it or whatever, being more comfortable around that, we believe is going to be important. And especially with the convenience of this injector, we think we are well positioned to take on this competitive landscape. And then C3G and IC-MPGN. This is something that I'm personally incredibly excited about as you will see in the next couple of slides. These are diseases in which we're talking about adolescents, young adults that have a 50% chance of progressing to end stage renal disease or kidney transplantation over the course of five to 10 years. Think about that.</p><p>There are approximately 5,000 potential patients in the US between these two indications. And why are we so excited? Well, at the American Society for Nephrology meeting last year, which coincidentally was the same time as the ophthalmology meeting, which is why not a lot of people paid attention to it, but we presented these data from the 13 subjects that were treated in the so-called NOBLE study. And what we did there was take patients with these kidney diseases, take a biopsy before receiving pegcetacoplan, and then take a biopsy three months later. And what you see here is on the left panel C3 deposition in these glomeruli, which goes away over the course of three months. Why is this important? Because within these indications, C5 inhibitors very often get prescribed off-label. It's common to do because it does have an impact on for example proteinuria. But that C3 deposition never goes away and every nephrologist in this field knows that.</p><p>So when we presented this data at ASN, first of all what stood out was that in only 12 weeks we reduced disease activity, that we showed both in C3G and IC-MPGN that it correlated with the other key clinical measures and of course that it was again well tolerated. In the weeks after ASN, we receive -- every week we receive requests now for patients to be treated with this drug product even though of course we have to still read out the VALIANT trial. Speaking of which, this Phase III clinical study has enrolled 124 subject. It's fully enrolled. We'll have a readout in the middle of this year. We equally split this between an active and a placebo group over the course of 26 weeks, then an off-label period in which 26 weeks all patients receive the drug, followed up by an eight weeks washout or extension periods. The primary endpoint here is to look at a change in proteinuria at week 26 where the study's powered to show a 50% reduction.</p><p>This is something that we are really looking forward to and where again we think we will be able to make a major difference in the lives of these patients that currently have nothing available to them. And then there is of course the early pipeline and the Beam collaboration. So in the past couple of years, we've been very focused on our commercial products, the launch; but we have more things coming for you in this next year. Most notably the siRNA program, which is now in the dose escalation phase and on which you will receive data in the months to come; and then the gene editing program with Beam on which you should expect to see more this year as well. So to recap, our 2024 priorities are to reach more patients in the US with SYFOVRE, to bring SYFOVRE to patients globally with a focus on Europe initially, to maximize EMPAVELI in PNH and to broaden that into the indication of C3G and IC-MPGN, and to advance our early pipeline and the Beam collaboration.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><h>Questions And Answers</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Thanks, Cedric. Just want to remind the audience of a few things. So there are three ways to ask a question, right? Old school, right; raise your hand, I'll call on you. I guess new school, which is you can submit a question in the portal and it'll show up on this iPad. I don't know, like an intermediate school where you can like email me and I will ask your question. So with that, I just want to maybe talk about SYFOVRE. You guys beat consensus estimates this morning. What impacts have you seen from the implementation of the J code on the SYFOVRE growth on a weekly or monthly basis?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you, Anupam. So, the J code makes it easier for physicians to be paid for this product in this buy and build model that we implement and certainly has an impact especially on smaller practices as well as academic practices. But I think really that the numbers that we have shown in the fourth quarter are related to an important extent to the data that we presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Again that third year of dosing and the super impressive slowdown that we see on the disease progression, that is something that resonates with physicians. This is the only drug in geographic atrophy that has ever shown these types of effects by a factor of two and that is of course something that makes it a much easier decision for physicians and patients to make their decision. The other aspect is that the vasculitis has kind of a background side effect that can very rarely occur. It's also something that physicians now understand is not kind of the tip of an iceberg or something. It is well understood to be something that is very rare with the last confirmed case at this point still stemming back to September. It will happen again as it will with other drugs, but it is now much more considered to be something of life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Just quickly with Europe. Sorry, old school. Just with the European appeal, what do you think you could do differently once you appeal it and what data will you be able to show that gives you confidence that this isn't just the thing over time that you'll see it and that's what needs to play out, but the imaging that you'd be able to show that there is some improvement and there is -- this is not just a stepping stone?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>No, no, of course. I think look, I think through this process; and I mean I'm European I'm used to this, right; it's usually much more involved. I mean goes through multiple steps and I think the voice that was not really heard yet is the specialist voice. So, the way in which this process goes is initially kind of being more technical about these aspects and I believe -- I mean we hope that the physician voice will be heard in this appeal. I think we also have more data and we can kind of narrow in on aspects or patient populations potentially where the impact of the drug is very clearly seen. So we're hopeful, but there's no doubt that it will be an uphill battle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Maybe I'm expanding on the question. My understanding is pending a negative CHMP opinion, you will appeal and then you will get new repertoires, right? But you just mentioned about the physician appeal. Where does that process come into the regulatory discussions with the repertoires? Is there a committee? Like how does that work?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>No. I think what I tried to say about that is that there's just more time available to kind of really understand the impact on patients, the impact on physicians. And again I think just having a little bit more time in what is at the end of the day a very complex disease and a very complex way of measuring things, right? So European agency and that was always known wants to understand the functional impact and that is something that takes a lot of understanding and going through the process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience? I have an email question here. Can you talk a little bit about the next generation of compounds, one from Annexon where they recently disclosed a head to head study versus SYFOVRE looking particularly at sort of like 15 line declines?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So look, I mean it's good for patients when drugs get developed and we wish Annexon good luck with that. I think the challenge I believe is how do you explain the best corrected visual acuity benefit without kind of seeing the anatomical correlation to that? I think that is hard to understand also bearing in mind that the impact on BCVA of GA is very tenuous, right? You always go back to just a handful of patients where the lesions are close enough to the center to involve really that ability to read a chart and where lesions actually grow in the right direction. So look, let's see where it goes, but I think it will be a difficult study to run.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience? Okay. At AAL, you talked about the three-year GALE data. There did seem to be some amount of physicians still kind of on the sidelines when you watched the presentations and they showed the scans. How do you overcome that and what are the key levers for driving use in those that are still on the sidelines?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Data, transparency, and communication, right? So we have an amazing commercial and med affairs team. Especially our med affairs team is there to educate physicians in terms of understanding what is happening with this drug. Again it's complex, right? Understanding how this disease works, how this drug affected is complex. And with every new indication and every new drug, I mean it's always an uphill battle, but I think one that we have managed -- that our team has managed very well. In the months to come, we're going to keep on talking about these extraordinary reductions in lesion growth. We're going to keep on talking about the visual function benefits that we see especially as we go longer into GAIL and that's something that I think will resonate well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience? One other message that came out of AAO was actually interestingly the patient voice in this community as being a tailwind to adoption. What have you heard anecdotally from the marketplace?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>I think that the -- for me this is the most underappreciated aspect of this disease and that is the angst and the terror that patients with geographic atrophy go through as day by day, month by month, year by year they see their ability to function and their ability to see go down. These are patients that want to be treated. If you tell a patient there's a chance of one in 10,000 of something bad happening to your eye, I've yet to hear about a patient saying like oh, you know what, I'm not going to do anything and just let it go on its own. So, it kind of provides the context, right? I mean there are so many patients that go to retina doctors. Of course our DDC campaign with Henry Winkler that raises awareness helps with this as well. Patients come into the physician's office, they're like I'm desperate, I'm losing vision every day, what can this drug do for me? And it behooves, it's on us to explain to physicians what this drug exactly does for their patients. And that's the job that I think we've done particularly well and will continue to do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Questions from the audience?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>I have a question about macular atrophy, which is -- sorry. One question about macular atrophy, which is used for patients with wet AMD and for those patients, they typically receive anti-vegetative therapies. But after a few years, most of them develop macular atrophy. So, do you think macular atrophy is similar to geographic atrophy? So, is there any chance that your drug might be effective for macular atrophy? And have you heard any feedback from physicians about this?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>So nobody knows the answer to your question, right? So macular atrophy, as you correctly point out, is essentially imaging-wise the same as geographic atrophy. It typically affects the central portion of the retina more than the periphery. And there are a lot of patients that receive SYFOVRE that have macular atrophy as well. That was not separately done within the study, but it is from an imaging perspective, this is geographic atrophy. So whether there's a difference or not is something that we'll find out over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Any final questions on SYFOVRE before maybe we switch gears? Okay. There's one more. Oh, yeah.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unidentified Participant:</emphasis></p><p>Just as we parse out what non-US, non-Europe markets there are, which of them -- let's just say that Europe doesn't go your way, what material markets can choose either the FDA or the EMA to reference and still forge on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>So, there are ways for patients to have access to this drug outside of the US already now, right? I mean it's just that at that point in time kind of paying for that drug becomes a bigger challenge, but those paths are available in a majority of countries globally already.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Any final questions on SYFOVRE? Maybe switching gears then to EMPAVELI. So, what are some of the key growth drivers that we should be thinking about for EMPAVELI in PNH in '24?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>So I think first of all in PNH, it's going to be important to maintain our patients on drug and in that sense our research so far has been very good. I mean patients that are stable with EMPAVELI with PNH are very happy with this drug. Kind of switching over with what is at the end of the day a potentially lethal disease towards an oral product is not something that is very appealing. I think in the treatment naive segments, that's of course going to be challenging, right? If you're offered with a pill versus an injection, that is going to be a stiff competitive landscape for us. But again the safety profile that this drug has really stands out.</p><p>So I think in PNH, there continues to be an important growth opportunity. But in IC-MPGN and in C3G, I think that is really where we see something beautiful coming around. I think in a post transplant setting especially when you have these diseases and you have received a transplanted kidney where we have histopath data showing very clear and objective evidence that you can have a disease modifying impact on this, that is where I think we're going to be able to do something special where the value proposition is incredibly easy, where the impact on the disease looks very promising, where we already have histopath data, and we're in the VALIANT study. We're going to be able to further interrogate that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>So on IC-MPGN and C3G you've got the Phase III data coming later this year. Like remind us of what are the key endpoints and kind of how you would define a win scenario?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Yeah. So, we look at a 50% reduction in UPCR, right? So that is albuminuria is something that has had its history in the past, but we have pre-discussed this with the FDA as we ran this trial. So, this is a trial where we feel very comfortable and confident that should we meet the primary endpoints with supportive elements around it that we will get an approval for this drug in C3G and IC-MPGN.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anupam Rama:</emphasis></p><p>Any final questions? Okay. Thanks, everyone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cedric Francois:</emphasis></p><p>Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALPANT-7fe5e20786de5aac9beb14f8ef95193a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALPANT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GTM-9433-RSMP-902P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">494744</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024AlphaStreet Inc., All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Alphastreet, Inc. - Earnings and Conference Call Transcripts</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"65767\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 8, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC000DM10</classCode><className>APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Now if only Uncle Sam would get onboard with tax credits, too.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A year ago, Merritt Jenkins moved from Boston to Twain Harte, California, a speck of 2,500 souls in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. On his morning commute, he stops at Alicia's Sugar Shack for a breakfast sandwich (scrambled eggs on rye with avocado), then heads to a 10-acre patch of woods in the Stanislaus National Forest. There, his startup, Kodama Systems, is testing and perfecting its 25-foot-long, 17-ton semiautonomous timber harvesting machine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Loggers use such machines, known as skidders, to grab tons of cut trees and debris and drag them out of the woods. Kodama's version is designed to do the job even at night, with fewer workers, using satellite connectivity and advanced lidar (light detection and ranging) cameras, the same type that are used on self-driving cars, to monitor the work remotely. It isn't easy. \"There's a lot of texture to the trees. Every 10 feet of skid trail is slightly different,\" says Jenkins, 35.</p><p>But logging in the dark isn't the most intriguing part of the plans at Kodama, which has raised $6.6 million in seed funding from Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy and others. After cutting down the trees, Jenkins plans to bury them--to help slow climate change and to reap salable carbon offsets (and maybe, someday, tax credits too).</p><p>Yes, the conventional idea is to plant trees to soak up carbon dioxide from the air and to then sell credits to corporations, private jet owners and others who need or want to offset their emissions. But scientists say burying trees can reduce global warming as well--particularly if those trees would otherwise end up burning or decaying, spewing their stored carbon into the air.</p><p>California's enormous 2020 wildfires drove home the risks to air, property and life posed by overgrown forests. \"The orange skies in San Francisco were an inflection point. Now the story resonates,\" says Jimmy Voorhis, head of biomass utilization and policy at Kodama. The alarm bells are sounding even louder this year as Canadian wildfires have spread dangerous air conditions to New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago.</p><p>To help address the problem, the U.S. Forest Service aims to thin out 70 million acres of western forests, mostly in California, over the next decade, extracting more than 1 billion tons of bone-dry biomass. It is customary, after such forest thinning, for logs of marketable size to go to sawmills, with most of the rest piled up and later burned under controlled conditions. Kodama wants to bury the leftovers instead--in earthen vaults designed to maintain dry and anoxic (oxygen-free) conditions and protect the wood from rotting or burning.</p><p>Along with the VC seed money, Kodama has already received $1.1 million in grants from California's forest fire agency and others, as well as purchase commitments for the carbon credits tied to the first 400 tons of trees it buries. On the open market, those credits should fetch $200 a ton. Eventually Kodama wants to cut down and bury more than 5,000 tons of trees a year.</p><p>A Dartmouth grad with degrees in both engineering and environmental studies, Jenkins started selling used robotic equipment while earning a master's in robotics at Carnegie Mellon. Then he cofounded a company that uses machine learning to help farmers analyze soil. But in 2019, while earning an MBA at MIT, he concluded there was more opportunity in forestry than in the crowded ag-tech field. He backed away from the AI company and spent months with loggers to understand how they use equipment, and by 2021 had settled on forestry robotics, convinced that labor shortages would drive demand. \"There's not enough workforce,\" he says. \"We'll need new training and new technologies\" to meet the Forest Service's clearing goals.</p><p>He also saw another \"big gap\" in the industry: what to do with all that biomass. He had heard about biomass vaults from Yale's Carbon Containment Lab. Then mutual friends introduced him to Voorhis, a 33-year-old mountaineer, geologist and earth sciences engineer (with an M.S. from Dartmouth), who had become obsessed with the idea of reclaiming old mines as biomass burial sites. They joined forces.</p><p>The notion of burying trees sounds simple and low-tech, particularly when compared with the convoluted \"carbon capture\" technology now being developed to pull CO2 from the air. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act Democrats passed in 2022, companies like Occidental Petroleum and ExxonMobil could qualify for tax credits of $85 per ton of CO2 sequestered if they can perfect systems to suck the gas directly from the air and transport it by pipeline before injecting it permanently underground. The IRA further incentivizes some of these projects with tax credits equal to 30% or more of upfront capital invested. </p><p>If you want to cut down trees and pelletize them to burn in place of coal, there are tax credits for that too. But not, as of now, for burying them.</p><p>\"If you need to remove carbon at scale, it's crazy not to learn from nature or harness nature,\" says Lucas Joppa, a former chief environmental officer at Microsoft who is now at Haveli Investments. \"We've never come remotely close to being as efficient at removing carbon from the atmosphere as evolution has.\"</p><p>How efficient? University of Maryland atmospheric science professor Ning Zeng, considered the godfather of biomass burial, explains that the average ton of freshly harvested forest is about 50% carbon by weight, and if left to rot or burn it would put the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A good rule of thumb, he says: \"A ton of biomass in the Earth is a ton of CO2 not in the sky.\"</p><p>Zeng has his own startup, Carbon Lockdown, which has a contract with the city of Baltimore to pick up 5,000 tons of biomass and bury it near wealthy, leafy Potomac, Maryland. He's selling the carbon credits generated by that burial at $181 per sequestered ton on Puro.earth (a platform that was built with backing from the Finnish government and became majority-owned by Nasdaq in 2021). Swedish investment company Kinnevik recently bought 1,000 tons. \"Nature-based technologies are here and scalable,\" says Mikaela Kramer, who oversees carbon credit purchases for Kinnevik. \"It doesn't have to wait another 10 years.\"</p><p>Still, it's tough to get large-scale private or government investment in biomass burial because it's neither replacing a climate-destroying industrial activity nor creating a product that's of use to people--other than the credits themselves. It also can mean disturbing land.</p><p>In Texas, attorney Chris Knop, 43, has already interred more than 4,000 tons of biomass on 45 acres of land his company, Carbon Sequestration, owns near the Louisiana border. The land there is ideal for the anoxic burial required to prevent biomass from decomposing, he says, because of its thick layer of clay. He recently acquired 15,000 tons of debris from landowners north of Beaumont, who are clearing pine forest for real estate development and would otherwise have burned it, enabling him to sell carbon credits for $145 a ton on Puro.</p><p>Knop thinks he can break even and was counting on federal tax credits to make the venture profitable. But Congress didn't explicitly include biomass burial in its tax-credit bonanza. Now Knop and biomass lobbyists are hoping that when the Treasury writes final rules for carbon sequestration credits, biomass will qualify. \"I'm just looking for some type of affirmation,\" he says. </p><p>Knop also has an out-there vision for turning America's forestlands into carbon sponges by chopping down pine trees, burying them and then replanting with more carbon-thirsty species like bamboo, kenaf or poplar. In the U.S., hundreds of millions of acres are dedicated to cattle grazing or timber production, he says. \"Why not switch to carbon farming?\"</p><p>Back at Kodama, Jenkins is focused on burying wood that needs to be culled anyway for forest health, while Voorhis is aiming to adapt defunct mines and quarries--rather than dig new land--for biomass storage. \"We will measure the gas and leachate and completely box off the carbon flows,\" Voorhis promises. \"If you meet anyone with an old inert rock quarry, let me know.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOW TO PLAY IT</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By William Baldwin</emphasis></p><p>Grow a tree and then bury it? What a waste! The rational place to store carbon is above ground. The wood could be the two-by-six studs in a house or the laminated beams in a commercial building, and it spares the planet CO2 emissions from steel and concrete. Participate in this environmentally virtuous business by owning shares in forest products companies, such as West Fraser Timber in Canada and Stora Enso in Finland. Earnings will be down this year as homebuilding pauses, but the trees are still growing, and the dividend yields (1.4% and 5%) continue. Recover some or all of the foreign withholding taxes on dividends via a credit on your U.S. return.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">William Baldwin is Forbes' Investment Strategies columnist.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Bunyan 2.0 </emphasis></p><p>After thinning trees up to 60 feet tall, Kodama will inter them on more arid land outside the forest. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Little Big Picture</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WOOD WORK </emphasis></p><p>America has plenty of trees--nearly 300 billion of them, according to the U.S. Forest Service's \"tree census.\" Good thing, since wood products are used in a variety of products including cigarette filters and Parmesan cheese.

He on Sunday said that such fire incidents were causing huge financial loss to nation, depriving the effectees from their livelihood, subjecting the life and properties of the inhabitant at high risk, destroying the local fauna and flora, besides contributing in worsening the negative effects of climate change. The President has observed that most of the forest fire incidents are preventable as 85 percent of wild land fires are caused when the campfires and burning debris are left unattended, equipment use and malfunctions, negligently discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson. </p><p>He has further said that regrettably, the wild fire disturbs the population of flora and fauna, eliminates the wild animals, destroys the habitats of birds and harms the fertility of the soil which hampers the growth and composition of vegetation, besides increasing the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases. He said that most of the wildfire incident could be prevented by taking simple precautions which included reporting unattended fires to the authorities, extinguishing fire pits and campfires when done, not throwing lit cigarettes out of your moving car, using caution when using flammable liquids and using fireworks in clear areas with no woods nearby. The president advised the concerned authorities to refocus on prevention of wildfire strategies by strengthening coordination across sectors to reduce incidents of wildfire, investing in both fire suppression and prevention, implementing existing fire management techniques, improving wildfire data collection and analysis and by strengthening stakeholders' coordination and preparedness.</p><p>PREVIOUS NEXT</p><p>ABOUT US</p><p>Press Information Department is the principal department of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, headed by Principal Information officer (PIO).

Welcome, everyone, to the 42nd Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. My name is Anupam Rama. I am one of the senior biotech analysts here at JPMorgan. I'm joined by my squad, Malcolm Kuno, Priyanka Grover, [Gloria Hall].</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our next presenting company is Apellis. And presenting on behalf of the company, we have CEO, Cedric Francois.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CEDRIC FRANCOIS, CO-FOUNDER, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.: Thank you so much, Anupam, and thank you for inviting us again to speak here. It's great to see many familiar faces. Let's dive straight into what is a special year that we have in front of us after 2023, which all of you know had quite a bit of tumultuous events in it. I will be making some forward-looking statements.</p><p>And I want to start off with this slide, which reminds us of what we really do at Apellis, where we combine courageous science with compassion. And that has resulted in 2 approved drugs since our time when we went public in 2017, Empaveli and SYFOVRE.</p><p>Empaveli, as a reminder, was the very first therapy to target complement factor C3. And as you all know, has done very well in PNH as the first and leading indication. SYFOVRE was the first treatment available for the leading cause -- for the leading cause of blindness in geographic atrophy approved in February of last year. In the meantime, we have a pipeline that is growing, focused on complement and specifically the special target of C3.</p><p>So for 2024, we have 4 priorities. Number one is to maximize access to SYFOVRE to patients in need in this country. Secondly, we aim to bring SYFOVRE to patients with geographic atrophy worldwide. Of course, in the European Union, we've had a little hiccup. We're going to continue to work diligently towards an approval there as well. Third, we aim to maximize Empaveli in PNH and then to expand in this new indication in C3G and IC-MPGN, 2 important kidney indications that are rare, but very important in terms of unmet need for which no therapies again, are approved at this point. And then we have our early pipeline and our collaboration with beam on which you should expect to hear much more this year as well.</p><p>So let's dive right in, first of all, into geographic atrophy. So what is geographic atrophy. I'd like to make the comparison to a forest fire in your retina, where patients that have this disease are on a relentless progression towards blindness where more and more retinal cells are lost. More than 1 million patients in the U.S. are affected by this disease, more than 5 million patients globally. And to give you a sense of what this disease really means, nearly 7 in 10 people with geographic atrophy believe that the impact on independence and quality of life due to this disease is actually worse than they had expected at the start of their diagnosis.</p><p>This is a really important health problem, affects elderly people with what is arguably their greatest source of joy towards the end of their lives and something where we feel we have a great responsibility to contribute to slow that disease down.</p><p>Then this morning, we announced the Q4 numbers. We had $114 million in sale in the fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter, we had $275 million over the first 10 months of the launch, making this one of the strongest launches in the past 10 years in our industry. During that period, 160,000 vials were distributed, of which we believe approximately 150,000 were administered to patients.</p><p>So here we are with SYFOVRE being the market-leading treatment for GA in the U.S., with approximately 95% of patients in this country being treated with SYFOVRE within that market segment. And that is because this is a drug that shows more efficacy over time, where we have more experience and where we can create more vision for patients.</p><p>So let's start with what more efficacy means. This is a drug with a very unique feature. And that is the fact that patients with geographic atrophy that go on treatment. The longer they are on treatment, the more profound, the slowdown and the loss of photoreceptor cells is. So when you have patients with what we call nonsubfoveal lesions which are the patients that we believe can probably benefit most from this treatment. In the third year, the slowdown of the degenerative process is 42%. That means when you are affected by this disease, you have an opportunity to slow down the loss of these photoreceptor cells almost in half, something really important that we see both with monthly as well as with every other month treatment.</p><p>And then I want to take a brief moment to look at this slide. We all know what happened in the summer of last year. I mean in the real world, things like that can happen. This particular extremely rare finding is one to which physicians in the retina space are sensitive. But it is one where we made a determination in the summer of last year to hold physicians by their hands to be fully transparent and to guide them through that and make them understand that this was and continues to be an extremely rare phenomenon, which by the way, affects also other complement inhibitors in this area as well as anti-VEGF agents.</p><p>It was all a matter of kind of going through it and making sure that we were fully transparent through the process. I can tell you that since I've had the privilege of leading this company, I've never been prouder of the team that we have and the integrity with which this was done. So here we are, 95% of total patient share more than 150,000 injections, double-digit numbers of new sites, each week's strong access and reimbursement. And this growth, which is now again on a track where it was in the spring. And you have a little dip, of course, because of Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. This last week, we had our biggest day by far since the launch as well.</p><p>So this is a drug that we believe is there to stay, to be available to these patients with this devastating disease. And what does this mean for vision? So we always get the question, okay, this drug slows down the degenerative process. Why don't you show a functional improvement? The problem in geographic atrophy is that showing a functional improvement in any disease in the retina is very difficult to do, and takes a long period of time and takes a lot of patience because we do not have the tools to do it.</p><p>Now thankfully, in the OAKS trial, we did have a tool that is intensive takes a lot of time, but we did it in all of these subjects called microperimetry. And what we do there is we use a laser, and we individually interrogate 68 dots in the retina for light sensitivity. And when we do that, we get a pretty good picture of what goes on. Now within this context, you could argue that the 4 central dots within that grid are the ones that are most important for things like reading, like recognizing faces. It is what contributes to the central vision, which is the one that you use when you read, for example, is not in chart at your optometrist, right?</p><p>So when we analyze these 4 central dots in the microperimetry, the results that we get is, first of all, an association with that best corrected visual acuity, that central vision, where patients that lose all of these 4 central dots have about a [line more] loss overall than patients that do not. And when you do that analysis, you see clear correlation to that functional improvement in patients from monthly as well as every other month. This is, by the way, something that can be repeated when you take the central 16 points as well.</p><p>The feedback from physicians has been overwhelmingly positive. I think especially in the last summer, when we went through what we went being able to communicate, being able to tell physicians and patients over time, how this was being updated, continuously being there with our Chief Medical Officer, Caroline Baumal, who's sitting here with us guiding us through that, has been really rewarding. And the retina community at large right now has trust and confidence. And that is something that I think was essential in the summer of last year and which contributed to our very impressive recovery.</p><p>Okay. Then SYFOVRE ex U.S. What does this mean for patients ex U.S.? Just in Europe, more than 2.5 million patients are affected by this disease. There are no approved treatments available outside of the U.S., as was the case before February last year here as well, and 84% of European eye care professionals are convinced that early GA treatment is essential.</p><p>As most of you know, we had a hiccup in that process in Europe, mostly based on the fact that the functional analysis that we have in DERBY and OAKS are post hoc analysis. Again, going back to the point that we made earlier, there is a reason while measuring photoreceptor cell loss anatomically is the primary endpoint in all of these studies is because we can actually very easily measure it. Correlating it to function requires post hoc analysis, and that requires a lot of education, a lot of eye care feedback. And that is what we are going to go through now.</p><p>At the end of this month, we will have a negative opinion from the CHMP. We will appeal that. And then in the second quarter of 2024, we will have a final answer. Now there is no doubt that this will be an uphill process, but one that we are firmly committed to for the benefit of patients and physicians.</p><p>Then moving on to Empaveli in PNH and C3G IC-MPGN. So Empaveli continues to elevate the standard of care in PNH. We had $91 million in sales last year with $24 million in the last quarter. And importantly, since we have the PRINCE -- naive, the PRINCE trial treatment-naive data included as well now, 10% of demand in 2023 was from those treatment-naive patients. So really kind of stepping into that first-line concept.</p><p>We also have 97% patient compliance rates. There's not a lot of drugs that can show numbers like this. And that is, of course, correlated to the following: that we have an unprecedented safety profile for Empaveli in these patients with PNH combined, of course, with remarkable efficacy that we showed in the trials as well as in the real world.</p><p>What does that mean? There are more than 1,400 patient years of data available to us now. We have yet to see a first case of meningococcal infection. On C5 inhibitors, you should expect to see meningococcal infection every 200 patient years. Had I told you 10 years ago that we believed that our drug was going to be potentially safer than C5 inhibitors, nobody would have believed it. But by the mechanism by which pegcetacoplan works, these numbers are starting to look like that. Also with a very impressive thrombosis rate of only 0.51 events per 100 patient years.</p><p>And then we had a third FDA approval, not for a drug, but for a device in the Empaveli injector. This is something that dramatically improves the patient experience. So what it means is that you can take the vial and without having to manipulate any needles, you can self-administer this drug at home over the course of 30 to 45 minutes very comfortably and without too much hassle. This is, of course, important because we are going to see now the entry of the orals in PNH. This is great for patients to have that available to them, but I think it's important to bear in mind that the convenience of taking a pill twice a day with a very strict posology. I mean you can really not afford to lose a dose, right, versus something that you can do twice a week, where you can have a day or two where you forget it or whatever being more comfortable around that we believe is going to be important. And especially with this -- with the convenience of this injector, we think we are well positioned to take on this competitive landscape.</p><p>And then C3G and IC-MPGN. This is something that I'm personally incredibly excited about, as you will see in the next couple of slides. These are diseases in which we're talking about adolescents, young adults that are -- that have a 50% chance of progressing to end-stage renal disease or kidney transplantation over the course of 5 to 10 years, think about that.</p><p>There are approximately 5,000 potential patients in the U.S. between these 2 indications. And why are we so excited? Well, at the American Society for Nephrology meeting last year, which co-incidentally was at the same time as the ophthalmology meeting, which is why not a lot of people paid attention to it, but we presented these data from the 13 subjects that were treated in the so-called NOBLE study. And what we did there was take patients with these kidney diseases, take a biopsy before receiving pegcetacoplan and then take a biopsy 3 months later.</p><p>And what you see here is on the left panel, C3 deposition in the glomeruli, which goes away over the course of 3 months. And why is this important? Because within these indications, C5 inhibitors very often get prescribed off-label. It's common to do because it does have an impact on, for example, proteinuria, but that C3 deposition never goes away. And every nephrologist in this field knows that.</p><p>So when we presented this data at ASN, first of all, what stood out was that in only 12 weeks, we reduced disease activity that we showed that both in C3G and IC-MPGN that is correlated with the other key clinical measures and, of course, that it was again well tolerated. In the weeks after ASN, every week we receive requests now for patients to be treated with this drug product, even though, of course, we have to still read out the Valiant trial, speaking of which, this Phase III clinical study has enrolled 124 subjects. It's fully enrolled. We'll have a readout in the middle of this year. We equally split this between an active and a placebo group over the course of 26 weeks. Then an off-label period in which 26 weeks, all patients received the drug, follow up by 8 weeks washout or extension periods.</p><p>The primary endpoint here is to look at the change in proteinuria at week 26, where the study is powered to show a 50% reduction. This is something that we are really looking forward to and where, again, we think we will be able to make a major difference in the lives of these patients that currently have nothing available to them.</p><p>And then there is, of course, the early pipeline and the beam collaboration. So in the past couple of years, we've been very focused on our commercial products, the launch, but we have more things coming for you in this next year. Most notably the siRNA program, which is now in the dose escalation phase on which you will receive data in the months to come. And then the gene editing program with Beam on which you should expect to see more this year as well.</p><p>So to recap, our 2024 priorities are to reach more patients in the U.S. with SYFOVRE to bring SYFOVRE to patients globally with a focus on Europe initially to maximize Empaveli in PNH and to broaden that into the indication of C3G and IC-MPGN and to advance our early pipeline and the Beam collaboration.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Thanks, Cedric. I just want to remind the audience of a few things. So there are 3 ways to ask a question, right? Old school, right? Raise your hand, I'll call on you. I guess new school, which is you can submit a question in the portal, and I'll show up on this iPad. I don't know, like an intermediate school where you can like e-mail to me, and I will ask your question.</p><p>So with that, I just want to maybe just talk about SYFOVRE. You guys' big consensus estimates this morning. What impacts have you seen from the implementation of the J-code on the SYFOVRE growth on a weekly or a monthly basis?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. Thank you, Anupam. So look, the J-code makes it easier for physicians to be paid for this product in this buy-and-bill model that we implement. And certainly has an impact, especially on smaller practices as well as academic practices.</p><p>But I think really that the numbers that we have shown in the fourth quarter are related to an important extent to the data that we presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Again, that third year of dosing and the super impressive slowdown that we see on the disease progression. That is something that resonates with physicians. This is the only drug in geographic atrophy that has ever shown these types of effects by a factor of 2. And that is, of course, something that makes it a much easier decision for physicians and patients to make their decision.</p><p>The other aspect is that the vasculitis as kind of a background side effect that can very rarely occur is also something that physicians now understand is not kind of the tip of an iceberg or something. It is well understood to be something that is very rare with the last confirmed case at this point, still stemming back to September. It will happen again as it will with other drugs, but it is now much more considered to be something of life.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just with the European appeal -- what do you think you could do differently once you appeal? And what data will you be able to show that gives you confidence that this isn't just over time that you'll see it, and that's what needs to play out, but the imaging that you'd be able to show that there is some improvement? And there is -- this is not just a stepping stone?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: No, no, of course. I think look, I think through this process, I mean, I'm European, I'm used to this, right? It's usually much more involved. I mean, it goes through multiple steps. And I think the voice that was not really heard yet is the specialist voice. So the way in which this process goes is initially kind of being more technical about these aspects. And I believe -- I mean, we hope that the physician voice will be heard in this appeal. I think we also have more data and we can kind of narrow in on aspects or patient populations potentially where the impact of the drug is very clearly seen.</p><p>So we're hopeful, but there's no doubt that it will be an uphill battle.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Maybe expanding on the question, my understanding is pending a negative CHMP opinion, you will appeal and then you will get new repertoires, right?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Of course.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: And -- but you just mentioned about the physician appeal. Where does that process come into the regulatory discussions? Is it with the repertoires? Is there a committee, like how does that work?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: No. I think what I tried to say about that is that there's just more time available to kind of really understand the impact on patients, the impact on physicians. And again, I think just having a little bit more time in what is at the end of the day, a very complex disease and a very complex way of measuring things, right? So European agency, and that's not -- that was always known, wants to understand the functional impact and that is something that takes a lot of understanding and going through the process.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? I have an e-mail question here. Can you talk a little bit about the next generation of compounds, one from Annexon where they recently disclosed a head-to-head study versus SYFOVRE, looking particularly at sort of like [15-line] declines?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So look, I mean, it's good for patients when drugs get developed and we wish Annexon good luck with that. I think the challenge, I believe, is how do you explain the best corrected visual acuity benefit without kind of seeing the anatomical correlation to that. I think that is hard to understand. Also bearing in mind that the impact on BCVA of GA is very tenuous, right? You always go back to just a handful of patients, where the lesions are close enough to the center to involve really that ability to read a chart and where the lesions actually grow in the right direction. So look, let's see where it goes, but I think it will be a difficult study to run.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? Okay. At AAO, you talked about the 3-year GALE data. There did seem to be some amount of physicians still kind of on the sidelines when you watch the presentations and they showed the scans and how do you overcome that? And what are the key levers to driving use in those that are still on the sidelines?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Data, transparency and communication, right? So we have an amazing commercial and med affairs team that -- especially our med affairs team is there to educate physicians in terms of understanding what is happening with this drug. Again, it's complex, right? Understanding how this disease works, how this drug affected is complex. And with every new indication and every new drug, I mean, it's always an uphill battle, but I think one that we have managed -- that our team has managed very well.</p><p>In the months to come, we're going to keep on talking about these extraordinary reductions in lesion growth. We're going to keep on talking about the visual function benefits that we see, especially as you go longer into GALE and that's something that I think will resonate well.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience? One other message that came out of AAO was actually, interestingly, the patient voice in this community as being a tailwind to adoption. What have you heard anecdotally from the marketplace?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Well, I think that the -- for me, this is the most underappreciated aspect of this disease. And that is the angst and the terror that patients with geographic atrophy go through, as day by day, month by month, year by year, they see their ability to function and their ability to see go down. These are patients that want to be treated. If you tell a patient, there's a chance of 1 in 10,000 of something bad happening to your eye, I've yet to hear about the patient saying like, \"Oh, you know what, I'm not going to do anything and just let it go on its own.\"</p><p>So it kind of provides the context, right? I mean there are so many patients that go to retina doctors. Of course, our (inaudible) Campaign with Henry Winkler that raises awareness helps with this as well. Patients come in to the physician's office, they're like, \"I'm desperate. I'm losing vision every day. What can this drug do for me/\" And it's on us to explain to physicians what this drug exactly does for their patients. And that's a job that I think we've done particularly well, and we'll continue to do.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Questions from the audience?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. One question about macular atrophy which is used for patients with wet AMD. And for those patients, they typically receive anti-VEGF therapies. But after a few years, most of them develop macular atrophy. So do you think macular atrophy is similar to geographic atrophy. So is there any chance that your drug might be effective for macular atrophy? And have you heard any feedback from physicians about this?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So nobody knows the answer to your question, right? So macular atrophy, as you correctly point out, is essentially imagingwise the same as geographic atrophy. It typically affects the central portion of the retina more than the periphery. And there are a lot of patients that receive SYFOVRE that have macular atrophy as well. That was not separately done within the study, but it is from an imaging perspective, this is geographic atrophy. So whether there's a difference or not is something that we'll find out over time.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Any final questions on SYFOVRE before maybe we switch gears?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Just as we parse out what non-U.S., non-Europe markets there are, which of them, let's just say that Europe doesn't go your way? What material markets can choose either the FDA or the EMA to reference and still forge on.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: So there are ways for patients to have access to this drug outside of the U.S. already now, right? I mean it's just that at this point -- at that point in time, kind of paying for that drug becomes a bigger challenge, but those paths are available in the majority of countries, globally already.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Any final questions on SYFOVRE?? Maybe switching gears then to Empaveli. So what are some of the key growth drivers that we should be thinking about for Empaveli in PNH in '24?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. I think first of all, in PNH, it's going to be important to maintain our patients on drug. And in that sense, our research so far has been very good. I mean patients that are stable with Empaveli with PNH are very happy with this drug, kind of switching over with what is at the end of the day, a potentially lethal disease towards an oral product is not something that is very appealing. I think, in the treatment-naive segment, that's, of course, going to be challenging, right? If you're offered with a pill versus an injection, that is going to be a stiff competitive landscape for us. But again, the safety profile of this drug really stands out. So I think in PNH, there continues to be an important growth opportunity. But in IC-MPGN and C3G, I think that is really where we see something beautiful coming around.</p><p>I think in a post-transplant setting especially, when you have these diseases, and you have received a transplanted kidney where we have histopath data showing very clear and objective evidence that you can have a disease-modifying impact on this, that is where I think we're going to be able to do something special, where the value proposition is incredibly easy where the impact on the disease looks very promising, where we already have histopath data and we're in the Valiant study, we're going to be able to further interrogate that.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: So on IC-MPGN and C3G, you've got the Phase III data coming later this year. Like remind us of what are the key endpoints and kind of how you define a win scenario?</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Yes. So we look at a 50% reduction in UPCR, right? So that is -- albuminuria is something that has had its history in the past. But we have pre-discussed this with the FDA as we run this trial. So this is a trial where we feel very comfortable and confident that should we meet the primary endpoint with supportive elements around it, that we will get an approval for this drug in C3G and IC-MPGN.</p><p>ANUPAM RAMA: Any final questions? Okay. Thanks, everyone.</p><p>CEDRIC FRANCOIS: Thank you.</p><p>[Refinitiv, an LSEG business, reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

According to news reporting out of Siping, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"High temperature targets (temperature above 500 K), are the special on the surface of the earth such as forest fire, prairie fire, oil well torches, heap coking, volcanic eruptions, significantly different from those of normal surfaces at lower temperatures. Identification of high-temperature targets plays an important role in environmental monitoring, disaster warning, and resource investigation.\" </p><p><br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Jilin Normal University: \"In remote sensing data, high-temperature target pixels and bands are studied. And they are deemed samples and variables, respectively, in multivariate analysis. And classification of samples for identification of high-temperature targets is necessary. To classify samples, feature analysis of spectrum needs to be done first. In feature analysis of spectrum, feature bands that can be used to distinguish samples need to be selected. Correspondence analysis is the method that can project samples and variables into the same factor space in the meantime. It can realize the classification of samples and variables synchronously, and the results can be interpreted by each other. First, the correspondence analysis is conducted on Landsat8/OLI remote sensing imagery to build the relationship between samples and variables. After that the correspondence relationship between identification results of high-temperature targets and feature bands can be built in the physical theory of remote sensing and factors which have indicative significance on fire are confirmed.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Finally, the single band threshold method is adopted to realize high temperature target recognition by using factor scores. In the field confirmation, results suggest that the precision of identification of high-temperature targets reaches 92%. And we also get a consistent result with SWIR temperature inversion.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Identification of high-temperature targets in remote sensing based on correspondence analysis.

Doug LaMalfa, R-California, issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R - Richvale) participated in a House Committee on Agriculture hearing titled, \"A 2022 Review of the Farm Bill: Energy - Renewable Energy Opportunities in Rural America\". This hearing examined the 2018 Farm Bill energy programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA provides several grant and loan opportunities for agriculture-based renewable energy programs, including biofuels (ethanol) and biomass.</p><p>There are five major sources of renewable energy: solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass, and hydropower. As of 2020, these renewable energy sources provided approximately 12% of the total U.S. energy consumption, including 20% of the total U.S. electricity generation.</p><p>\"Energy independence is vital to our national security. America needs to embrace an energy policy that supports every type, from natural gas and oil drilling to nuclear and every reasonable renewable. We cannot simply declare that some methods of power generation are off limits. Energy production of all kinds has been important for rural economies; providing jobs, farm income, and tax revenue.</p><p>California is the leading state in biomass production, and it's very important for the North State. We have millions of tons of waste biomass sitting on our forest floors- dry, decomposing, and waiting to be part of the next catastrophic forest fire. By converting forest waste to domestic energy, we help prevent debris buildup and keep our forests healthy, curtail wildfires, strengthen energy independence, and create thousands of local jobs at each step of the process. Biomass is a win-win-win for everyone,\" said Congressman LaMalfa.</p><p>Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California's First Congressional District, including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7799980 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7799980</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:655F-4461-JC11-11M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"333\"/><timeReceived>8:11 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 6, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Meanwhile, a network of fire guards, sprinklers and water cannons was being established to try to protect the city from the fire, which had moved to within 9 miles.</p><p>\"We've still got some really difficult days ahead. There's no denying that,\" said Fire information officer Mike Westwick. He said winds from the north and northwest predicted for Friday and Saturday could \"push the fires in directions we don't want them to go.\"</p><p>Gas stations that still had fuel were open Friday morning, though the city was virtually empty, with one grocery store, a pharmacy and a bar still open.</p><p>\"It's kind of like having a pint at the end of the world,\" said Kieron Testart, who went door-to-door in the nearby First Nation communities of Dettah and NDilo to check on people. Indigenous communities have been hit hard by the wildfires, which threaten important cultural activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering native plants.</p><p>Hundreds of miles south of Yellowknife, homes were burning in West Kelowna, British Columbia, a city of about 38,000, after a wildfire grew \"exponentially worse\" than expected overnight, the fire chief said.</p><p>Residents had already been ordered to evacuate 2,600 properties, while another 4,800 properties were on evacuation alert. The BC Wildfire Service said the fire grew six times larger overnight and it stretches over 26 square miles.</p><p>Some first responders became trapped rescuing people who failed to evacuate, said Jason Brolund, chief of the West Kelowna fire department, who said residents face another \"scary night.\" There was no known loss of life.</p><p>Fire officials said that there was \"significant structural loss\" in a West Kelowna neighborhood on Thursday night although they had no count for the number of buildings destroyed. Houses remained under threat or on fire late Friday morning.</p><p>\"It was a devastating night,\" Chief Brolund told reporters. \"We fought a hundred years of fires all in one night.\"</p><p>Chief Brolund said that at some points police officers who had been ordering people to evacuate became trapped by the fire and had to be rescued. Other people went into nearby lakes to avoid the fire.</p><p>In Yellowknife, northwest winds combined with minimal rain were complicating efforts to slow the fire - one of hundreds raging in the territories - which could reach the city limits by the weekend, emergency officials said. There was a chance of limited rain on Friday, but officials said it likely wouldn't be enough to stop the fire.</p><p>\"We're heading into a critical couple of days,\" Shane Thompson, a government minister for the Territories, told a news conference.</p><p>Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty said the fire didn't advance as much as expected on Thursday, but \"it is still coming,\" and heavy smoke that is expected to move in increases the urgency of evacuating while it's still possible.</p><p>Officials said roads would stay open and flights would continue past the noon deadline as long as it is safe, though they worry access could be cut off if the fire advances.</p><p>Alice Liske left Yellowknife by road with her six kids earlier this week because the air quality was so bad. She worried about how so many people would flee the city in such a short time.</p><p>\"Not only that,\" she said, \"but when we go back, what will be there for us?\"</p><p>Canada has seen a record number of wildfires this year - contributing to choking smoke in parts of the U.S. - with more than 5,700 fires burning more than 53,000 square miles from one end of Canada to the other, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>As of Friday morning, more than 1,000 wildfires were burning across the country, over half of them out of control.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with his incident response group Thursday. He asked ministers to work to ensure communication services remained available and said there would be no tolerance for price gouging on flights or essential goods.</p><p>Federal Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez said Friday that all commercial airlines have added more flights from Yellowknife, and that the government was contracting private aircraft to supplement military flights.</p><p>About 6,800 people in eight other communities in the territory have already had to evacuate their homes, including the small community of Enterprise, which was largely destroyed. Officials said everyone made it out alive.</p><p>Mr. Rodriguez told a news conference that the decision by Meta to block news from Facebook users' feeds in Canada had hindered the ability of residents of Yellowknife to be informed about the evacuation. The technology company took the step after Canada passed legislation requiring Meta to compensate news organizations for the use of their material.</p><p>Some residents in community Facebook groups found workarounds by pasting news article links, with added spaces or text in the link to bypass the block, and adding instructions on how to restore them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP: The McDougall Creek wildfire burns Friday on the mountainside above lakefront homes in West Kelowna, Canada.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Jason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP: Evacuees from Yellowknife, territorial capital of the Northwest Territories, are greeted with the Aurora Borealis as they arrive to a free campsite provided by the community Friday in High Level, Alberta, Canada.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP: The McDougall Creek wildfire burns on the mountainside above houses in West Kelowna, British Columbia, on Friday.

Doug LaMalfa:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R Richvale) participated in a House Committee on Agriculture hearing titled, \"A 2022 Review of the Farm Bill: Energy Renewable Energy Opportunities in Rural America\". This hearing examined the 2018 Farm Bill energy programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA provides several grant and loan opportunities for agriculture-based renewable energy programs, including biofuels (ethanol) and biomass.</p><p>There are five major sources of renewable energy: solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass, and hydropower. As of 2020, these renewable energy sources provided approximately 12% of the total U.S. energy consumption, including 20% of the total U.S. electricity generation.</p><p>\"Energy independence is vital to our national security. America needs to embrace an energy policy that supports every type, from natural gas and oil drilling to nuclear and every reasonable renewable. We cannot simply declare that some methods of power generation are off limits. Energy production of all kinds has been important for rural economies; providing jobs, farm income, and tax revenue.</p><p>California is the leading state in biomass production, and it's very important for the North State. We have millions of tons of waste biomass sitting on our forest floors dry, decomposing, and waiting to be part of the next catastrophic forest fire. By converting forest waste to domestic energy, we help prevent debris buildup and keep our forests healthy, curtail wildfires, strengthen energy independence, and create thousands of local jobs at each step of the process. Biomass is a win-win-win for everyone,\" said Congressman LaMalfa.</p><p>Congressman Doug LaMalfa is a lifelong farmer representing California's First Congressional District, including Butte, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou and Tehama Counties.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125135484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:655F-Y4V1-DYTH-G3BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 5, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

High humidity levels helped tamp down the flames while crews made progress carving buffer lines to protect communities on the edge of the fire zone, Dennis Burns, a fire behavior analyst for the incident management team, told a morning briefing. <br/>Much of the effort was focused on the outskirts of Yreka, the Siskiyou County seat and former Gold Rush town now home to 7,800 residents. <br/>Burns said thunderstorms in the forecast may bring welcome rainfall to the area, or erratic winds that could fan the flames anew, as well as possible lightning strikes that might ignite further fires. <br/>The cause of the McKinney blaze was under investigation. <br/>The fire erupted amid record-breaking heat in a region where drought-desiccated trees and undergrowth had already created a highly combustible fuel bed, in keeping with extreme conditions scientists ascribe to human-induced climate change. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767165948753658025976100041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:662S-3FK1-F03R-N35F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484255</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"446\"/><timeReceived>12:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 3, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. </p><p>But a research geneticist for the Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood Wilke sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasps' nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case. He poached maple trees prized as wood for musical instruments and brought them to lumber mills. In July 2018, a man who had just been released from prison, Shawn Williams, joined the conspiracy; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than two years in prison. In August 2018, the group decided to cut the maple tree that had the wasps' nest near the base, prosecutors said. The poachers sprayed insecticide and gasoline and then lit the nest on fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201d starting a 5.2-square-mile wildfire that came to be dubbed the Maple Fire, according to authorities. Firefighting efforts cost about $4.2 million. Williams testified during the trial that it was Wilke who had set the blaze, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. \"When people steal trees from our public lands, they are stealing a beautiful and irreplaceable resource from all of us and from future generations,\" acting U.S. Attorney Tessa Gorman said in a news release. \"That theft, coupled with the sheer destruction of the forest fire that resulted from this activity, warrants federal criminal prosecution.\" Wilke faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in October. \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000017aa0efdff6a7faa7ef42810000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63B9-K031-DY7N-F3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating in Clayton, Australia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The spring and summer of 2019-2020 (Black Summer) saw the largest and most significant bushfire outbreak recorded in eastern Australia. In Victoria, the fires ran from mid-November through early autumn.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Monash University, \"In this paper, we use a high-spatial and temporal resolution 48-year fire weather re-analysis data set (VicClim5) to describe fire weather and vertical wind and stability profiles for five significant high Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) fire events and compare these with detailed fire reconstructions. A feature of several of these fires was very active overnight fire spread driven by topographically enhanced low-level jets and low fine fuel moisture content. The FFDI values on these nights were either the highest or near highest on record in the 48-year data set. We describe cases of lightning ignition, prefrontal fire spread and two cases of post-frontal fire spread - one into Mallacoota on the early morning of 31 December 2019 and the other a northward overnight run down the Buffalo Valley on 4-5 January 2020. On two of the days studied there were complex wind changes associated with the inland penetration of low-level south-easterly winds under the influence of locally generated pressure gradients. An elevated hot, dry mixed layer above these shallow layers also played an important role. On one occasion there is some evidence of possible mountain-wave modulation of surface wind flows.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These events demonstrate a range of features of the fire weather and climate in eastern Victoria and the utility of VicClim5 in 3-dimensional climatological analyses.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Meteorological Drivers of the Eastern Victorian Black Summer (2019-2020) Fires.
