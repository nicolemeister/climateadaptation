The region, with its quick-draining sandy soil, is in peak forest fire season. The trees are still developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>It's a vast wilderness in the country's most densely populated state.

Starting out in the documentary world in his 20s, he sharpened the signature observational aesthetic that came to define his cinema.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It took me quite some years to find my voice and a successful way to make a marriage [between] recording and recreating reality,\" Greengrass says about his approach to fictional stories with the instincts of a documentarian. \"I just realized, instead of trying to shoot films like a drama director would, it would be much better if I reached back to where my roots were.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That filmmaking philosophy resulted in several modern-day drawn-from-the-headlines classics, including titles like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Captain Phillips</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United 93,</emphasis> and even informed the breathtaking white-knuckle aesthetics of his <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/archive/6681713/how-the-bourne-boys-keep-it-real/\">Bourne franchise</url> films. Now, that truthful quality is all over <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lost Bus</emphasis>, as he reconstructs a miraculous tale of heroism and survival amid the raging 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5471782/california-wildfires-2/\">Camp Fire</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5455128/how-paradise-california-will-rebuild-after-wildfire/\">Paradise, Calif.</url> The movie tells the story of bus driver Kevin McKay (<url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5917208/matthew-mcconaughey-us-politics/\">Matthew McConaughey</url>) and school teacher Mary Ludwig (<url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/6964958/america-ferrera/\">America Ferrera</url>), who saved the lives of 22 children as the most catastrophic wildfire in California history rages around them.</p><p>\"The pieces that I've done in drawing on factual routes tend to operate around two poles,\" Greengrass tells TIME ahead of the film's premiere at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/7314526/the-smashing-machine-mark-kerr-true-story/\">2025 Toronto Film Festival</url>. \"One is what I would call quiet, austere pieces, like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bloody Sunday</emphasis>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://entertainment.time.com/2013/08/12/flights-of-fancy-10-great-airplane-movies/slide/united-93/\">United 93</url>, or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">22 July</emphasis>, films interested in the granular detail of reality. And then there are others like <url normalizedValue=\"https://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/12/movie-fact-check-captain-phillips/\">Captain Phillips</url>-based on true stories, but much more <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">movie</emphasis> experiences. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lost Bus</emphasis> is down that second road.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/7311660/most-anticipated-movies-fall-2025/\">The 46 Most Anticipated Movies of Fall 2025</url>\u00a0\u00a0</p><h>A heroic true story </h><p>On Nov. 8, 2018, a failure on the PG&amp;E transmission line caused the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, which started in Northern California's Butte County, and spread rapidly thanks to dangerous high-wind conditions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5468345/search-camp-fire-california/\">ultimately killing 85 people</url> and displacing more than 50,000. In her award-winning 2021 book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire</emphasis>, San Francisco <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chronicle</emphasis> writer Lizzie Johnson offered a comprehensive account of the fires through the eyes of multiple local stakeholders. The book-or rather, the section of the book that covers the miraculous story of the school bus that McKay drove to safety after responding to an emergency call-became the basis of Greengrass' movie co-written by <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5953833/mare-of-easttown-review/\">Mare of Easttown</url>creator Brad Ingelsby. It's a film Greengrass instantly knew he would make when the story was brought to him.</p><p>\"It's amazing how much time you spend agonizing about films that you <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">don't</emphasis> make or complete,\" Greengrass reflects. \"The films that you do make tend to go, 'Yeah, I'm going to do that.' I was always going to make the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bourne</emphasis> movies, as I loved the first one. When they told me about this bus and kids, I went, 'I know how to do that.' It was that instinctive.\"</p><p>One movie Greengrass immediately thought of as a reference point (other than his own films like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Captain Phillips</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United 93</emphasis>, also set in contained environments) was John Ford's 1939 Western <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stagecoach\u00ad.</emphasis> \"Any kind of compression in the story gives you cinematic possibilities,\" says Greengrass. \"And I'm interested in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">kinetic</emphasis> cinema, the cinema of motion. If you are in the middle of a dangerous situation, your camera moves with you.\"</p><p>The story grabbed him thematically too, given the increasing devastation caused by wildfires and other environmental catastrophes. \"I'm always interested in what's driving our world today. For example in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Captain Phillips</emphasis>, this tiny encounter on the high seas dramatized what globalization meant.\" Greengrass viewed the story of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lost Bus</emphasis> through a similar lens, following a micro, primal cinematic story of survival that was ultimately about what these disasters mean on a macro level. \"Lizzie's book is much broader, about the whole story of the fire. And the Kevin story is only a handful of pages in it. And it seemed very appropriate for a movie.\"</p><p>The urgency of the film only grew when the <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/7207852/los-angeles-wildfires-history/\">Los Angeles fires</url> came early in 2025, just as he was finishing the movie. \"Our editor Billy Goldenberg had to go home-he nearly lost his house. That was a humbling moment,\" remembers Greengrass. \"[We] realized that we've created these images that are a part of the world we live in. And that we are going to have to learn to deal with these life-threatening events.\"</p><h>Truth vs. fiction</h><p>How do you shape reality on cinematic terms to entertain an audience, without taking advantage of the real people who lived through the events you're depicting? Achieving this delicate balance was a priority for Greengrass and Ingelsby. \"You have to make choices to create an authentic dramatic piece that conveys truth,\"\u00a0 Greengrass says. \"Even the selection of this one story is a choice. But you make choices in a documentary too,\" he adds. \"The question is, does it <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">feel</emphasis> real with a pulse of truthfulness? Or does it feel exploitative or propagandized?\"</p><p>While the writing duo had to take certain dramatic liberties (including excluding a second teacher, Abbie Davis, who was on the bus but didn't want to be involved in the movie), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lost Bus</emphasis> achieves that pulse of truthfulness, thanks to Greengrass' commitment to authenticity and emotional resonance. To that end, Greengrass made sure both McConaughey and Ferrera spoke to the real heroes underpinning their characters to understand what they went through. \"Obviously we didn't contact any of the children because they were minors. But when you make a film, you create a family of stakeholders, and I take carrying those people to the end with care, respect, and consent very seriously.\"</p><p>Another liberty was taken when choosing a location. The team thought it would be insensitive to shoot in California, so they chose a New Mexico town as a stand-in. \"Paradise is a blue collar town, not an affluent Southern California spot-it's a different world. We shot three hours outside of Santa Fe, in a town called Ruidoso, which was uncannily similar.\"</p><h>Real fires, real safety</h><p>One major logistical benefit of Ruidoso was an abandoned arts college that the production secured in the area, a large campus with actual roads and bends that they could safely and completely control, without having to set foot on any public roads. Once his producing partner Greg Goodman found this spot, Greengrass quickly ditched the initial idea he had about shooting on stage, at the Sphere Las Vegas, realizing that it would rob the movie off that essential kinetic energy he was after.</p><p>The only safe way to get real fires was laying gas lines and creating gas burns, without releasing any particles in the air that would potentially cause a forest fire. So the team did exactly that, with real motion and safe fire plumes. Another challenge was lighting, to shoot everything in a visually coherent and realistic manner amid all the smoke. \"In forest fires, you get this strange, occluded light, almost like an eclipse because the smoke gets across the sun and then eventually becomes very dense and dark, even though it's 10 o'clock in the morning,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>The solution for obtaining that exact light was shooting the driving scenes during the similar glow of the magic hour daily in one-hour time slots. That demanded an extraordinary amount of planning and organization, with all gas burners laid out, all traffic pieces, choreography, and stunts rigorously rehearsed, and kids carefully prepared for the process. \"It would be a very, very intense experience for the actors. We would get three long takes basically, that's it. And that gave us the intensity of a theater stage-you can only play it once.\"</p><p>The film's terrifying final ride, when the bus is surrounded by fire on all sides with no choice but to drive through it, is when Greengrass thought of Ford's 1939 classic the most, transitioning the tone from a realistic realm to a more cinematic one. \"As they go down the hill, you are in that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stagecoach</emphasis> with them, going through the fire. And then you get to the end, and the parents come. I always find that very moving, [operating] in a more cinematic mode. And hopefully the whole thing mirrors a full movie experience.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, another master and masterwork became a reference point, when Ingelsby and Greengrass decided to treat the fires as a character, like an on-approach beast with a POV: <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/6234045/steven-spielberg-interview-the-fabelmans/\">Steven Spielberg's</url> timeless blockbuster, <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/3894762/jaws-1975-review/\">Jaws</url>. \"I remember saying to my long-time editor Goldenberg, 'This film needs the shark. We need to personify the fires like the shark in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jaws</emphasis>,'\" Greengrass says, calling Spielberg \"the last of the great classical motion picture makers.\" \"That's why I created those shots of the fire moving. So you felt its voracious appetite and then its insidious character at the end when they get trapped.\"\u00a0</p><h>A thoroughly committed cast\u00a0</h><p>Greengrass utilized his instincts of marrying truth with fiction in the casting process too, making sure the priority was bringing on \"feel-alikes\" instead of lookalikes. \"Let's talk momentarily about Matthew,\" Greengrass suggests. \"He's a movie star, obviously, but also a brilliant <url normalizedValue=\"https://entertainment.time.com/2013/11/08/the-true-story-of-dallas-buyers-club/\">character actor</url>. He comes from Texas, and had an absolute affinity with Paradise and Kevin's world. It is an interesting place with a lot of passions and a sense that the riches of California have not been divided out fairly to their community. Matthew really got that.\" Much of the set-up for McKay's character involves him trying to be a better father and a better son, and lovingly caring for his terminally ill dog across a heartbreakingly poignant scene. All those details were based in truth, and what made it feel even more real was casting McConaughey's real mother Kay McConaughey and son Levi McConaughey in those parts. \"Incidentally, when I cast his son, I didn't know that he was his son,\" Greengrass recalls with a laugh. \"And Kevin's son and Matthew's son became pals apparently.\"</p><p>The team had to approach the scary scenes involving kids carefully, and plan around some time restrictions for shooting with minors. Their golden-hour limited-time approach worked to their advantage, ensuring that the kids were never overworked and all guidelines were easily met. In terms of ensuring their emotional wellbeing throughout the tough scenes, \"I have to say Matthew and America were fantastic. They were like surrogate teachers for them,\" says Greengrass. \"They embraced that [responsibility] and made the movie work. And those kids from the Santa Fe school were proper actors. They were fantastically good.\"</p><h>A focus on human resilience </h><p>There is one moment in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lost Bus</emphasis> when a fire chief played by Yul Vazquez, while updating the press on the uncontrollable Camp Fire, notes that we would be fools to ignore the fact that these types of wildfires are getting worse. That is pretty much the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">only</emphasis> moment in the movie when a character makes an overt statement with an aptly environmentalist agenda. \"I just felt there had to be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">one</emphasis> moment, and it felt like an appropriate moment when you've lived through something like that,\" Greengrass says. \"There are [worsening] fires everywhere [around the world]. I think I made implicit things explicit.\"</p><p>But elsewhere, Greengrassavoided preachiness at all costs<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis>He prioritized emotional truthfulness instead, letting the larger context of widespread environmental issues emerge organically. \"I think most people don't come to this movie to have a lecture, and I don't believe that you get one,\" he says. \"Movies are there to entertain us, to transport us to worlds that we fear or can't imagine. To move us, to make us laugh, to make us cry... Those are the feelings that I want out of a movie.\"\u00a0</p><p>Greengrass uses the scene where the bus becomes stationary as an example of conveying feelings without being pedantic. \"Mary and Kevin are talking about their worries in a very realistic environment. And the themes [around] global warming, asking, 'Is it too late?,' come together without ever being a lecture. Those are the themes because they are what the characters are wrestling with.\"</p><p>Greengrass approached the portrayal of <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5501994/p-g-e-corp-bankruptcy/\">PG&amp;E corporation</url> and its <url normalizedValue=\"https://time.com/5717148/pge-ceo-california-wildfires/\">negligence</url> on similar terms. \"It's not really a film about PG&amp;E, but their failure to maintain the infrastructure was the prime course of the fire, and that's just the facts of it,\" he says. \"It's just part of what you need to know to understand why these fires do what they do.\"\"The thing that movies do best is [portray] the resilience of human beings in the face of adversity and peril,\" Greengrass reflects. \"When you go back to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Stagecoach</emphasis>, the old master showed us the way.

(AP) \u2014 A <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/video/new-jersey-forest-fire-prompts-evacuations-and-closes-a-major-highway-2aeda5247bb34ebcab7e4b45779017aa\">fast-moving wildfire</url> engulfing part of New Jersey's Pine Barrens has not resulted in any injuries, officials said Wednesday, though it's expected to grow before forecast rain later this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fire in southern New Jersey's Lacey and Ocean townships has grown to more than 20 square miles (52 square kilometers) and could continue to burn for days, officials said. No one has been injured so far in the blaze, and 5,000 residents were evacuated but have been permitted to return home. A single commercial building and some vehicles were destroyed in the fire, while 12 structures remained threatened Wednesday evening.</p><p>\u201cThis is still a very active fire,\u201d said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette. \u201cAs we continue to get this under full control the expectation is that the number of acres will grow and will grow in a place that is unpopulated.\u201d</p><p>Officials said the fire is believed to be the second-worst in the last two decades, smaller only than a 2007 blaze that burned 26 square miles (67 square kilometers).</p><p>The Garden State Parkway, one of New Jersey's busiest highways, reopened Wednesday morning after officials closed a roughly 7-mile (12-kilometer) stretch in the southern part of the state.</p><p>Acting Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency early Wednesday as officials said they've contained about 50% of the wildfire.</p><p>Video released by the state agency overseeing the fire service showed billowing white and black clouds of smoke, intense flames engulfing pines and firefighters dousing a charred structure.</p><p>The cause of the fire is still under investigation, authorities said.</p><p>Forest fires are a common occurrence in the Pine Barrens, a 1.1 million-acre (445,000-hectare) state and federally protected reserve about the size of the Grand Canyon lying halfway between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. The region, with its quick-draining sandy soil, is in peak forest fire season. The trees are still developing leaves, humidity remains low and winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.</p><p>It's a vast wilderness in the country's most densely populated state. LaTourette, the DEP commissioner, said the fire is straddling an area on the edge of wilderness and residential areas.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the interface where the environment and development meet,\u201d he said.</p><p>The area <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/drought-new-york-water-conservation-new-jersey-121d29c25df168fa5b9d3d74add27d7c\">had been under a severe drought</url> until recently, when early spring rains helped dampen the region, but officials cautioned recent low humidity and a dry stretch have heightened the risk of fire.</p><p>The Jersey Central Power and Light Company cut power to about 25,000 customers at the request of the Forest Fire Service and the wildfire\u2019s command post Tuesday evening. By late Wednesday afternoon, power had been restored.</p><p>On Tuesday, Debi Schaffer was caught in gridlocked traffic after evacuating with her two dogs while her husband agreed to stay with their 22 chickens, <url normalizedValue=\"https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/local/article_5d3ccdec-286f-470d-928e-b14582e7a71c.html\">The Press of Atlantic City reported</url>.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take them in the car with me; can you imagine 22 chickens in a car?\u201d she told the newspaper.</p><p>Around her Waretown house it was \u201clike a war zone,\u201d she said, describing smoke, sirens and the buzz of helicopters.</p><p>The site of the fire is near an alpaca farm. The farm said in a Facebook post that the property wasn\u2019t threatened and all of the animals were safe.</p><p>The blaze is the second major forest fire in the region in less than a week.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-54b9d32e868a12be0556f2631975e55220250423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMS-9JH3-RV4G-42MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304479</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><timeReceived>11:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

There is no significant rainfall expected in the next week, and more than 35% of the state is considered to be abnormally dry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There have been 508 wildfires in Maine this year as of Wednesday, burning about 393 acres, said Terri Teller, a forest fire prevention specialist with the Maine Forest Service. More than 100 of those have occurred in August.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Maine Forest Service rangers have responded to dozens of wildfires this week and on Wednesday issued a warning on social media about the very high fire danger. Local fire wardens have stopped issuing burn permits, a move that the forest service supports. The state's online permit system is shut down, and the forest service is not issuing any open burning permits.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/24672226/thumbnail\">Link to Image</url></p><p>\"In many parts of the state local authorities have implemented restrictions to open burning based on fire danger and their ability to respond to wildfires,\" the forest service wrote in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100069086504633\">Facebook post</url>.</p><p>The forest service said Wednesday that all of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/wildfire_danger_report/index.html\">southern, central and western Maine</url>, plus some areas north and east of Millinocket, are now considered to be in very high fire danger, which is the second-highest level. The rest of the state is classified as high fire danger.</p><p>Teller said Maine tends to reach the very high level a few times each year - especially during April and May, which is peak season for brush fires - but it's unusual for the risk to be so high in August.</p><p>When the fire danger is considered very high, fires can start easily from all causes, spread rapidly and intensify quickly. Spot fires are a constant danger, the forest service said. In areas with high fire dangers, unattended brush and campfires are likely to escape and spread quickly.</p><p>The forest service assigns daily fire danger ratings based on temperature, humidity, wind speed, recent precipitation and fuel moisture content.</p><p>Sarah Jamison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Gray, said the fire danger is a growing concern. Conditions across Maine started to get a little dry earlier this summer but rapidly declined coming into August because there has been little or no rainfall for much of the state, she said.</p><p>Most of Maine is now 3 to 5 inches of rainfall below normal, Jamison said, and lake and stream levels are dropping, exacerbated by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2025/08/11/high-temperatures-to-grip-much-of-maine-for-the-next-few-days-forecasters-say/\">recent stretches of hot weather</url>.</p><p>In the next week, some scattered showers may develop in parts of the state, but not the wetting rainfall - more than a quarter inch of widespread rain - that is needed to make a difference for fire conditions, she said.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the prognosis is not a very bright one,\" Jamison said.</p><h>CREWS BATTLE BLAZES</h><p>On Monday evening, the Biddeford Fire Department began receiving 911 calls reporting heavy smoke coming from the woods behind the Home Depot and Cumberland Farms on Alfred Street.</p><p>Firefighters found the fire nearly 3,000 feet into the woods behind the Home Depot and called in backup from the forest service and seven surrounding communities. They have stretched thousands of feet of hoses into the woods to get water onto the area, said Biddeford fire Chief Larry Best.</p><p>The next day, 17 firefighters from Biddeford, Saco, Kennebunk and the forest service continued their attack on the fire, which Best said likely started from a campfire. Crews have been using axes and other hand tools to get at underground spots where fire keeps popping up, he said.</p><p>\"It's so dry out there, and the fires are burning deep into the ground, which is a real challenge for us,\" Best said Wednesday. \"We get it out, and then we have to go back to continue digging it up and wetting it down.\"</p><p>By Wednesday, crews were using a forest service truck to dump 300 gallons of water at a time on the fire. Best said crews have been able to contain the fire to an area that's a little under 2 acres.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Acton, fire crews have spent two days fighting a brush fire on Sanborn Road. On Wednesday afternoon, fire crews there struck a fourth alarm to call in more assistance.</p><p>In Down East Maine, at least three wildfires have been reported in the past week, most notably <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2025/08/11/30-acre-wildfire-burning-along-canadian-border-down-east/\">a 30-acre blaze in Baileyville</url>, near the Canadian border. That fire was 20% contained as of Monday, officials said.</p><p>The forest service also responded to a half-acre wildfire on Big Island in Sakom Township that was 25% contained by Tuesday night. In Marion Township, a wildfire started by a power line was quickly contained Tuesday, the forest service said.</p><p>In response to the uptick in fires, the forest service is increasing staffing, deploying additional wildfire suppression equipment and increasing aviation coverage, which Teller says is valuable both for detecting fires quickly and for transporting crews to remote locations.</p><h>PREVENTING FIRES</h><p>Fire officials in Skowhegan recently said there has been an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/08/13/fires-at-sappis-skowhegan-paper-mill-blamed-on-dry-hot-weather/\">uptick in fires</url> at Sappi's Somerset Mill because of the dry, hot weather this summer. Deputy fire Chief Ryan Johnston said the department has responded to nine or 10 fires at the mill this year, including six or seven since June.</p><p>\"I attribute maybe 80% of it to the high heat and the lack of rain,\" Johnston said Tuesday. \"I think that that doesn't help matters.\"</p><p>The state Fire Marshal's Office says it has not yet seen a pattern of building fires related to dry conditions, but local fire officials say there are steps people can take to make sure they don't spark fires that could spread to buildings.</p><p>Best, the Biddeford fire chief, said people should not have campfires and need to be extra cautious to properly dispose of smoking materials.</p><p>\"Everything is dry,\" he said. \"If leaves accumulate around houses or in alleyways and someone discards smoking material, fires can get going very quickly around buildings.\"</p><p>To help prevent wildfires and property damage, officials recommend clearing a 30-foot space around buildings that is free of dead leaves, brush and other flammable materials.</p><p>People should also make sure grills, fire pits and chimneys are clear and function properly, and homeowners should consider fire-resistant landscaping.</p><p>\"If you're going to have a recreational campfire on your own land, make sure to keep it small, have plenty of water available and never leave it unattended,\" said Teller, of the forest service.</p><p>Members of the public are also advised to call 911 if they see an out-of-control fire or a concerning amount of smoke in wild areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Staff Writers Drew Johnson and Jake Freudberg contributed to this report.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNJOU-httpswwwsunjournalcom20250813wildfiresareburningacrossmaineasdryspellcontributestoincreasingdanger</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNJOU2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGT-9RG3-RTBN-P0BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">490508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Lewiston Sun Journal  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunjournal.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64499\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 13, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.3% is 0.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"512\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.8</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.3% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.3%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 177.4%.

The multiple meanings and associations evoked by the term are the stuff of poetry and drama. They are written into the continent\u2019s culture and traditions; they give shape to its year through their corralling of hopes and dreams, their promise of longer, lazier days to come. \u201cSumer is icumen in\u201d (Summer is a\u2019coming in\u2019), sang eager anticipators back in 13th century England, \u201cLhude sing cucu\u201d (Loudly sing cuckoo).</p><p><br/><br/>Alongside such benign perspectives, European culture has provided regular reminders of summer\u2019s fickleness, of its propensity to generate extreme events, whether bouts of blistering heat or violent storms that ruin crops and livelihoods. Balancing Shakespeare\u2019s use of summer as an extended metaphor for beauty in Sonnet 18 (\u201cShall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\u201d) is the portrayal of summer offered by the composer Vivaldi in his \u201cFour Seasons\u201d concerti: an energetic and not remotely lyrical evocation of intense Italian heat followed by thunderous storms.<br/><br/>Over an extended period, Europeans have learned to live with summer\u2019s contradictory qualities. In the continent\u2019s south, windows come with shutters that close out the heat. Siestas offer respite from the sun at its most intense while opening up extended evenings in the cooler air. In July and August, the hottest months, European schools close for six to eight weeks. Families head to the beach or seek fresh mountain air; festivals erupt everywhere: contemporary music at Glastonbury; jazz in Marciac; Mozart in Salzburg; and across Italy an array of boisterous local celebrations that summon everyone out onto the streets.<br/><br/>In recent years, however, this long-standing ability to coexist with\u2014and derive pleasure from\u2014summer in all its contrariness has been finding itself strained to the limit. Manifestations of extreme weather that were once regarded as flukes are now becoming the norm. As climate change powers ahead, unrestrained by any remotely adequate governmental intervention, Europe has now attained the dubious status of being the world\u2019s fastest warming continent.<br/><br/>Also Read | Europe, NATO, and Ukraine: Hurtling towards catastrophe<br/><br/>From mid-June to early July this year, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades. While June, a month traditionally associated with weddings, dawn-to-dusk birdsong and roses at their most glorious, was the hottest on record, this was just a foretaste of what was to follow. At the start of August, an immense dome of concentrated heat clamped itself down on Europe with limpet-like resolution, driving up temperatures to tropical levels, scorching fields and landscapes to a crisp, and generating tinderbox conditions primed for wildfires. In Spain, temperatures exceeding 45\u00b0C were recorded in six separate locations; thermometers in Western France touched just 2 or 3\u00b0C lower. Adding to the torment of these furnace conditions in some regions was the suffocating stench of burning vegetation as fires (some deliberately set; others \u00a0triggered by cigarette stubs or shards of discarded glass) began eating up vast tracts of combustible countryside: 3,82,000 hectares in Spain thus far this year, according to the European Forest Fire Information Service. In Britain, this August\u2019s unprecedented destruction wrought by wildfires in the North Yorkshire Moors national park has released centuries-worth of captured carbon into the atmosphere while laying waste, possibly for decades, sites of special scientific interest.<br/><br/>As to the human consequences of such manifestations of the speed and intensity of Europe\u2019s warming, data and analyses are available in spades. Take, for example, the European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA), first published last year by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in an attempt to spell out the urgency of the situation. The report identified no fewer than 36 major climate risks falling within five broad categories: ecosystems, food, health, infrastructure, and economy and finance. Eight risks were judged particularly urgent, all of them relevant to the conservation of ecosystems, the protection of people against extreme heat, floods and wildfires, and the continued viability of solidarity mechanisms to support people through the economic consequences of climate change: having assets destroyed by fire or flood, for example, and/or confronting impossibly high insurance premiums.<br/><br/>\u201cOur new analysis,\u201d wrote Leen Yia-Mononen, the EEA\u2019s Executive Director, in what comes across as a desperate and forlorn appeal, \u201cshows that Europe faces urgent climate risks that are growing faster than our societal preparedness. To ensure the resilience of our societies, European and national policymakers must act now to reduce climate risks both by rapid emission cuts and by strong adaptation policies and actions.\u201d<br/><br/>Therein lies the rub. Anticipating, or even daring to dream of, action on this scale from the current coterie of European movers and shakers\u2014whether political leaders, top bureaucrats, or knights of corporate capitalism\u2014is like nursing hopes of dancing on the moon. The priorities of the continent\u2019s key decision makers lie elsewhere.<br/><br/>In March 2025, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission and the continent\u2019s de facto empress, unfurled ReArm Europe, a gargantuan \u20ac800 billion military spending spree. Under its terms, governments across Europe are being urged to significantly raise defence spending as a percentage of GDP. In Germany, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has already scrapped long-standing fiscal restraints in order to begin the process of hiking up defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2029. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a fast-track swelling of the annual military budget to \u20ac64 billion ($74.8 billion) by 2027: a rise from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent of GDP. Not to be out done, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer now seems bent on pushing his austerity-battered country to the edge through his plan to gift the military an eye-watering 5 per cent of GDP by 2035.<br/><br/>The implications for Europe\u2019s climate of this immense funnelling of resources into already bloated military budgets are spelt out in a report published earlier this year by Greenly, a Paris-based private sector carbon accounting firm. Titled \u201cRearming Europe: Counting the Carbon Bootprint\u201d, the report is perplexingly difficult to access online. Fortunately, an article setting out its contents, written by Alexis Normand, Greenly\u2019s chief executive, is readily available on the website Sustainable Views.<br/><br/>Boiled down to its essentials, the Greenly report is an expos\u00e9 of a giant, irresolvable contradiction. On the one hand, European states and institutions make grandiose commitments to cut carbon emissions, and to some degree put in place systems to this end. At the same time, these same players make bellicose pledges to jack up military spending to levels not seen since the Cold War\u2014all the while drawing a veil over the climatic and environmental consequences.<br/><br/>Few of us are probably aware of the degree to which \u201cdefence\u201d spending is contributing to, and speeding up, the destruction of our planet. This is because, when it comes to eco-auditing, military budgets are off-limits and beyond scrutiny. In fact, militaries rank among the world\u2019s most carbon-intensive institutions. They run on fossil fuels. They consume enormous amounts of energy, often from the dirtiest of sources. As Normand highlights, materials integral to arms manufacture, such as aluminium, steel, titanium, and carbon composites \u201call have high embodied emissions, and modern weapons systems use lots of them.\u201d Global supply chains\u2014such as those for F-35 fighter planes, built across multiple continents\u2014add further emissions from logistics and transport.<br/><br/>\u201cGlobally, militaries and their supply chains are estimated to produce 5.5% of total greenhouse gas emissions\u2014more than all of Africa and more than the global aviation and shipping industries combined\u201d, notes the journalist Dominic Shales. \u201cAnd yet, military emissions are not capped, not taxed, and not subject to binding reduction targets.\u201d<br/><br/>This is where the implications of Europe\u2019s current militarisation drive really hit home. Last year, according to Greenly\u2019s estimates, NATO military spending reached $1.47 trillion, generating roughly 256 million tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent)\u2014more than the total emissions of Spain or Thailand. European UnionNATO members alone accounted for 79.5 million tonnes, a total projected to rise to 81.1 million tonnes this year.<br/><br/>Let us now factor in the ballooning military budgets that lie ahead. By Greenly\u2019s reckoning, the EU\u2019s \u20ac800 billion defence programme could generate more than 150 million tonnes of CO2e emissions. Add to this the military spending ambitions nursed by the European wing of the \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d. What this full-throttle rearmament amounts to, states Normand, is \u201cnot a one-time spike, but a structural transformation\u201d.<br/><br/>Also Read | The post-WWII system is dead.

Will we still hear the cuckoo\u2019s call, or the blackbird\u2019s throaty melodious song? Will butterflies still dance their way across meadows thick with wild flowers? Does pleasure lie ahead, or weeks of confinement in shuttered homes under constant threat of wildfires and emergency evacuation? Will anything remain of that eager anticipation, that sense of opening our arms to summer that is the stuff of our childhood memories?<br/><br/>Probably not, if the military fetishists and couch warriors currently ruling Europe have their way.<br/><br/>Susan Ram has spent much of her life viewing the world from different geographical locations.

Others near the bottom are Marseille and Avignon.</p><p>The top end, meanwhile, is filled with towns in Normandy and Brittany, and the Hauts-de-France.</p><p>To the delight of its town hall, in pole position is Foug\u00e8res, population 20,600.</p><p>Half an hour from Rennes and 40 minutes from Mont Saint-Michel, the town gained considerable wealth via the textile and crystal glass industry and was long France\u2019s shoemaking capital. But the only evidence of this is now in the town\u2019s museum.</p><p>With no train connection, and some way from the coast, Foug\u00e8res doesn\u2019t attract anything near the summer crowds you get in resorts like Saint-Malo, where some locals rail against over-tourism.</p><p>But gazing down at its pretty cobbled streets from atop Saint L\u00e9onard\u2019s church, it\u2019s easy to see why Foug\u00e8res (French for \u201cfern\u201d) has such impeccable climate credentials. Trees, greenery, and waterways are everywhere you look, with valleys and surrounding forests bringing fresh air and water to the town.</p><p>As well as its medieval walled fortress \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest \u2013 the town relied on its humid, marshy surroundings as a natural protection against the marauding English during the Hundred Years War. Now, Mother Nature is providing a different line of defence against the common enemy of global warming, according to Diana Lefeuvre, the town\u2019s deputy mayor in charge of green transition.</p><p>\u201cIts strengths lie in the fact that it is quite high up, it is protected by a beach forest that keeps it cool and provides drinking water, notably via drains built 200 years ago. It is hilly and has three waterways running through it. In fact, the city and castle were built around the river,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve also planted a lot of trees. There are 7,000, one for every three inhabitants, and these green lungs are one of our most important assets.\u201d</p><p>It is also well-positioned in terms of the Atlantic coast, far enough to avoid flood risks but near enough to gain from cooler, more temperate sea air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better to be fairly close to the coast but not right on it, especially if the coastline is low-lying and sandy,\u201d said Olivier Cantat, climatologist at the University of Caen Normandy.</p><p>\u201cTowns located further inland should fare better.\u201d Size is also important. Bigger cities trap the heat and risk becoming \u201curban heat islands\u201d, he added.</p><p>Situated about 25 miles inland, Foug\u00e8res may escape with fewer than five days of very high temperatures (at least 35C) and only about ten tropical nights (when temperatures fail to fall below 20C) by 2100.</p><p>By contrast, more than 100 nights a year could be tropical on the Mediterranean coast and in the Provence hinterland by 2100, twice as many as in recent decades. Average maximum temperatures in summer are likely to exceed 30C by the end of the century. On some days, the thermometer will climb to around 50C.</p><p>Lucy Arnold, 50, a British bilingual PA, said she had no regrets moving from Saffron Walden, Essex, to Foug\u00e8res seven years ago with her husband and two daughters.</p><p>They came to be closer to her parents, who have a house nearby, but also to enjoy the French life in a smallish, rural town away from urban \u201cpressure on our children in the UK from social media, that sort of thing\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAnd we felt that by doing so, we did gain a couple of years more childhood, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Climate-wise, the downside is \u201cwe get a lot of rain and certainly in the winter it can be quite wet and miserable\u201d, Ms Arnold said, but added that her family had shelved plans to buy a property further south due to fears of hotter weather.</p><p>She said that the climate fame of Foug\u00e8res was already causing a stir in the town. \u201cA friend contacted me yesterday and said: \u2018You must be very happy.\u2019 I said: \u2018Yes, but the thing is we might get flooded by British people now.\u2019 She said: \u2018Yes, but at least maybe our house prices will increase.\u2019\u201d</p><p>As for tourists, inside the fortress, Mireille and Guy David, two retired teachers who live in the French Pyrenees near the Spanish border, said they had driven up through France in their camper car and had stopped in Foug\u00e8res on their way to Ireland via ferry.</p><p>\u201cSummer is frankly becoming hellish in France. We prefer northern Europe,\u201d said Mrs David. \u201cDriving up, everything looked scorched and dry. We passed through the Landes in western France, which was hit by a massive forest fire a couple of years ago. Then suddenly, we reached Nantes and the greenery returned. It was such a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find this climate change personally really scary. Things are moving much faster than we were told. It feels like we\u2019re heading for a disaster scenario.\u201d</p><p>On a family holiday from Norfolk, Jack Brooks and his wife and daughter, Vicky and Rose, knew about Foug\u00e8res because his father bought a property in the area 20 years ago.</p><p>With an easy link from Saint-Malo or Cherbourg for Britons, the town boasts attractive brasseries and cafes beyond its centrepiece castle.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the weather today in Norfolk, it\u2019s roughly the same weather but the food\u2019s 10 times better,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider going down the South of France in summer because it would be too far to drive with children and be too hot for us. I\u2019m already getting a bit sweaty today. Frankly, this is my limit.\u201d</p><p>Matthieu David, a French-British PhD student at Caen Normandy University, has spent three summers studying tourist habits on northern French beaches on the nearby Norman Cotentin peninsula.</p><p>He found that just under half came for what he called \u201cthe strategic quest for coolness\u201d.</p><p>\u201cThese people have a probabilistic approach to heat waves. That is, they\u2019re not going to come because a heatwave is forecast but because there\u2019s a chance that they can avoid one at home when they come on holiday in the summer.\u201d</p><p>A quarter beat a tactical retreat as a knee-jerk reaction to a heatwave forecast, \u201cand decided to go somewhere cool\u201d.</p><p>He said that in both cases, \u201cthe idea of climate refugees is starting to emerge\u201d. \u201cWhen you dig deeper, you realise they don\u2019t have the same motivations as traditional tourists.\u201d</p><p>While officials in Foug\u00e8res were clearly pleased for the town to be singled out, Ms Lefeuvre warned the region couldn\u2019t handle a major influx.</p><p>\u201cWe can only welcome so many people because one mustn\u2019t forget that in Brittany we have limited water resources and are already suffering from drought,\u201d she said.</p><p>And even if it is better equipped to withstand global warming extremes in the short term, Vincent Dubreuil, vice-president of the Higher Breton Climate Council, said: \u201cBrittany isn\u2019t going to be spared from climate change. Foug\u00e8res will be 4C warmer at the end of the century, just like everywhere else.\u201d</p><p>According to his calculations, by then, nearby Rennes will have the same climate as Coimbra in central Portugal.</p><p>\u201cYou may say that\u2019s not a problem, except handling such spectacular changes in a short period of time is no easy feat.</p><p>\u201cThe key message is that climate change concerns all regions and there\u2019s as much adapting to be done to it in Brittany as anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>French experts said that similar towns in Britain would have topped the rankings too, given the UK\u2019s latitude and island status.</p><p>However, Ms Lefeuvre advised against complacency on either side of the Channel.</p><p>\u201cIn the latest projections, there are question marks over the sea currents that allow Brittany, but also Great Britain, to enjoy this favourable climate. If the current stops, we will have a continental climate and that would change everything,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lottery. When we talk about climate change, we still don\u2019t really know exactly what this change will actually bring.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-114051149</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GK5-X1R3-RRKS-53R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1487\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 25, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The other half of the country has witnessed an anguished succession of images, cries and appearances. The fire devoured more than 400,000 hectares, according to data from the European Commission's Forest Fire Information System.</p><p><br/>Pedro S\u00e1nchez made four of these speeches, all of them from the regions most affected by the worst wave of fires in the last twenty years: Galicia, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Extremadura and Asturias. The president proposed, in fact, to promote a great pact of State against the climatic emergency; \"necessary\", according to the brigadistas who have spoken to P\u00fablico, but practically impossible without the votes of the PP. \"There is no point in investing in black and abandoning green, it makes no sense,\" stressed the experts consulted by this newspaper.<br/>Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o does not seem to be for the work and has presented this Monday his alternative recipe, a package of 50 measures exposed during the press conference with which he inaugurated the electoral course. The popular tried to counteract with this announcement the media effect of the State Pact announced by S\u00e1nchez. The Galician leader, simultaneously with the catalog of ideas, tried to increase the pressure that the right wing intends to exert on the central government, despite the fact that the responsibility for the prevention and extinction of fires is entirely the responsibility of the autonomous regions. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this subject</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feij\u00f3o proposes a plan against fires with a register of arsonists as a star measure</emphasis><br/>Jose Carmona<br/><br/>Among the fifty or so measures, ten have generated more controversy than the rest. One of them consists of creating a national register of \"pyromaniacs\" and placing tracking bracelets on them; another aims to approve \"urgently\" a package of aid for personal injury or destruction of basic necessities and permanent housing. The first one, because of its difficult legal fit and the doubts about its usefulness in fire prevention, and the second one because it is already established by law. The Popular Party also intends to reinforce the structure of the UME, to increase the staff of SEPRONA and \"to create a National Forestry Fund, as a dynamic tool of the State forestry policy, essential for the conservation of the forest and the natural heritage\". <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The \"pyromaniacs\", a minority which tarnishes the debate</emphasis><br/>Vicente Rodr\u00edguez has clear words to define the PP plan: \"A toast to the sun\". The spokesman for the FIRET union and coordinator of the platform of associations and unions of firefighters and forest firefighters does not see a national strategy in these measures, but a smoke bomb: \"It is a ball thrown to cover up the incompetence of the different autonomous communities, which have not complied in prevention for years. In 2015 we were already in Europe putting the problem on the table,\" he asserts in statements to this media. The professional also maintains that \"the vast majority of measures proposed in the document are already implemented in the law\". Genoa, without going any further, proposes to give aid to the victims, something that is completed in the Civil Protection Law. \"It has no technical criteria behind it, it is to hide the embarrassments of the communities,\" he insists. Rodriguez is particularly critical of the measure against people who provoke fires and recognizes that they represent a small percentage of the total causes of fires.<br/>This is an idea shared by several of the sources consulted by P\u00fablico, who also ask not to generate confusion with the terminology. \"Pyromaniacs are sick people, often with disorders. The correct thing here would be to speak of arsonists and indeed there are not as many as is believed,\" says Federico Grillo, a member of the Official Association of Forestry Technical Engineers. \"Proposals on paper always look good, but it is important that they also have common sense. We can't think only about arsonists, the penalties are already harsh for them. The problem is that fire runs a lot and spreads for kilometers, taking houses and lives ahead. This should not happen and that is where the politicians should act, in prevention tasks\", adds the professor.<br/>Alba Nogueira, professor of Administrative Law at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), defines the Popular Party's catalog as a \"catch-all\" of \"improvised measures without substance\" and believes that it seeks to \"divert the focus and give the impression that everything that fails has to do with the state level\", when they are fundamentally issues that are provided for in the regional emergency plans, but failed, she points out, due to the \"lack of planning and personnel\". When the measures designed by the Popular Party were made public, Government sources also assured that at least four of the basic ideas of the plan were already included in different legislation such as the Forestry Law, the Spanish Forestry Strategy or two agreements feared and demonized by the right and the extreme right: the 2030 Agenda and the European Green Pact.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><br/>Opinion<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The PP, every day more incendiary</emphasis><br/>Juan Tortosa<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The balance, tipped to the wrong side</emphasis><br/>The PP has raised in more than half of the points a series of rebates and subsidies, direct or indirect, to alleviate the effects of this latest wave of fires. This is, in fact, the backbone of his plan. \"Of course we need aid, nobody is going to deny it or say no, but this cannot be the solution. [The popular] can not bet on post-fire checks when they have decades of neglect in the rural world, increasingly precarious,\" denounces a firefighter of the Brigade of Reinforcement in Forest Fires (BRIF) of Laza (Ourense), who prefers not to make public his identity. \"The climate crisis is evident and will continue to grow. The fires cannot be covered up with aid, because they will recur over time. It is necessary to propose measures for the future and we do not see them in this document,\" warns the same brigadista.<br/>This is a reading that is also shared by the Official Association of Forestry Engineers. \"The logical thing would be to propose agreements on prevention, in order to avoid oversized operations and save resources when it is time to focus on extinction and reconstruction,\" says Federico Grillo. The balance, for the member of this organization, is tilted in favor of the latter two issues, when it should be the other way around. \"The ideal would be not to have to go this far, that is, to invest and work on prevention, because the problem lies in the state of the forests. This is much clearer in the health field, if you invest in prevention, you mitigate the effects of the disease, so here it is the same,\" he adds in a conversation with this newspaper. Of the 50 measures that Feij\u00f3o presented this Monday, only one fifth have to do explicitly with tasks related to prevention and care of the land.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The wave of fires fuels in the fachosphere the hoaxes that nourish the denialist narrative of climate emergency</emphasis><br/>Juan Oliver<br/><br/>The allusions to the troops of the UME and SEPRONA are also striking, at least for the professionals and experts who have spoken to this media. Genova asks in its document to \"reinforce the structure\" of the first of the bodies, which depends on the Ministry of Defense, and \"urgently increase the staff\" of the second one. \"The UME is a reinforcement unit, it does not know the forest districts as the personnel of the brigades know them. It is absurd to reinforce a reinforcement and ignore the conditions of the autonomous operatives who do know what the terrain is like,\" Alba Nogueira explains. The professor puts on the table, in addition, the claims -almost historical- of the professionals of the sector. \"The PP talks about dignifying their conditions without saying that the communities, governed in this case by her party, should raise salaries and give them job continuity during the 12 months of the year,\" she points out. In his speech on Monday, Feij\u00f3o kept silent about prevention, knowing that it is a task that corresponds to the communities that governs mostly his formation.<br/>\"The UME and SEPRONA do not carry out tasks aimed at preventing the emergency, but to protect the population during the fires and collaborate in the post-emergency. What we need are more firefighters and forestry agents to directly attack the fire and work on prevention\", insist from the BRIF of Laza. The PP has also presented another measure, ambiguous and that has generated discomfort within the union FIRET, as is the number 44. \"Ensure sufficient means for the reinforcement in firefighting through an adequate budget allocation,\" reads the letter. Vicente Rodr\u00edguez recalls that this is already in the hands of the autonomous communities. \"In no autonomous community of the PP are putting real measures or application of the current law to improve the lives of workers. It is in their hands and they do not do it. It is like prevention, the Law of Forestry requires the communities to take preventive measures and they don't do it,\" he concludes.  <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72390866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKD-DGK3-RS8V-R18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 25, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Pol\u00edtica</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

According to news originating from Samcheok, South Korea, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"More than half of South Korea's land area is covered by forests, which significantly increases the potential for extensive damage in the event of a forest fire. The majority of forest fires in South Korea are caused by humans.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Ministry of Interior And Safety. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Kangwon National University: \"Over the past decade, more than half of these types of fires occurred during the spring season. Although human activities are the primary cause of forest fires, the fact that they are concentrated in the spring underscores the strong association between forest fires and meteorological factors. When meteorological conditions favor the occurrence of forest fires, certain triggering factors can lead to their ignition more easily. The purpose of this study is to analyze the meteorological factors influencing forest fires and to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for forest fire occurrence, focusing on meteorological data. The study focuses on four regions within Gangwon province in South Korea, which have experienced substantial damage from forest fires. To construct the model, historical meteorological data were collected, surrogate variables were calculated, and a variable selection process was applied to identify relevant meteorological factors. Five machine learning models were then used to predict forest fire occurrence and ensemble techniques were employed to enhance the model's performance. The performance of the developed forest fire prediction model was evaluated using evaluation metrics.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results indicate that the ensemble model outperformed the individual models, with a higher F1-score and a notable reduction in false positives compared to the individual models. This suggests that the model developed in this study, when combined with meteorological forecast data, can potentially predict forest fire occurrence and provide insights into the expected severity of fires. This information could support decision-making for forest fire management, aiding in the development of more effective fire response plans.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: A Forest Fire Prediction Model Based on Meteorological Factors and the Multi-Model Ensemble Method.

According to news originating from Fairbanks, Alaska, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"As wildland fires in Alaska and its boreal forest become more extreme, preparing for the upcoming wildfire season has become increasingly challenging for fire managers. This study was developed in close collaboration with fire managers to address their need for advanced summer fire outlooks issued in March and May.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA, National Science Foundation (NSF), State of Alaska, National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, \"Three seasonal forecast models are used to create summer fire outlooks: NOAA CFSv2, ECMWF SEAS5, and Me &lt;acute accent &gt;te &lt;acute accent &gt;oFrance System8. Variables from these forecasts are used to calculate Buildup Index (BUI), an operationally used fire weather index from the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System. The BUI outlooks are evaluated based on Alaska wildfire subseason, BUI tercile, and predictive service area subregion with the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), Heidke, and mean squared error (MSE) skill scores. Skill is greatest for the wind (April 1-June 10) and drought (July 21-August 9) subseasons and in the Western Boreal subregion of Alaska. Combining the models into a multimodel ensemble increases forecast skill by an average of 11% (19%) for the March (May) forecast AUROC score and an average of 87% (92%) for the March (May) forecast Heidke skill score. May forecasts typically have equal or greater skill than March forecasts, with the greatest increases in skill seen during the wind subseason. However, instances of higher Heidke and MSE skill scores for March forecasts, especially in later subseasons and during large fires years, could be explained by the seasonally decreased predictability. Alaska's wildfire season has changed over the past 30 years. The season has lengthened by about a month, and extreme fire events have become more frequent. Fire managers begin preparing for the upcoming fire season in March, several weeks before the administrative start of the fire season (April 1) and about three months before the typical peak in late June to early July. With the increasing availability of dynamical seasonal forecasts, the Alaska fire management community has expressed growing interest in using these tools for operational planning. In this study, we used March-initialized seasonal forecasts to generate early-season outlooks of the Buildup Index (BUI), a key fire weather variable. These outlooks align with the timing of critical early-season decision-making by fire managers, including resource allocation and national coordination. After several years of providing these outlooks, fire managers requested additional outlooks initialized in May to support decisions after the season has begun but before its peak. Although May-initialized forecasts are typically more skillful, our early focus on the more challenging March forecasts reflects our commitment to meeting fire managers' needs. This long-term collaboration, including presentations at spring meetings and sustained engagement through biweekly calls, has helped refine our scientific focus-e.g., by emphasizing the duff-burning subseason and the timing of seasonending rains. Throughout this work, we have taken an operational perspective, aiming to keep methods computationally efficient to accommodate the large data volumes and time-sensitive decision-making. As such, the current study establishes a baseline of forecast skill using relatively streamlined methods. This foundation allows the fire management community to explore ways to tailor and enhance forecast products, such as applying more advanced bias correction techniques for high-latitude models or refining skill assessments by subregion or subseason. It also creates a platform for optimizing the multimodel ensemble approach, either by adjusting model weights or expanding the ensemble membership. This work represents one component of a broader effort to improve seasonal fire weather prediction in Alaska. As collaboration continues, these BUI outlooks can be integrated with emerging long-range forecasting products for fuels and lightning to build a more comprehensive picture of the upcoming fire season.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We remain actively engaged with fire managers, sharing updates during spring and fall operational meetings and incorporating their feedback in ongoing research and tool development.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: On Using Dynamical Seasonal Forecasts To Develop Management-driven Wildland Fire Outlooks In Alaska.

Rainfall was about half of average at 0.27 of an inch.</p><p>This July, by contrast, was the wettest at the airport since 2015, with a total of 1.16 inches.</p><p>The average high this July was 85.9 degrees, the coolest since 2016 and only slightly above the long-term average of 85.6.</p><p>The combination of average temperatures and above average rainfall has kept fire danger indices below average for most of the fire season.</p><p>One index, the energy release component, which projects how fast a fire would spread, is below average in each of the eight zones in Northeastern Oregon as of Aug. 4. That\u2019s been the case since about July 20.</p><p>The fire danger is significantly lower now than it was a year ago, Kingsbury said.</p><p>He said the spate of small fires has been a godsend for ODF firefighters, many of whom are newcomers.</p><p>They have had lots of fires to work on, but without the nearly constant crises that prevailed for much of last summer.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Although Crouch and Kingsbury are pleased with how the fire season has progressed, both emphasized that early August historically is within the peak period for wildfire potential.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what the next six weeks looks like,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cBut every day that passes is one less day of fire season.\u201d</p><p>Crouch points out that in the grass and sagebrush country that makes up most of the BLM\u2019s Vale District, the fuels dry rapidly even after a torrential downpour. Just a couple days of hot, dry and windy weather \u2014 typical for August \u2014 can erase the beneficial effects of rain.</p><p>At higher elevations, where forests dominate, the benefits persist longer, Crouch said.</p><p>Kingsbury said the frequent rain over the past month have kept wildfire fuel damper than usual, a major factor in fires that are more likely to smolder than to spread.</p><p>Although lightning has ignited most blazes over the past couple weeks, Crouch reminds residents that they can help mightily by complying with fire regulations \u2014 all burning is prohibited on the Vale District, and there are restrictions on some national forest land in the region.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re busy chasing lightning fires the last thing we need is a human-caused fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Malheur National Forest, as of Wednesday, Aug. 6, will ease public use restrictions on the south side of the forest. Currently, campfires are allowed only in designated recreation sites in that part of the forest.</p><p>Fire restrictions are available at bmidc.org/restrictions.shtml</p><p>Fire dispatch logs are posted at:</p><p>\u2022 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wildwebe.net/incidents?dc_Name=ORVAC\">www.wildwebe.net/incidents?dc_Name=ORVAC</url></p><p>\u2022 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wildwebe.net/incidents?dc_Name=ORBMC\">www.wildwebe.net/incidents?dc_Name=ORBMC</url></p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Baker City Herald (Baker City, Ore.).

According to news reporting from Chengdu, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In recent years, the continuous development of deep learning has significantly advanced its application in the field of remote sensing. However, the semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images remains challenging due to the presence of multi-scale objects and intricate spatial details, often leading to the loss of critical information during segmentation.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Sichuan Science And Technology Program \u201cresearch on Precise Identification of Forest Fire Risks For Distribution Lines of 35 Kv And Below Crossing Forest Areas\u201d. <br/> Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China: \"To address this issue and enable fast and accurate segmentation of remote sensing images, we made improvements based on SegNet and named the enhanced model CSNet. CSNet is built upon the SegNet architecture and incorporates a coordinate attention (CA) mechanism, which enables the network to focus on salient features and capture global spatial information, thereby improving segmentation accuracy and facilitating the recovery of spatial structures. Furthermore, skip connections are introduced between the encoder and decoder to directly transfer low-level features to the decoder. This promotes the fusion of semantic information at different levels, enhances the recovery of fine-grained details, and optimizes the gradient flow during training, effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and improving training efficiency. Additionally, a hybrid loss function combining weighted cross-entropy and Dice loss is employed. To address the issue of class imbalance, several categories within the dataset are merged, and samples with an excessively high proportion of background pixels are removed.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These strategies significantly enhance the segmentation performance, particularly for small-sample classes. Experimental results from the Five-Billion-Pixels dataset demonstrate that, while introducing only a modest increase in parameters compared to SegNet, CSNet achieves superior segmentation performance in terms of overall classification accuracy, boundary delineation, and detail preservation, outperforming established methods such as U-Net, FCN, DeepLabv3+, SegNet, ViT, HRNe and BiFormert.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: CSNet: A Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation Network Based on Coordinate Attention and Skip Connections.

According to news reporting from Harbin, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"The frequent occurrence of forest fires has caused a great threat to the ecological environment and the safety of human life and property. How to effectively prevent and control forest fires has become a top priority.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Key R &amp; D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by Heilongjiang Province, Key Research and Development Projects in Heilongjiang Province, Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Foundation, Undergraduate Innovation Project for Northeast Forestry University. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Northeast Forestry University, \"However, water-based fire extinguishing agents commonly used in forest fires possessed the problems of poor spraying effectiveness, adhesion and spreading, and fire extinguishing efficiency. Inspired by the porous thermal insulation materials, a novel silica hydrogel-based fire extinguishing agent (SiKP) was successfully prepared by micro-crosslinking silica aerogel and introducing phosphorus and potassium fire extinguishing elements. SiKP showed excellent high-temperature adhesion properties on wood surfaces and their pH meets the requirements of its application. After spraying SiKP, the open flame of the wood stacks was extinguished quickly within 2 s and the smoldering time of wood stacks was 29.71% less than that of pure water. The phosphorus- and potassiumcontaining free radicals and inert gases from the decomposition of SiKP effectively interrupted the free radical chain reaction and diluted the combustible gas concentration in gas phase. Besides, SiKP promoted the dehydration and charring of forest vegetation and the formation of a compact barrier char layer effectively prevents the transfer of heat and flammable volatiles in condensed phase. Consequently, the total heat and total smoke release of NW/Si3K3P6 were decreased by 51.05% and 72.86% compared with pure pine.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This novel forest fire extinguishing agent with excellent adhesion, fire extinguishing, and sustained fire resistance properties shows great value for the prevention and control of forest fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Novel Silica Hydrogel-based Forest Fire Extinguishing Agent: Construction, Fire Extinguishing Performance and Mechanism Study.

The Government of Alfonso Rueda, however, speaks of 95,000, that is, about 45,000 hectares less than those counted by European satellites. \"It is not a debatable difference. The gap is huge, we are talking about hiding almost a third of the Copernicus estimate. The Xunta has the real data, but prefers to make up the reality to make it seem that the environmental and property damage is less,\" says Francisco Lueiro, spokesman for the environmental group Arco Iris.</p><p><br/>It is true that the statistics published by the European satellite, practically in real time, are provisional and take into account all the burnt surface that the cameras capture from tens of kilometers away. What the communities usually do afterwards is to discount all those areas that have survived the flames, known as islands, as well as roads, pastures and agricultural or urban land. \"The Xunta, at the same time, usually increases its own figure until the two are close. We are not so much talking about a technical issue, as a communication strategy,\" say various brigadistas consulted by P\u00fablico, who prefer not to make their identities public. The Conseller\u00eda de Medio Rural confirms to this media that the data they have revealed this week may undergo variations because, \"while the outbreaks are not controlled or extinguished\", \"the exact areas\" that the fire has devastated \"cannot be known\".<br/>The regional administration also recalls that in its calculations \"the hectares of agricultural nature are not counted\" and tries to minimize the controversy generated by the obvious gap that exists for now between the two data. \"Within the perimeter of the fires there are still unburned areas. The difference with Copernicus may respond to this issue (...) The satellite does not distinguish well and we prefer to play it safe,\" the ministry responds. The Xunta not only rejects the accusations of lack of transparency, but also emphasizes: \"Every year, with the update of the Pladiga [plan for prevention and defense against forest fires], the technical information (...) of all forest fires of the previous year is recorded with total clarity\". The problem is that the aforementioned plan is usually presented in the spring of the following year, that is, almost ten months after the high-risk period, when practically no one comes anymore to collate information on the number of hectares razed by the fires of the previous season. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><br/>Opinion<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Spanish government's new policy to reduce the number of fires in Spain</emphasis><br/>Ana Pardo de Vera<br/>Copernicus has also published its estimates for the rest of the communities affected by the fires of the last four weeks. The European satellite puts the number of hectares burned this August in Castilla y Le\u00f3n at 150,000. Extremadura, for its part, would have been damaged an area of 45,000 hectares. P\u00fablico has contacted both administrations. The first has not responded to the questions of this medium, but even two members of different regional brigades have been able to confirm that no daily data of burned hectares are given and that, once the fire season is over, \"make the measurement and usually lower what comes from the satellite\", again excluding non-forest land and \"areas that have not burned completely, in which there has been a little green, however little. The objective, according to these professionals, would be \"to make believe that less forests and areas have burned than have actually burned, to appear less serious\".<br/>The Government of Maria Guardiola does offer quantitative results as it progresses in extinguishing the outbreaks, both in the INFOEX portal and in the channels of 112 Extremadura. The General Directorate of Fires explains to P\u00fablico how its operation works: \"We have a coordination helicopter that performs orthophotographs and allows us to know the area affected by each fire almost in real time\". The popular, here yes, put in value both their own system and the work of the EFFIS satellites. \"We usually compare it and the two measurements are similar, very reliable and very even\", insist from the department.<br/>Asturias, where 2,405 hectares have burned according to Copernicus, made a first estimate from EFFIS calculations, \"based on satellite images and spectral analysis, which guarantees the reliability of the data\", as sources from the Department of Mobility, Environment and Forest Management confirm to this newspaper. The Principality's environmental agents will now review the satellite's provisional reports to make the appropriate adjustments before transferring the final sum to the Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge. This portfolio has not been able to explain to P\u00fablico before the publication of this article how it makes the total computation of the statistics of all the communities and if it plans to establish from now on a unified criterion to measure the burned areas in the whole of the State. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The use of last century's means to quantify ashes</emphasis><br/>This is, in fact, another of the great dilemmas for political representatives and professionals in the sector. Galicia, for example, uses aerial photographs and manual tools to measure the extent of what has been devastated by the flames. This is how the Conseller\u00eda de Medio Rural itself explains it to P\u00fablico: \"The measurement systems, while the outbreaks have not been extinguished, take as a basis the information offered by aerial means [photographs from helicopters or airplanes that are then digitized] and also the personnel operating from the ground (...) Once the fires are under control, GPS is used to determine the affected areas\". The Xunta, in fact, insists: \"These systems have a wide international accreditation in the sector\". Forestry experts, however, consider that satellite measurement is much faster, more accurate and effective, especially in the face of fires as large and virulent as those of this summer.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this topic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The wave of fires fuels in the fachosphere the hoaxes that feed the climate emergency denialist narrative</emphasis><br/>Juan Oliver<br/><br/>\"The manual perimetry can help you to classify a small fire, but not one of 15,000 or 20,000 hectares. In these cases, satellites are the finest tool. GPS or aerial photos can lead to errors, mainly human. Satellite is pure mathematics: you have five hectares, subtract two [not burned] and you have three left. It's like a chessboard, there's no trick to it,\" compares Carlos Madrigal, territorial dean of the Madrid Community of the Official Association of Forestry Technical Engineers. Galicia also has \"180 fixed surveillance cameras\" deployed in its forests. It is not, however, the only community that uses \"conventional\" formulas despite the technological advances made in the last ten years. Castilla-La Mancha and Asturias, in fact, are two of the few that use satellites to carry out these tasks. \"The difference is evident,\" says the engineer.<br/>What all the autonomous regions do do is to cover before the end of the year a standardized fire report through the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge. This also has its nuances. The environmental agents of each community collect in this form the definitive data of burned areas and incorporate other technical aspects such as the type of vegetation or the volume of wood burned. The report is the same for all the territories, but each one, however, measures the number of hectares affected in its own way. \"The calculation would have to be done in the same way in all the communities, especially with regard to large forest fires. It is true that the competences are autonomous, but many things should be unified at a national level and one of them is, without a doubt, the measurement of surfaces\", Madrigal continues.  <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this issue</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Galicia, the community that burns the most while the Xunta renounces to protect 88% of the territory with Red Natura</emphasis><br/>Juan Oliver<br/>  Image of the burned area in Larouco (Ourense) by the worst fire in the history of Galicia<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.Brais Lorenzo / EFE</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Galicia only informs of burns of more than 20 hectares</emphasis><br/>The way in which each community reports fires is also the subject of a separate chapter. Galicia is here again one of the most controversial, given, however, that it is the only one that has an official and specific account to make communications that have to do with forest emergencies: @incendios085. Castilla y Le\u00f3n, for its part, has the INFORCYL platform, which reports the progress of the fires \"in real time\", without including, as had been warned, the number of hectares burned. The Government of Ma\u00f1ueco also sends during the high-risk period two daily press reports, one at 10.00 and another at 19.00. \"And all the fires that are known, as long as they are over one hectare, are entered in the database we work with, from where the press report comes out,\" explains Agust\u00edn Argulo, fire technician in the regional operation and national environmental delegate of CSIF. Extremadura uses INFOEX accounts. And Barb\u00f3n uses the networks of 112 Asturias and issues daily press releases \"depending on the evolution of the fires\", but reporting on all of them, \"from a small one to one of hundreds of hectares\". <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related to this issue</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The workers of the Galician public television ask for the dismissal of those in charge of news for the coverage of the fires</emphasis><br/>What is then the controversy with Galicia? The PP came to the Government of the Xunta in 2009. Feij\u00f3o ousted the bipartite and took control of the Galician Parliament. The PP launched that same year an \"internal instruction\" to notify only through public channels the fires of more than 20 hectares, as warned by legal and sectoral sources consulted by P\u00fablico and confirmed by the Department of Rural Environment. The administration also warns of those outbreaks that affect natural parks and those that are in operational situation 2. \"The criterion of proactively reporting fires of more than 20 hectares was established in 2009, based on technical criteria and responsibility,\" they argue from Medio Rural. The reason would be, they say, to avoid a possible call effect. \"Reporting each and every one of the records that occur could generate social alarm and have an undesirable effect of encouraging incendiary action,\" they specify from the Conseller\u00eda.<br/>The Xunta maintains, however, that it offers \"detailed and timely information on any outbreak for which media professionals are consulted, regardless of its surface area\". The measure was taken three years after another of the great waves of fires that threatened Galicia, the emergency of 2006.

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser 's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. In 2024, Weyerhaeuser reported net sales of $7.1 billion and employed around 9,400 people globally.</p><p>The Gorman Group, a family-owned business founded in 1951, operates multiple divisions in Southern British Columbia and northern Washington state, employing about 900 individuals. The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 12, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.</p><p>Key attributes of the acquisition:</p><p>Located in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>Price/Earnings of 67.4 &gt; Building Materials &amp; Fixtures sector (of 24 stocks) avg of 29.6:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 67.4 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 29.6 and market average of 13.0.</p><p>6.1 Rank in the bottom 21% by Relative Valuation in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"280\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">P/E * P/NTA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">128.12</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 21%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings Yield %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/Earnings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">67.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 4%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.2 Rank in the bottom 16% by Price Performance in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PV1000 [1 yr] $</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">781</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 16%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rel Strength 6 mo</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>6.3 Downtrend</p><p>Today's Volatility:</p><p>The 5% premium to 12-month low of $23.71 against the 23% discount to high of $32.59 suggests the stock continues to push for new lows. </p><p>Today its volatility (highest price minus lowest price/lowest price) of 2.0% was 0.9 times the average daily volatility of 2.3%, up from 1.3% on Wednesday.

He opens a jar filled with a dark brown liquid and dips a piece of polystyrene in it. Then, with a blowtorch, he starts to set it on fire. The liquid repels the fire and creates a crust that protects the plastic, preventing its destruction. People applaud. He doesn't stop there and does the same with a sheet of kitchen paper, and even risks his own hand, knowing that nothing will happen. For the final flourish, he drinks a shot of the product and simulates a live brush fire. Again,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> the wet vegetable holds up while the rest burns.</emphasis> With everyone impressed by the ingenuity, he closes the performance with a devastating message: the administrations know about his creation, but almost no one has bought it in the worst year of fires in the history of Spain.</p><p><br/> Sallent is the inventor of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ecofire</emphasis>, a product of Aragonese origin that has been resonating for two years in the media and social networks. Every time there is a wave of fires, this liquid appears. A secret formula with a national signature that, according to its creators, overnight would make it possible to extinguish fires better and faster, in addition to protecting firefighters and the population. However, the final message remains the same: very few are buying it.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> What is really happening with this invention?</emphasis> The creators blame the situation on the lack of interest in the protection of the Administration, but El Confidencial has consulted several experts in the sector who give other answers.<br/> \"The first thing that strikes anyone who knows a little about this is to see such a product advertised on television. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We are talking about flame retardants</emphasis>, technical developments that, as such, reach the market in a different way. You don't need to convince the general public to buy it, but technicians, experts, administrations and laboratories,\" explains <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guillermo Rein</emphasis>, professor of fire science in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London, who specializes in heat transfer, combustion and fire, using a combination of laboratory experiments and computer modeling. \"Past that point, we can go into making a more technical analysis, which is what remains when the cameras are turned off and in this case leaves some doubts,\" adds the expert.<br/> Since its launch, in 2022, Sallent has made demonstrations for all kinds of audiences, has recorded spectacular tests with the UME or companies such as the Madrid <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EMT</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iberdrola</emphasis>. He has shown it in the media as a revolutionary product and as a unique liquid, 100% biodegradable, ecological and organic. But when it comes down to it, among the large public entities that have acquired it, only the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Provincial Council of Huesca</emphasis> appears, with equipment that has been delivered to isolated areas far from fire stations. Distributed globally under the umbrella of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SimonRack</emphasis>, a company from Zaragoza dedicated to the manufacture of metal shelving, it can also be purchased in large supermarkets or hardware stores and they have a collaboration for a fire protection system for parking lots.<br/> Its position in the generalist market has been gaining ground, but its creator does not get off his main objective: forest fires. He continues to insist, also in conversation with this newspaper, that the general problem lies with the administrations, which, for some unknown reason,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> have not wanted to negotiate with him</emphasis> and acquire an invention that could be key. But the experts' answers differ from this version. The technical characteristics of Ecofire and the lack of testing in real cases hinder this development. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The invention</emphasis><br/> To analyze Sallent's ingenuity, one could start with the formula, but its inventor refuses to give the ingredients, because he assures that it is like<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Coca-Cola</emphasis>\". As for the safety data sheets that, according to the law, all chemicals on the market must have, he assures that he doesn't even need them because \"neither water, sugar nor orange juice have to have them\". Therefore, in order to be able to compare his solution with others on the market, it is necessary to go further.<br/>Ecofire is sold as a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> fire \"blocker,\"</emphasis> but that term does not exist at the technical level, nor is its inclusion under discussion. As indicated in its efficacy report, issued by INIA-CIFOR (a CSIC institute), it is a long-term retardant. This is the name given to a type of chemical that serves, in the case of forest fires, as an extra tool to help extinguish the fire, slowing the spread of the fire and better controlling its progress. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INIA results</emphasis> show that Sallent's solution is effective in this task, scoring top marks, and other certificates also show that it is non-toxic and non-hazardous to people and plants. But its problems are different.<br/> \"We are talking about a market in which it competes with products that have similar efficiency in the laboratory, but which, above all, and this is key, can be diluted in water. You have to provide this material to firefighting systems that have aircraft that need thousands and thousands of liters of liquid in each action,\" say industry sources who prefer to remain anonymous. \"To use Ecofire<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it is recommended not to mix it</emphasis>, which makes it impossible to take it into account for these cases\".<br/> According to these experts, dilution makes it possible to size and be operational. \"It is usually requested that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">these products can be diluted at the rate of 1/4 or 1/6 in water</emphasis> and Ecofire does not allow any dilution,\" they say. \"For example, in each summer you can easily distribute about 1,000 tons of regular retardant, multiply that by six and you get the total amount of solution you would need to store if we were to use that product. There are no warehouses with such a capacity, and no way to transport the solution to the operation.\"<br/> \"According to the experiences that have come to me, technically it works, it prevents combustion. The problem is at what price. Not only monetary, which is very expensive compared to other retardants, but cleaning the equipment used with this product is quite cumbersome. This is a serious problem in forest fires,\" says<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Ignacio Villaverde</emphasis>, a forest firefighter and publicist. \"A water pump is a very complex system and to avoid failures and breakdowns, which are very expensive, the system must be perfectly clean. And it takes half an hour or more to clean a pump properly, and be prepared to throw away 4,000L of water in the process,\" he adds.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vicente Mans, an </emphasis>engineer who was part of the first Spanish team to study the use of retardants in forest fires, more than three decades ago, and who has been working in this sector ever since, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">confirms these needs</emphasis>. He does not directly mention the case of Ecofire, but clarifies the situation. \"Today there are three types of retardants, those that change the pyrolysis of cellulose, those that work by evaporating water and cooling the environment and those that generate a film that protects materials from the impact of fire. The first are the most famous and in countries like France or the USA, which set the pace in this world, they don't even consider using others,\" he says.<br/> \"Here we are trying to develop standards that include them, because we must not stop innovation and we must provide regulations that allow everyone to compete and normalize their situation,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> but they do not yet exist</emphasis>,\" says Mans. \"Dilution falls within the key points because you cannot transport thousands of liters in the middle of emergencies and in natural areas, it is not operational,\" he adds.<br/>Ecofire would fall into the third group, those that create a film called intumescent that protects the material it coats from the action of fire for a certain time. It is something that has been seen for many years in paints and that in the case of the Aragonese invention goes one step further because it is a liquid. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The lack of standardization</emphasis> of these inventions is already a handicap with which the solution is burdened and with which those who bet on acquiring it must deal, but it can be compared with the others if we talk in terms of effectiveness or toxicity.<br/> Normally, those who change the pyrolysis of cellulose use chemicals that can be pollutants, the famous phosphates that mix with water, dye the discharges of airplanes so as not to confuse and leave a striking trace. That polluting part would give advantage to new proposals such as the one coming from Huesca, but in recent decades has already been generating an industry of ecological solutions to change this with the same type of solution. The CSIC itself, together with the company Primalchic and the Polytechnic University of Valencia, developed in 2020 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">an ecological product</emphasis> that contains \"innocuous or very low toxicity compounds, which are also biodegradable and have a high extinguishing capacity\", detailed its presentation.<br/> Unlike Sallent's invention, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the CSIC does provide a good part of its ingredients</emphasis>. In addition, it can be compared with Ecofire by the laboratory results and see that the INIA gives an almost identical result to both inventions. In some points it gives better results to the first one and in others to the other, but without great differences according to what can be consulted.<br/> \"Another problem with these intumescent products is that in order for them to be effective against all types of forest fires, the product must be spread perfectly on the vegetation so that it covers it completely. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If you throw it on low grass, it may work</emphasis>. But if you throw it on an abandoned chestnut grove full of brambles, ferns, broom, heather, hawthorns, grasses and a thousand species that make up the undergrowth, it will be difficult to cover everything. You could try with aerial discharges, many of them. But we return to the fact that it would be very expensive that way,\" Villaverde points out. \"That's why many of us don't consider it suitable for use in large-scale forest fire prevention or suppression.\" <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The inventor</emphasis><br/> C\u00e9sar Sallent, who comes from a family of inventors and who, before getting into this field, designed robots for the police and even solutions for the Melilla fence, defends his product. In conversation with this newspaper he assures that he has created a unique solution and that it should be bought as a key tool to protect citizens from forest fires.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> He denies conversations with other laboratories</emphasis> to approach the authorities, as well as assures that he has only received some comments from investment funds for the purchase of the formula. \"It is not something to make money, but to sit down with the administration and create agreements that will save many people and put an end to the fires\".<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION: I have tried to look everywhere for the formula of your product, but I can't find it anywhere. However, I have seen that other retardant companies do detail part of the compound, why don't you do it?</emphasis><br/> ANSWER. You are not going to find the formula, it is not even in the patents I have published, which many people have already asked me about. I have it protected because it is not right that someone with my name can get on the Internet, see what it is made of and copy it. I can tell you that it has no polyphosphates and that it has a good percentage of water because otherwise it would be a paste, but nothing else. It's like Coca-Cola. It's organic stuff, edible stuff too.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. I have seen that INIA marks Ecofire as a long-term retardant, but you say it is a flame retardant. The term flame retardant does not exist in regulations.</emphasis><br/> A. Ecofire is not a retardant, it is a blocker, what happens is that INIA has done the most demanding tests it has, that is all. What we have done here is a very strong commitment to have a product that is organic, that is ecological, that all the components it contains are for human consumption. And what we have achieved is that where we apply it, it can withstand temperatures of 2,300 degrees, which are the maximum that I have managed to achieve with acetylene oxygen torches on a pine branch. The layer that expands when it comes into contact with fire is also refractory. That is very important. It has no thermal conductivity, sticks back to the materials and also avoids contact with oxygen. We have found that the solution can also work with class B fires and even with lithium batteries.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. They say it is 40 to 100 times more effective in firefighting than water, but I haven't found the certificate or study that proves that. Where do you get it from?</emphasis><br/> A. There is no certification, it comes from professional firefighters. That is what we have been told by firefighters who have used the product in real situations, in fires. They have called us and told us that they put out fires much faster and better. They tell me that while you need at least 50 liters of water for a firebreak, one liter of Ecofire is enough for them. It dissolves with water, and there have already been many smart people who have thrown that in my face, but it has to be that way to coexist with nature. In any case, 10 or 15 liters of water per square meter have to fall for it to disappear, which is an outrageous amount.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. Well, one of the weak points of the product, according to the experts, is that the water cannot be mixed, which complicates its use in large fires.</emphasis><br/> A. If you put 3000 liters of product in a truck and there are 100 liters of water, you are not going to notice the difference. Now, if you leave 1,000 liters, the effectiveness will drop quite a bit. But the important thing here is that we are talking about a product that can save the lives of lots of firefighters, lots of people, and this is something that I have already shown when I have appeared on television and in videos. And I have also shown it to Isaac Claver, president of the Provincial Council of Huesca, who has seen how it works and I have already given him several pieces of equipment so that he can deliver them to the towns of Huesca, so that they are protected. He has been concerned about the citizens, which is what politicians have to do, because it is shameful what is happening in this country.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. Why do you think that more administrations do not buy it?</emphasis><br/> A. It does not fit in my head. We have no competition, we have the firefighters of a lot of countries in love, big companies in Spain and other countries have already bought from us. I want people to have the product, which right now in Leroy Merlin a spray is worth about 16 euros, but if we sit down and negotiate millions of liters, it can be obtained in another way and at another price.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. Have you tried to present technical reports, go to tenders and so on to try to get them to buy it? Have you contacted laboratories to collaborate?</emphasis><br/> A. Everybody knows my product, I have appeared in the media, I was given more than 14 minutes on El Hormiguero.... I have made presentations everywhere, they know how to find me and that I can manufacture everything they need. They just have to be interested. As for the other laboratories, if my invention is already there, they don't have to spend their money on this, let them spend it on other things. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A new business niche</emphasis><br/> Sallent<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> hopes that the authorities will start knocking on his door soon</emphasis>. However, other members of the industry, such as Justo Ad\u00e1mez, engineer and CEO of Ashes Fire, a consulting firm specializing in the sector, offer him another way out. According to Ad\u00e1mez, who has been working on firefighting systems for decades, Ecofire can be groundbreaking when it comes to battery fire protection. A new risk that is increasingly present due to the growth of devices such as electric cars.<br/> \"It has been shown that water is not the best to extinguish this type of fire and that new alternatives must be sought due to the characteristics of these fires. For this reason, retardants that create a film that covers batteries and insulates the fire <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">are beginning to have a prominent position</emphasis> in the market,\" says the expert. \"Right now I only know of two that are giving very interesting results, Ecofire and an American invention called <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fike Blue</emphasis>. Both cases have demonstrated efficacy by flooding, i.e. you have to completely cover what is burning with this product to allow firefighters to act more safely and prevent the fire from spreading,\" he adds.<br/> As Mans also points out, doubts in this regard are based on the fact that <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">there is still no legislation on the matter</emphasis> and it is a niche to exploit. Hence, there is a lack of tests and certifications. \"That is the big problem, that there is no standardization and it is still a world to be explored. For example, I have seen that Ecofire uses ceiling diffusers to spread its product, that cannot be so because the diffusers are only allowed with water, it is the only substance that can pass through them by regulation because they are complex systems that must be treated with great care, \"he details.<br/> To conclude, Guillermo Rein leaves a last message beyond the technique. \"It is very dangerous to give the idea that something like forest fires, so complex and delicate, can be solved with a liquid. It leads people to trust and think that the necessary effort is not being made to fight them,\" he says. \"From tests to actual operations is a big step, and in environments such as forest fires, even more so. That's why technicians have to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">be skeptical before buying any</emphasis> miracle <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">product</emphasis> that appears on the TV.\"<br/> In the middle of prime time television, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C\u00e9sar Sallent</emphasis> shows his invention and puts it to the test. He opens a jar filled with a dark brown liquid and dips a piece of polystyrene in it. Then, with a blowtorch, he starts to set it on fire. The liquid repels the fire and creates a crust that protects the plastic, preventing its destruction. People applaud. He doesn't stop there and does the same with a sheet of kitchen paper, and even risks his own hand, knowing that nothing will happen. For the final flourish, he drinks a shot of the product and simulates a live brush fire. Again,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> the wet vegetable holds up while the rest burns.</emphasis> With everyone impressed by theingenuity, closes the performance with a devastating message: the administrations are aware of its creation, but almost no one has acquired it in the worst fire year in the history of Spain. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-73166566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GS3-RCC3-RS40-Y3V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>September 16, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002IG7</classCode><className>IBERDROLA SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS221121 ELECTRIC BULK POWER TRANSMISSION &amp;

It's just a bridge in the middle of nowhere,\" Ball said.  </p><p>\"You get a can of beer at the end and a handshake, and I guess for Ryan and I, that aligns quite nicely with how we go about life.\"  </p><p>The race is considered only 40% kayaking - the rest was navigation and other survival skills.  </p><p>They would have to map their way down 1600km of river, which freezes over each year, so when it melts again, the same paths may have moved.  </p><p>There would be plenty of other hazards too.  </p><p>Part of their compulsory gear list is masks and goggles due to the potential threat of forest fires.  </p><p>Meanwhile, hypothermia was a real risk thanks to the glacier-fed waters they would be wading.  </p><p>And then there's the wildlife.  </p><p>\"Bears are very active, so we have to take bear spray,\" Ball said.  </p><p>While some might think them mad for taking on such a risky adventure, the pair said that's what they're all about.  </p><p>Ball firmly believed there was an importance in \"feeling small\".  </p><p>\"In our urban, suburban lives, we forget how small we are. So when you're in a landscape like that it helps bring things into perspective.\"  </p><p>They had a few goals in mind but the first was not to die, Baxter joked.  </p><p>\"Second is to finish the race - we've got 10 days to do it.  </p><p>\"Whatever our placing is, we'll be happy as long as we've done the best we can.\"  </p><p>In true Kiwi form, their team name is \"Get a Dog Up Ya\", a homage to their Northland roots and can-do attitude.  </p><p>Those who want to support the duo have been asked to donate to a Givealittle page they have launched.  </p><p>The money will go towards sending a Northland teen who wouldn't otherwise have the means, to the outdoor adventure programme Outward Bound.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHAD-NRA,NAG,NAO,NAD,NAFNanbsyukon1000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHAD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G71-48J3-SJ8D-K14J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 NZME Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Northern Advocate (New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 9, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A7NI</classCode><className>FIRST AID</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST000DKM5</classCode><className>CANOEING &amp; KAYAKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000C42O</classCode><className>COLD INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp; RAFTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000C9Z9</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSLF</classCode><className>ADVENTURE TOURISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX356</classCode><className>WHITEHORSE, YT, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS117</classCode><className>ALASKA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS178</classCode><className>YUKON TERRITORY, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

According to news reporting from Concepcion, Chile, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wildfires in central-south Chile, consistent with trends observed in other Mediterranean regions, are expected to become more frequent and severe, threatening ecosystems and impacting millions of people. This study aims to enhance wildfire resilience in the central-south regions of Chile through the provision of robust information on current wildfire management practices and comparison with successful alternatives implemented in other fire-prone Mediterranean regions.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Anid. <br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion: \"With this aim, we consulted 55 local stakeholders involved in wildfire management, and alongside a comparative analysis of wildfire statistics and resource allocation in selected Mediterranean regions, we critically assessed different strategies to improve wildfire prevention and management in central-south Chile. The comparative analysis indicated notable economic under-investment for wildfire prevention in Chile. Compared to other Mediterranean countries, Chile is clearly below in terms of investment in forest fire prevention, both in global (public investment) and specific terms ($ ha<sup>-1</sup>, GDP per capita). The experts consulted included fuel management, governance and community participation, territorial management, landscape planning, socioeconomic evaluation, and education and awareness as key aspects for wildfire prevention. The results of the questionnaire indicated that there was a broad consensus regarding the importance of managing biomass to reduce fuel loads and vegetation continuity, thereby enhancing landscape resilience. Landscape planning and territorial management were also emphasized as critical tools to balance ecological needs with those of local communities, mitigating wildfire risks. Fire-Smart management emerged as a nature-based solution and a promising integrated approach, combining fuel treatments with modeling, simulation, and scenario evaluation based on local and regional environmental data. Additionally, educational and social engagement tools were considered vital for addressing misconceptions and fostering community support.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Besides a better integration of rural planning with social demands, this study underscores the urgent need to substantially increase the investment and significance of wildfire prevention measures in central-south Chile, which are key to improving its wildfire resilience. Our work contextualizes the reality of wildfires in central-south Chile and directly contributes to mitigating this growing concern by critically examining successful wildfire resilience strategies from comparable fire-prone regions, complementing ongoing local efforts and offering a practical guide for stakeholders in wildfire management and prevention, with particular relevance to central-south Chile and other regions with similar characteristics.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Improving Wildfire Resilience in the Mediterranean Central-South Regions of Chile.

Considering the destructive effects of forest fires, the preparation of forest fire probability maps can be a very valuable step towards reducing such effects.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from King Saud University. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Al Al-Bayt University, \"This study proposes two novel wrapper feature selection-based ensemble models that combine the strengths of Support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial neural networks (ANN) with bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for forest fire susceptibility mapping in the Jerash and Ajloun provinces of Jordan. By integrating multiple learning algorithms through ensemble methods, we aim to increase predictive accuracy and enhance the robustness of our findings. GA was employed for feature selection utilizing data from 207 forest fire locations and fourteen predictor variables. 70% of the forest fire locations (145 locations) were used in the training phase, and the remaining 60% (62 locations) were employed to validate the models. The accuracy of the models was measured by using the area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC). The AUROC for single SVM, single ANN, GBSVM, and GBANN models was 69.3%, 66.9%, 70.9%, and 70.4% in the validation phase, respectively. The results showed that wrapper and bagging-based ensemble models did much better than single models.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This shows that combining techniques can improve modeling performance for mapping the risk of forest fires.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Enhanced Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping By Integrating Feature Selection Genetic Algorithm and Bagging-based Support Vector Machine With Artificial Neural Networks.

That land mass is the equivalent to the entire state of Rhode Island.</p><p>The four Alaska panelists all mentioned the wildfires in the Interior this summer.</p><p>\"It's very real to us who are living here and smelling the smoke and seeing the fires summer after summer,\" La Belle-Hamer said.</p><p>She discussed her background with satellite imagery and how fire burn maps can inform what future fires would look like. </p><p>\"There's a huge potential that's not being realized at the University of Alaska Fairbanks,\" La Belle-Hamer said. </p><p>By combining the satellite imagery and fire department training at UAF with the science of what has happened in the boreal forest, \"we're actually so much better together,\" La Belle-Hamer said.</p><p>Edward Alexander, who is co-chair of the Gwich'in Council International, said that if a predicted wind event had actually materialized, \"Fairbanks could have easily been evacuated to Anchorage or to Whitehorse.\"</p><p>As of Aug. 1, there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://blm-egis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a23a625f4d18412ea13cffeefcbe7f5e\">187 active fires</url> in Alaska, 10 of which are staffed.</p><p>Morten H\u00f8glund, former Arctic ambassador for Norway, is a co-leader of the Arctic Wildland Fires Initiative along with Alexander. The initiative was <url normalizedValue=\"https://arctic-council.org/news/norwegian-chairship-arctic-wildland-fires-initiative/\">launched in 2023</url> by the Norwegian Chairship of the Arctic Council.</p><p>\"We just came to this issue after 65% of our (Gwich'in) homeland   burned during my lifetime,\" Alexander said Wednesday. \"It's basically equivalent to four states of Delaware on the upper corner of Alaska there, that have burned.\"</p><p>\"Our area has been slightly warmer than the rest of the Circumpolar Arctic by a couple of degrees,\" Alexander said about the Yukon FlatsNational Wildlife Refuge.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adn.com/resizer/I1heu4lWJQFHN8iEDZwhnszSXCs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/LX7DC3ZKZBEARFAGIBSU3DHXZI.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Not all parts of the globe are warming at the same rate. Alexander noted that the Arctic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3\">has warmed four times</url> more than the global average.</p><p>Seeing the effects of widespread smoke and fires in the Yukon, Alexander said that he and H\u00f8glund were concerned about what would happen once the rest of the circumpolar boreal forest reached higher temperatures.</p><p>Wildfires in the Arctic have different results compared to wildfires in the Lower 48. Alexander used Alaska and California as an example. In California, wildfires burn down to the soil. Comparatively, in Alaska, the fires burn to the duff   <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frames.gov/afsc/ACWE\">a surface layer</url> that insulates permafrost.</p><p>Permafrost is defined as soil or sediment that remains below 32 degrees Fahrenheit for two or more years. Permafrost contains large amounts of organic carbon, and as it thaws, the carbon that is trapped within the soil is released as a greenhouse gas.</p><p>The boreal forest, according to Alexander, serves as a protective blanket insulating the permafrost under it. When this blanket burns, the permafrost becomes vulnerable to thawing. Once this blanket is removed, there is no way to prevent or reverse the permafrost from thawing.</p><p>Areas in the Arctic contain permafrost whose carbon, when released, \"could be more than   a small country's entire emissions,\" according to Alexander.</p><p>Last summer, 1.6 million acres of \"permafrost-rich lands\" in the Yukon FlatsNational Wildlife Refuge were moved to a higher fire protection classification. Instead of letting areas burn in the early season, firefighters will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fws.gov/project/yukon-flats-fire-management\">manage the fires more closely</url> under the new classification.</p><p>The Yukon Flats spans 8.6 million acres in total.</p><p>Alexander pointed out that this area is \"affecting our future.\" He said that recent fires have burned so intensely on the Yukon Flats that the \"yedoma is collapsing.\" Yedoma is permafrost that formed in the Pleistocene period, which started roughly 2.6 million years ago.</p><p>According to the Woodwell Climate Research Center, where Alexander is a senior Arctic leader, <url normalizedValue=\"https://permafrost.woodwellclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PermafrostPathways-WoodwellClimateResearchCenter-ArcticBorealFire-QuickFacts.pdf\">20% of the permafrost</url> that is vulnerable to thawing is found in Alaska.</p><p>Boots on the ground</p><p>Alexander and fellow panelist Peter Butteri, a retired Alaska statewide fire planner, both worked as wildland firefighters. By partnering with scientists, Butteri said, firefighters are able to increase their effectiveness. Scientists at UAF like La Belle-Hamer look at various maps of the boreal forest, fire burns, scars and fuel maps to better predict fire activity.</p><p>\"We've got long-term researchers ... providing tools that we use on a daily basis,\" said Butteri.</p><p>Alexander sees an opportunity to use a new type of fire management in the state.</p><p>\"As firefighters, we tend to think of things as a chain saw problem or a Pulaski problem,\" Alexander said. \"You can't solve the circumpolar wildland fire crisis with a chain saw or a Pulaski (ax).\"</p><p>Instead, Alexander pointed to how the Gwich'in traditionally kept large wildfires at bay. The Gwich'in practice involves burning off the \"dead sticks and matter on the top\" in the spring, while the ground is still frozen, Alexander said. These mild fires, as Alexander put it, allow for more biodiversity to return, compared to severe fires that lead to widespread damage.</p><p>\"Mama moose has got protein shakes everywhere she goes,\" Alexander said about the plants that come back after mild fires.</p><p>Similarly to mowing a lawn every two weeks, Alexander said that cultural burnings every two years can be used as preventive maintenance.</p><p>\"If all the world's permafrost thawed, I mean, there's no amount of solar panels, or, you know, zero-emission cars or anything like that, that's going to create food security for humans,\" Alexander said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ANCHDN-https:/www.adn.com/alaskanews/science/2025/08/01/expertsemphasizeneedforinterioralaskawildfiremitigation/</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ANCHDN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GDR-BBB3-RSBW-T0PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><timeReceived>1:44 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Alaska Dispatch Publishing, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Anchorage Daily News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 2, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQ7E</classCode><className>EARTH OBSERVATION SATELLITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 12 of 12, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c.

Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.32% is 0.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.14%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.32</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.14</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.82</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.3% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.3%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 178.5%.

That translates to about 156 square miles (404 square kilometers), or about half the size of New York City, which has a land area of 300 square miles (778 square kilometers).</p><p>Not all researchers agree that megafire is a scientifically sound term, though Clements has used it, and with its usage by the media increasing, he believes it\u2019s \u201chere to stay,\u201d similar to \u201cheat dome\u201d and other popular weather labels that aren\u2019t formal scientific terms. References to 100,000 acres as megafires can also be found in some government reports and research in recent years.</p><h>Are megafires happening more often?</h><p>There were at least 14 wildfires that burned more than 100,000 acres in the U.S. in 2024, according to a report by the National Interagency Coordination Center.

Inter-annual variability in fire count and Fire Radiative Power (FRP), spatial spread of fires in the most active seasons during 2012\u20122023 on Indian landmass are reported. Fire data is extracted from 375\u00a0m active fire detection product of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) hosted by Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership. In every fire-year (March\u2013February), constructed from the month of remarkable escalation in fires, fires were most populated in March or April in summer and November in winter. The yearly sum of fire spots ranged from 492,282 (2013) to 731,154 (2021). Inter-annual fire count trend grew at a rate of 10,794 per year, excluding COVID years of 2020 and 2021. Many cities with &gt; 0.1 million population are located within or adjacent to the fire hot spots (20\u00a0km \u00d7 20\u00a0km grids), implying possibility of some impacts of seasonal fires both within and outside Wildfire Urban Interphases (WUIs). The study highlights the urgency of streamlining interventions to minimize wildfire incidences in order to protect forests, habitats, biodiversity, ecosystem services, human lives and property and minimize carbon loss, air pollution, perturbations in regional meteorology and radiative forcing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Forest fire, grassland fire, crop-residue burning (CRB) are prevalent worldwide since long1, 2\u20133. Fires in Savannah, forests, shifting cultivation, wood fuel combustion and CRB contributed about 50, 24, 10, 11, and 5%, respectively, in biomass fires occurred in tropic during late 1970\u2019s itself4. Cunningham et al.5 reports that frequency of extreme events increased by about 2.2-fold during 2003\u20132023, in which the last 7 years included the 6 most extreme ones. In spite of the fact that the total burnt area on earth may be declining, their study reports that fire behaviour is on a worsening trend in several regions, particularly the boreal and temperate conifer biomes, with serious implications on carbon storage and human exposure to wildfire disasters. In the recent 2023\u20132024 fire season, an area of 3.9 \u00d7 106 sq. km. was under fire and fire carbon (C) emission was to the tune of 2.4 Pg C. Noteworthy wildfire episodes were recorded in Canada, Greece, Western Amazonia, Hawaii and Chile6. UNEP7 has expressed concerns on escalating forest and peatland fires that are threatening the extensive ecosystem services received from these regions. Increasing trend in the proportion of areas under high-intensity fires is reported from boreal forests of Siberia, including the Arctic zone during the past decade8. Further, Australia is frequently devastated by wildfires, with the most recent episodes occurring during 2019\u20132020, costing in excess $4.4 billion in losses9.The evidences on the integral link of human health to wildfires is continuously emerging and has been reviewed recently10.Approximately 730 Tg biomass was estimated to have combusted annually in Asia during early parts of the decade of 2000 in which India\u2019s CRB had a share of about 18%11. In recent times, CRB alone accounted for about 25% of total biomass burnt worldwide12,13. The short interval of about 2\u20123 weeks in between rice harvesting and sowing of wheat have instigated farmers to burn paddy residues during Oct\u2013Nov in India to clear fields for sowing14. Indian Agricultural Research Institute reports combustion of about 14 million tons (Mt) (about 63.6%) out of about 22 Mt paddy stubble generated in India each year15. But, in spite of a longer interval of about 46\u201348 days in between wheat harvesting and sowing of rice during April\u2013May16, wheat stubbles are also found being put on fire in recent times17. Two important agricultural states of India, Haryana and Punjab, contributed about 48% to CRB during the first decade of twenty-first century18. Apart from CRB, severe incidences of fire are also reported from dry deciduous forests in India while other types of forests were found to be comparatively less prone to heavy fires19. More than 36% of India\u2019s forest cover is prone to frequent forest fires while about 4% and 6% of forest cover are extremely and highly fire prone, respectively20. On the other hand, forest fires are regularly spotted on Indian landmass, mostly during summer. According to Forest Survey of India (FSI), 52,785 forest fires were detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) while Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> (</emphasis>VIIRS) was able to detect 345,989 forest fires during November 2020 to June 202121. The escalation in forest and biomass fires in specific parts of India has been flagged earlier but fire data had largely been extracted from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) or MODIS22, 23, 24\u201325 that did not have comparable ability to acquire data on small fires like the Suomi-VIIRS has26.</p><p>Documented incidences of human influence in causing deliberate and sometimes inadvertent wildfires are concerning27. In mountain regions of North\u2013eastern India, slash and burn agriculture is practiced for long to clear forest land for agriculture, leading to arson in forest patches28. Banerjee29 found that wind speed, temperature, closeness to roads and tree cover are the crucial limiting factors in wildfires incidences in Sikkim Himalaya of India. Other factors like altitude, forests composition, precipitation and population density of trees also influence wildfires30. Fire Radiative Power (FRP), a measure of instant radiative energy emanating from fires31, is depicted as pixel-integrated FRP in Mega Watts (MW). It is an important variable to characterize the extent of fire32.</p><p>Biomass fires, remotely detected by sensors mounted on satellites, is an extremely useful method to study wildfires3,33,34. The data on thermal hotspots and fire activity reported by VIIRS and MODIS are known to conform in hotspot detection but a better spatial resolution of 375 m in VIIRS ensures better response for small fires35. The active fire data (375 m) reported by VIIRS that embarked on its mission on the polar orbiting Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) in 2012, complement the 1 km MODIS data acquired from Terra and Aqua satellites.</p><p>Wildfires and CRB lead to emissions of PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC) and several gases35, 36\u201337 Episodic biomass burning are also linked to substantial regional air pollution38. Further, biomass fires are known to alter landscapes39, cause hydrologic and geomorphic changes40, perturb local and regional meteorology41, change surface albedo in post-fire periods42,reduce organic soil carbon and nitrogen43, destruct forest biomass41,44 and flora and fauna45, enforce long-term climate change46, making biomass and wildfires extremely hostile to environment. Wildfires have strong influence on forest succession and play an active role in the replacement of existing tree species by new ones with different adaptation behaviour47. Microbial succession in soil in the aftermath of forest fires is also widely known48,49. Wildfires are also damaging to the delivery of ecosystem services like timber supply, animal hunting, honey, mushroom, resin and other forest product supply by inflicting losses in forest canopy, forest products, habitat and biodiversity50, 51\u201352. Fires also limit human access to forests, affecting livelihoods. Forests repeatedly destroyed by fires reportedly had lesser woody surface fuels and tree seedling densities as compared to forests experiencing only a sole and recent wildfire. Also, repeatedly burnt areas may recover differently than once-burnt areas, leading to alternative ecosystem structure53. It is therefore crucial to monitor historical and also, near real time (NRT) fire incidences on regular basis to counter recurrent fires and protect environment and natural resources.</p><p>This study was envisaged to analyze and report trends in fire counts and FRPs during 2012\u20132023, right from the beginning of data acquisition by Suomi-VIIRS up to 2023, considering the presence of a highly \u2018fire sensitive\u2019 I-Band with 375 m spatial resolution (at nadir) that can detect \u2018small\u2019 active fires with &lt; 1 MW FRP in VIIRS\u2019s34. This study gives insight on (i) temporal variability and trends of biomass fire spots on Indian landmass(ii) seasonality in the fire incidents (iii) fires hot spots in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids vis a vis the populated urban centres. The spatial spread and clustering of biomass fires in \u2018hot spots\u2019 over Indian landmass vis a vis seasons and populated cities, will help understand potential impacts of emanating smoke and heat on urban centres.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>Indian landmass (in between 8\u00b0 4\u2032 and 37\u00b0 6\u2032  north latitudes and 68\u00b0 7\u2032 and 97\u00b0 25\u2032  east longitudes), consisting of 28 states and 8 Union Territories54, covering an area of about 32,87,263 sq. km55 ,was chosen as the study area. Indian landmass measures about 3214 km (north\u2013south) and about 2933 km (east\u2013west). India had 275 cities with &gt; 1 lakh (&gt; 0.1 million) population as per last population census conducted in 2011.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fire and FRP data retrieval</emphasis></p><p>Active fire spots captured by VIIRS on NASA/NOAA Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite and processed by NASA\u2019s Fire Information Resource Management System (FIRMS) were extracted and analyzed for every month and year during 2012 to 2023. All the active fire spot data points recorded by VIIRS from the very first day of transmission from the S-NPP satellite in 2012 and archived in NASA-FIRMS Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data product (375 m spatial resolution), were collected (<url normalizedValue=\"https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov\">https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov</url>). Subsequently, information on select parameters viz. geographical coordinates of fire spots, data acquisition date and time, levels of confidence in fire detection (low, nominal, high) and FRP of each fire was extracted from the collected database for detailed analysis and interpretation. In VIIRS, the acquired fire data is screened by a confidence algorithm in which detection confidence levels are set to \u2018low\u2019 (l), \u2018nominal\u2019 (n) and \u2018high\u2019 (h) for designating the quality of individual fire pixels that helps exclude false positive fire occurrences (<url normalizedValue=\"https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/esri2::satellite-viirs-thermal-hotspots-and-fire-activity/about\">https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/esri2::satellite-viirs-thermal-hotspots-and-fire-activity/about</url>). To ensure incorporation of fewer false alarms in analysis, use of only nominal- and high-confidence fire pixels are prescribed, treating the low-confidence fire pixels as \u2018no fire\u2019. On the other hand, maximum fire detectibility is ensured when all three classes of fire pixels are considered56. In this study, all fires including l, n and h confidence levels were analyzed and reported to ensure maximum fire detectability. A certain fire may not get detected by a satellite, if (i) the fire started and ended outside the time frame of satellite overpass (ii) the fire is masked by cloud cover or tree canopy or heavy smoke (iii) when instruments develop glitches (iv) when the fire is too small or too cool to be detected. The onboard bow-tie deletion algorithm in VIIRS helps minimize detection of duplicate fire spots between adjacent scans at off-nadir position, resulting in fewer repeat fire detections than MODIS57. Apart from these general limitations of satellite remote sensing, VIIRS has the following specific limitations in fire detection: (i) Early afternoon orbit of VIIRS leads to large temporal separation between same-day data acquisitions58 (ii) During daytime, potential false alarms are witnessed due to reflected solar radiation from solar panels, hot and bright surfaces, sun glint from small lakes/ponds and clouds. In night, false alarms include hot smoke plumes and reflected solar energy from cloud tops near the terminator59. However, Data verification and validation for VIIRS performed at selected sites across the globe, including specific field campaigns in small-to-medium size (&lt; 500 ha) fires60, showed a good agreement with VIIRS daytime and night-time fire data34, showcasing the reliability of VIIRS as an efficient wildfire sensor.</p><p>The MODIS (Aqua and Terra combined) fire spots were also extracted from FIRMS product parallelly with VIIRS, for the purpose of presenting an inter-comparison of fire spots retrieved by the two instruments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data analysis</emphasis></p><p>The fire counts recorded by VIIRS over 2012\u20122023 were extracted and the numbers of active fires in the most active months were analyzed. The Indian \u2018fire-year\u2019 cycle was constructed from the monthly variation in fire incidences in every year, following the concept proposed by Boschetti and Roy61 that inculcates the logic of calculating a 12 month \u2018fire-year\u2019 cycle from the month of significant escalation in number of wildfires. The concept of fire-year was invoked in this study after preliminary analysis of historical fire data (2012\u20132023) over India. A \u2018fire year\u2019 incorporates a 12 month period, starting from the month of remarkable escalation in fire activity up to the completion of 12 months which may or may not coincide with a calendar year. Therefore, based on wildfire activities, a fire year may be different in different parts of the world. The authors proposed the concept specifically for studying inter-annual variability of fire activity and found that a March\u2013February \u2018Fire Year\u2019 was suitable for studying global fire activity. For the sake of a wider understanding, the \u2018Fire Year\u2019 may be likened to a \u2018Fire Period\u2019 or a \u2018Fire Season\u2019. The respective FRPs (MW) of fires were also extracted and analyzed. Further, inter-annual trends of yearly total fire count, median FRPs and annual sum FRPs of active fires were analyzed and assessed for inter-relationships by Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Method and coefficient of determination (R2) was tested for statistical significance. The year-wise trends of yearly total fire counts, yearly median FRPS and total yearly sum of FRPs over 2012 to 2023 were also analyzed by Sen\u2019s nonparametric slope estimation methods. The COVID years of 2020 and 2021 were ignored for studying the inter-annual trends, considering potential impacts of perturbation in anthropogenic movements and activities during these two years on fires. The true slope of trends were estimated by Sen\u2019s nonparametric method in which the slope is estimated as the median of all pair-wise slopes between each pair of points in the data set62,63. This method has advantages like allowing missing values and non-inclusion of data of any particular distribution. Also, Sen\u2019s method is known to be not remarkably impacted by single data errors or outliers64. Frequency analysis of fire counts in select FRP ranges over the entire study period was conducted to understand the distribution pattern of fire counts under various FRP classes. Cluster analysis by Ward\u2019s Method was performed on the year-wise datasets (n = 12 months under each year) on total fire counts and sum FRPs to identify statistically similar or dissimilar years in terms of total fire counts and sum FRPs, respectively. Ward\u2019s Method, also known as Ward\u2019s minimum variance method, is one of the agglomerative hierarchial approaches used for cluster analysis and is known to be the most suitable for quantitative variables. This approach analyzes the variance of clusters and minimizes within-cluster variance65.</p><p>Spatial distribution of active fire spots in months of highest occurrence in summer (March or April, as found through fire data analysis) and winter (November, as found through fire data analysis) were mapped on Indian landmass by generating shape files from fire coordinates extracted from FIRMS fire product and integrating the layers onto the shape file of India having first and second levels of administrative divisions (country and state borders). Fire density maps were prepared for the months of highest occurrences in summer and winter i.e. March and November of 2022 and March or April and November of 2023 in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids, to delineate gridded fire hot spots over Indian landmass. The density maps were prepared on a GIS platform by dividing the entire study area into 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids followed by geometric processing of number of fire spots appearing in each grid and selective colour marking of grids by creating fire-spot number bins. The shape file of Indian cities having more than 1 lakh population (&gt; 0.1 million) was prepared by extracting the city coordinates reported in India\u2019s last population census database conducted in 2011 and overlaid on fire density maps. These maps facilitated visual assessment of proximity of these busy urban centres to the fire hot spots of various intensities (i.e. with different classes of fire counts), developed in 20 \u00d7 20 sq. km. grids. The major cities and towns within the seasonal hot spots were labeled for easy identification.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussions</emphasis></p><p>Suomi-VIIRS detected far higher number of fires than what Terra and Aqua MODIS together did (Table 1). The numbers of fires detected with nominal and high confidence levels by VIIRS were in the range of 82.1\u201384.2% of all fires in the calendar years of 2012 to 2023 while in MODIS, the fires detected with &gt; 50% confidence level were 79.1\u201381% of total fire counts. The temporal variation in monthly total fire counts during 2012\u20122023 is presented in Fig. 1<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis> showing wide temporal variation in monthly total fire counts over the study period. The summer fire count started to increase remarkably from March every year, peaking either in March itself (2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2021, 2022) or in April (2014, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2023), subsequently declining to reach low numbers by July with ensuing monsoon. At the onset of winter, fire count started to increase again from October onwards, peaking in November and declining thereafter. The fire counts at winter peaks were much lower than summer peaks always, underlining the dominance of summer as the most intense season of fires. Yearly total fire count in 2019 and 2020 were found to have declined to near 2014 and 2015 numbers, possibly reflecting the effect of COVID related slowdown on anthropogenic activities linked to fires.Table 1</p><p>Inter-comparison of yearly (calendar-year) fire counts retrieved by SUOMI-VIIRS and MODIS (Aqua and Terra combined) over Indian landmass.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\"/><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col2\">VIIRS</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col5\">MODIS</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\"/></row><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Calendar year</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Annual total number of all fires (A)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Annual total number of fires detected with n and h degrees of confidence</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">% fires detected with n and h degrees of confidence levels</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Annual total number of all fires (B)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">Annual total number of fires detected with &gt;

Global Forest Watch reported that peak fire season typically began in mid-February in 2024 based on wildfire data extracted from VIIRS. As per IIRS, who used wildfire data extracted from one of the sensors used by NASA-FIRMS to come to a conclusion, forest fire season in Uttarakhand starts from mid-February, characterized by onset of dry weather and increasing presence of drying vegetation as fuel for fire due to rising temperature which persists up to mid-June67. Considering the remarkable escalation in number of fires from March onwards every year in India, as found in this study (Fig. 1), the 12-month cycle of March\u2013February was chosen as the Indian \u2018Fire Year\u2019 or \u2018Fire Season\u2019 for presenting inter-annual variability in fire activity.</p><p>The yearly (fire-year) number of fires ranged from 492,282 (2013\u201314) to 731,154 (2021\u201322). The next two most populated years in terms of yearly fire counts were 2016\u201317 (675,740) and 2018\u201319 (650,765). The yearly total fire counts, found to be fluctuating during 2012\u20122023, had a growth rate of 6022 per year (excluding COVID years of 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322) as per Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method with a R2 value of 0.076 which was found to be statistically non-significant at 5% level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.4381) (Fig. 2). When COVID years were included, fire count growth rate increased to 7217 per year with a R2 value of 0.12, which was also statistically non-significant at 5% level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.2685) (Fig. 3). Sen\u2019s slope, a non-parametric method used to study linear relationships which is not affected by outliers in the datasets62, is shown as an alternative trend along with OLS trend. Cluster analysis of all the years under study, each represented by monthly total fire count in respective year (n = 12), revealed that each member year in the pairs of 2017 and 2023, 2016 and 2022, 2013 and 2014 and 2012 and 2018 were statistically similar to each other (Fig. 4).Fig. 2</p><p>Yearly trends in annual fire count over 2012\u201313 to 2023\u201324 fire-years (without COVID years of ss 2020 and 2021) estimated by OLS and Sen\u2019s Method.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Yearly trends in annual fire count over 2012\u201313 to 2023\u201324 fire-years estimated by OLS and Sen\u2019s Method.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Dendrogram depicting statistically similar and dissimilar years (fire-years) in terms of monthly total fire counts.</p><p>FRP of individual fires fluctuated within a range of near-zero to 1378.6 MW. The histogram of fire counts falling under various FRP ranges during 2021\u20122023 represents a positively skewed distribution, reflecting low number of fires beyond the FRP of 500 MW (Fig. 5). The observed difference in individual FRPs is expected due to the variability in amount of biomass burnt, combustion efficiency, biomass composition and moisture content in biomass68. The OLS trend of median FRPs per fire (MW) over the study period (excluding COVID years of 2020 and 2021) was slightly negative (\u2212 0.027 MW per year) with a statistically significant R2 value of 0.608 at 5% level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.0078) (Fig. 6), indicating negligible but statistically significant trend of reduction in median FRP per fire during study period. When COVID years were included, the decreasing trend of median FRP per fire was observed to be \u2212 0.020 per year with a R2 value of 0.411, which was also statistically significant at 5% level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.0247) (Fig. 7).

The OLS trend of annual sum FRPs (MW) over the study period (excluding COVID years of 2020 and 2021) was 1039 MW per year with a statistically non-significant R2 value of 0.00017 at 5% level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.9717) (Fig. 8). The yearly sum FRPs registered an increasing trend from 2012-13 fire year onwards with a rate of 25,534 MW per year when all years under study were considered (Fig. 9). This linear increasing OLS trend was statistically non-significant with a R2 value of 0.042 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.5204). Sen\u2019s slope is also depicted with the OLS trends.Fig. 8</p><p>Yearly trends in annual sum FRP over 2012\u201313 to 2023\u201324 fire-years (without COVID years of 2020 and 2021) estimated by OLS and Sen\u2019s Method.</p><p>Fig. 9</p><p>Yearly trends in annual sum FRP over 2012\u201313 to 2023\u201324 fire-years estimated by OLS and Sen\u2019s Method.</p><p>There existed a highly significant linear relationship between annual total fire count and annual sum FRPs with a statistically significant R2, both when COVID years were excluded (R2 = 0.839, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.002227) or included (R2 = 0.89, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> value = 0.001119) in analysis (Fig. 10). This relationship was also reiterated by the concomitant variations in fire count with respective FRPs over the study period (Fig. 11). Cluster analysis of study years based on respective monthly total FRPs (n = 12 each year) indicated that the individual years within the pairs of 2017 and 2023, 2014 and 2020, 2016 and 2022, 2012 and 2015 were statistically similar to each other in terms of monthly sum FRPs (Fig. 12). It has been reported by Vadrevu and Lasko69 that sum of FRPs from VIIRS data was 2.5 times higher than MODIS sum FRP, as number of fires detected by VIIRS was more in number in an agricultural landscape. Li et al.26 found that MODIS missed an appreciable number of low-intensity fires in Africa, leading to underestimation of daily MODIS FRP by at least 42.8% than VIIRS FRP.Fig. 10</p><p>Linear variation in sum annual FRPs with total annual fire counts over 2012\u201313 to 2023\u201324 (with and without inclusion of COVID years).</p><p>Fig. 11</p><p>Concomitant fluctuations in monthly sum FRPs with monthly fire counts over 2012\u20132023.</p><p>Fig. 12</p><p>Dendrogram depicting pairs of statistically similar and dissimilar years (fire-years) in terms of sum FRPs.</p><p>In summers of 2012\u20132023, fire spots were mainly populated in Central\u2013South\u2013Eastern part of India. The spots covered parts of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telengana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, also covering parts of North\u2013Eastern Indian states like Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, lower Assam and Nagaland (Fig. 13). In winter, parts of Northern India in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were mostly affected, followed by central and southern parts of India that hosted scattered fire spots (Fig. 14). The conspicuous clustering of fire spots in major rice and wheat cultivating regions of India in summer and winter builds up a strong case in favour of residue burning in the respective crop harvesting seasons that coincide with periods of March\u2013May and Oct\u2013Nov in India, respectively. Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat are the major winter-wheat growing states in India70. For winter wheat, stubbles are removed in summer (March\u2013April\u2013May) and put on fire, resulting in a good number of summer fires. The states of Odisha, Andhra and Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar are known to cultivate summer rice that is harvested around March\u2013April\u2013May71, indicating to the possibility of paddy stubble burning around this time. Apart from CRB, the prominent numbers of summer forest fire events reported by FSI in India also are expected to substantially contribute to the number of fire spots detected by VIIRS in March\u2013April\u2013May. Some fire clusters overlapped with forested regions of India, predominantly dry/moist deciduous and tropical semi-evergreen types72 in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, Nagaland73,74, indicating occurrence of forest and wildfires. Bahuguna and Upadhyay75 reported that about 50% of forest fires of India occurred in NE region and95% of them originated from shifting cultivation. During January 2001 to April 2014, around 143,761 forest fire incidents were detected in NER76. Also, month-wise fire incidences in NER was maximum in April in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Tripura and the minimum in February in all other states, except in Tripura with no fire. States of Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram experienced highest number of fires in March. Overall, the decreasing order of fire incidences was: March (54%) &gt; April (43%) &gt; February (3%) in 2014. In NER, evergreen/semi-evergreen forest had highest susceptibility to fire followed by deciduous forests while alpine forests had least vulnerability. Manmade forest fire caused by shifting cultivation is reported to be one of the primary causes of fire incidences in NER. The fire-prone forest areas in India can be traced from the Van Agni Geoportal of FSI77 which shows extensive coverage of high, very high and extreme fire prone zones in NEIndia especially in states of Tripura, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram. Further, high to extreme fire-prone zones are also located in several patches in states of Odisha, Telengana and Chhattisgarh which are all observed to be affected by fires during 2012\u20132021.Fig. 13</p><p>Indian landmass dotted with fire spots in the months of maximum occurrence (March or April) in summer in each year during 2012 to 2023 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>Fig. 14</p><p>Indian landmass dotted with fire spots in months of maximum occurrence (November) in winter in each year during 2012 to 2023 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>Fire spot density in the worst affected summer and winter months of 2022 (March and November) and 2023 (April and November) were analyzed and mapped in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids over Indian landmass  vis a vis the number of fire spots detected in the grids. The grids can also be designated as fire hot spots of various degrees in terms of fire counts. The locations of cities with &gt; 1 lakh (0.1 million) population were overlaid on Indian landmass to visualize the proximity or overlapping of cities with various classes of fire hot spots hosting specific numbers of fires <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(</emphasis>Figs. 15, 16, 17 and 18). It is observed that many of summer and winter fire hot spots (400 km2 area) indeed hosted some well-known and populated cities. In the winter (November) of 2022 and 2023, well-known cities like Amritsar, Abohar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patiala and Pathankot in state of Punjab were found to be within 400 km2 hot-spot grids (100\u2013750). Further away, Chandigarh, NCR of Delhi, and cities like Hisar, Sonepath, Karnal, Faridabad and Gurgaon in state of Haryana, Nizamabad and Kakinada in Telengana etc. were also located in hot spot grids in either 2022\u201323 or 2023\u201324 and wildfire impacts may also be expected at some of these urban centres. Notably, the said impacts were not measured or assessed but only perceived based on geographical proximity. Several other cities in states of Uttar Pradesh (Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Bareilly, Hapur, Bulandshahar, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Rampur); Madhya Pradesh (Jabalpur, Bhopal, Gwalior); West Bengal (Kulti, Durgapur, Asansol); Dibrugarh and Dispur in Assam; Imphal in Manipur etc. are also located within some prominent fire hot spots either in 2022\u201323 or in 2023\u201324 winter season (Fig. 15-16). There are more number of cities and small towns positioned in an around the wintertime wildfire hot spots that are not separately discussed here.Fig.  15</p><p>Fire hot spots relative to locations of cities with &gt; 0.1 million population in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids over India in the month of maximum detected fire number (Nov.) in winter 2022 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>Fig.  16</p><p>Fire hot spots relative to locations of cities with &gt; 0.1 million population in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids over India in the month of maximum detected fire number (Nov.) in winter 2023 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>On the other hand, some of the well-known and populated cities located near summer fire hot spots were Delhi; Karnal, Sonepat and Panipat in Haryana; Gorakhpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nasik and Nagpur in Maharashtra; Jabalpur, Ratlam, Gwalior, Sagar, Sannai, Bhopal, Sagar, Vidisha etc. in Madhya Pradesh; Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Nellore, Cuddapah etc. in Andhra Pradesh; Chennai and Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu; Trichur in Kerala; Asansol and Durgapur in West Bengal; Dhanbad in Jharkhand; Cuttack and Bhubaneswar in Odisha; Shillong in Meghalaya; Dibrugarh, Guwahati in Assam; Aizwal in Mizoram and Imphal in Manipur etc. There are many other towns and small cities positioned near summertime wildfire hot spots that are not separately discussed here (Fig. 17-18). The proximity of many of these populated towns and cities to the fire hot spots either in 2022 or in 2023 summer season underlines the potential scope of having wildfire-related impacts on environment. FSI\u2019s Van Agni portal provides interactive viewing of forest fires and fire clusters vis a vis forest administrative boundaries, forest type and cover, fire prone forest area etc. in which a user can visualise NRT forest fires detected by MODIS &amp; VIIRS during last three days. The portal also thematically depicts forest fire risk zones based on last several years\u2019 data. The wildfire hot-spot maps provided in this paper demonstrate seasonally classified grids based on number of wildfires that would assist in easy visualization and comparison of highly affected, moderately affected and non-affected grids in terms of various ranges of fire numbers. Importantly, position of populated cities or groups of cities falling within specific grids can be visualized that could possibly indicate the extent of intervention needed for addressing potential short-term local impacts of wildfires in these towns and cities.Fig.  17</p><p>Fire hot spots relative to locations of cities with &gt; 0.1 million population in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids over India in the month of maximum detected fire number (March) in summer 2022 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>Fig.  18</p><p>Fire hot spots relative to locations of cities with &gt; 0.1 million population in 20 km \u00d7 20 km grids over India in the month of maximum detected fire number (April) in summer 2023 (Maps created by QGIS version 3.34.4-Prizren, <url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/download/\">https://qgis.org/download/</url>).</p><p>Studies indicate that wildfires can have measurable and statistically significant effect on urban centres78. In US, a large number of houses were found to have been built since 1990 within or near natural vegetation, in areas designated as the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), and by 2017, about one in three houses and one in ten hectares of land were located in the WUI. This observed growth in WUI in US is expected to aggravate wildfire-related problems on humans and their livelihood in future79. In California during 1985\u20132013, interface WUI areas hosted about 50% of buildings that were destroyed in wildfire, whereas intermix WUI had about 32% of the destroyed buildings80. Chen et al.81 have reported that expanding wildfires and human settlements have put higher number of people and infrastructure within the realm of WUI areas under risk. They estimated that 7.07% (12.54%) of WUI areas, hosting about 4.47 million (10.11 million) people, are coming within a 2400 m (4800 m) buffer zone of wildfire threat.   Countries like United States, Brazil, China, India and Australia have highest share in WUI areas. In case of large wildfires, air parcels can carry smoke to large distances in short time and air quality in urban centers near fire clusters may get affected substantially, as have been reported from India82,83, Australia84, Southeast China85, apart from perturbations in local and regional climate and radiation budgets in a few aggravated cases86. Fire hot spot identification by density mapping technique, as used in this paper, has been deployed by Tonini et al.87 in Portugal also that facilitated easy visualization of the fire hot spots.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Analysis of fire spots and their FRPs during 2012\u20132023 could answer some of the questions posed at the onset of the study. There are yearly fluctuations in wildfire number and total annual FRP and evidences on slight increase in annual fire counts and sum FRPs over 2012 to 2023. But, these trends were found statistically insignificant. But nevertheless, the hint of increase should be viewed with caution due to potentially grave impacts of repeated wildfires on environmental sustainability. There is a clear seasonality in fire incidents, summer being the worst affected season. Winter fires are much lesser in number and mostly centred around specific areas in a few North Indian states viz. Punjab and Haryana followed by Uttar Pradesh. Existence of some populated cities (&gt; 0.1 million population) within fire hot spot grids is apparent, implying the scope of potential impacts of fires on urban life, and air environment. It may be noted that these perceived impacts on nearby urban centres are inferred from proximity of cities to wildfire clusters and not from direct measurement of exposure or effects.</p><p>Studies on positional changes in fire-prone areas over the last decade and likely future scenarios, likelihood of having high-intensity fires in the changing climate, estimation of burnt-areas, mapping of vulnerable WUIs and innovations in fire-resilient living under local conditions are potentially important to know in India through future studies, which were not covered under this study. Other potential additions to this work in future could be to identify and clearly differentiate between fire types and assess the extent of burnt areas, keeping in view the challenge of doing so in a large study domain i.e. the entire Indian landmass. Proactive participation of local inhabitants along with interventions by state administrations are urgently needed to streamline and promote sustainable eco-practices to minimize incidence of natural fires, inadvertently caused fires and arson in India.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The author acknowledges use of VIIRS standard fire products data from the archives of NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), a part of NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).

Prolonged dry conditions statewide stretch back to late last summer, increasing the risk for wildfire in the spring, when weather conditions tend to be dry and windy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"New Jersey experienced significant dryness this past fall, resulting in an extended wildfire season throughout the state in 2024 and providing a sobering reminder that we must be prepared for the spring wildfire season,\" said Governor Murphy. \"It is more important than ever that we share information and continue to work collaboratively to protect lives, properties, and communities.\"</p><p>\"Preparedness is essential, especially as climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of wildfires in New Jersey,\" said Commissioner LaTourette. \"We need to be even more vigilant going into the spring wildfire season and follow the actions of NJ Wildfire SMART, which will help mitigate wildfire risk statewide.\"</p><p>\"The Forest Fire Service works year-round protecting New Jersey communities from the threat of wildfires,\" said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator for Forests &amp; Natural Lands. \"In addition to protecting lives and property, the Forest Fire Service assists with natural disasters, maintains hundreds of miles of roads, works alongside multiple cooperators to develop and implement strategic plans that reduce the risk of future wildfires, and lends their talents to other states when wildfires strike.\"</p><p>\"Meeting with municipal partners ahead of New Jersey's spring fire season is essential to strengthening communication, coordination and preparedness when addressing wildfire risk and responding to developing incidents,\" said Bill Donnelly, Chief of the DEP Forest Fire Service. \"We share the common goal of ensuring New Jersey's communities and forest resources are protected from wildfires, and today's roundtable allows us to proactively address any concerns.\"</p><p>\"Being located in the rural Pinelands and part of the Belleplain State Park area means the threat of forest fires is something we take seriously in Woodbine,\" said Woodbine Mayor Bill Pikolycky. \"I am grateful to Governor Murphy for taking a proactive role in addressing forest fire concerns, especially in light of what is happening in California. Woodbine has had a long relationship with our local and State of New Jersey Forest Fire Wardens and State of New Jersey Forestry Service. We have and continue to offer our airport as a base of operations for the Fire Service to land, refuel, and refill water tanks in the event of fire. We look forward to offering Woodbine and its airport to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service as a training and drill location for strategic planning in containing and fighting forest fires.\"</p><p>\"West Milford's vast and scenic landscape, spanning over 80 square miles, has experienced the serious impact of wildfires firsthand. I was honored to participate in the roundtable discussion and am encouraged by the Administration's commitment to proactive wildfire mitigation. I look forward to continuing our collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the NJ Forest Fire Service to strengthen fire prevention, preparedness, and response efforts. By fostering key partnerships and securing additional funding, we must advocate for the resources needed to protect our residents, first responders, and natural environment. Wildfires recognize no boundaries, making a strong, coordinated approach vital to safeguarding our community,\" said West Milford Mayor Michele Dale.</p><p>\"I recommend increasing 'controlled burn' by our experts at the NJ Forest Fire Service to protect our beautiful acres of the Pinelands,\" said Bass River Mayor Rick Adams.</p><p>\"I think it's very important that the Governor continues to support prescribed burning in the Pinelands. The Pinelands are a very volatile fire area, and what happened in California could very easily happen in the Pinelands,\" said Woodland Mayor William Degroff.</p><p>\"I would like to thank Governor Murphy, Commissioner LaTourette, and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service for their continued support in pre fire planning, including the thinning of fuels to make New Jersey a safer place for our residents,\" said Manchester Mayor Joseph Hankins.</p><p>\"As we watched the once-unimaginable images of the recent wildfires in California and our hearts ached for those impacted, our thoughts also turned to ways we can safeguard our state from similar devastation,\" said Assembly Speaker Craig J. Coughlin. \"Collaboration with local officials will be crucial in developing strategies to strengthen both our preparedness and our response, ensuring that we can effectively protect our communities. Today's roundtable discussion is an important step in that process and I commend Governor Murphy and his administration for proactively engaging stakeholders.\"</p><p>\"As we approach wildfire season, it is crucial that we come together as a community to ensure our state is prepared to face any potential threats,\" said Senator Carmen Amato, Jr. \"Thursday's roundtable discussion with Governor Murphy, DEP Commissioner LaTourette, and local officials is an essential step in strengthening our response efforts and safeguarding our residents. By working collaboratively, we can ensure that New Jersey is ready to protect lives, preserve our natural resources, and mitigate the risks posed by wildfires. I'm proud to be part of this vital conversation and will continue to advocate for the resources and policies needed to keep our communities safe.\"</p><p>\"South Jersey is home to over 1.1 million acres of Pine Barrens, a vital part of our community, and an area that is at an increased risk for forest fires,\" said Assemblywoman Andrea Katz. \"We must be prepared to control any fire. Protecting our region and our natural resources is paramount, and I'm grateful to everyone who gathered today to focus on this critical issue.\"</p><p>\"Wildfires can claim people's lives and have a devastating impact on communities, wildlife, and budgets,\" said Assemblyman Greg Myhre. \"It is critical to support a well-trained and properly equipped forest fire service along with forest management practices that protect our state's forests and nearby communities including the Pinelands National Reserve which covers a large portion of the 9th Legislative District.\"</p><p>\"We must ensure our firefighters have funds and manpower to do what they do best,\" said Assemblyman Michael Torrissi. \"We can't leave them high and dry by denying them the resources they need.\"</p><p>\"Our top priority must be keeping our communities safe, and that includes protecting our citizens from the devastating effects of fires,\" said Assemblyman Brian Rumpf. \"We must invest in robust fire prevention measures, support our brave firefighters, and educate the public on fire safety to save lives and safeguard our homes.\"</p><p>Spring Wildfire Season and Growing Threats from Climate Change</p><p>Spring is typically peak wildfire season in New Jersey. Between mid-March and mid-May, trees and underbrush are still leafing out, relative humidity is generally low, and windy days are common. The combination of these factors means forested lands dry out quickly. Additionally, porous sandy soils in the vast Pinelands region of southern New Jersey do not retain moisture for long, exacerbating drying and making it possible for a fire to spark only hours after rainfall.</p><p>Climate change is making wildfire seasons longer. According to Climate Central, a research nonprofit, nationwide analysis of weather conditions during the past 50 years found that the annual number of fire weather days has risen by 10 days in northern New Jersey and four days in southern New Jersey. This data mirrors the DEP's own 2020 Scientific Report on Climate Change which states, \"wildfire seasons could be lengthened, and the frequency of large fires increased due to the hot, dry periods that will result from increased temperatures.\"</p><p>NJ Wildfire SMART</p><p>Since the onset of the abnormally dry period on Sept. 1, 2024, the Forest Fire Service has responded to 884 wildfires, which collectively burned 4,945.25 acres, a substantial increase over the number of wildfires and acreage burned during the same time period for the three preceding years. Nine of these were classified as \"major wildfires,\" each exceeding 100 acres, and posed a threat to 273 structures combined.</p><p>In recognition of these growing threats, the Forest Fire Service has launched NJ Wildfire SMART (safety, mitigation, awareness, resources, and training), a series of actions that emphasize steps and information resources for reducing wildfire risk and spread.</p><p>Safety : As wildfire seasons grow longer and dry conditions persist, proactive preparedness and strong collaboration are vital to safeguard lives, property and natural resources. Prevention remains the most important part of the equation, as most wildfires can be avoided by adhering to commonsense safety tips. For example, homeowners should remove pine needles, leaves, and other debris from gutters, and smokers are reminded to properly dispose of cigarettes and smoking materials. After using a fireplace or woodburning stove, fully douse ashes with water since both can emit embers that spark fires. Dispose of fully doused ashes in a metal can or cylinder.</p><p>Property owners in wooded areas need to be especially aware of their environment and should take steps such as maintaining defensible barriers, or cleared areas, around structures. They should create space of at least 30 feet between homes and flammable vegetation in forested or wooded areas, and 100 feet from homes in the Pinelands region. These buffers should be free from vegetation that will burn easily, such as fallen leaves, pine needles, twigs and branches. Property owners should also make sure firetrucks can access driveways.</p><p>Visit njwildfire.org for more information.</p><p>Mitigation : The Forest Fire Service is at work throughout the year planning and implementing a variety of forest management projects to further reduce the threat of wildfire. As conditions allow, the Forest Fire Service implements a proactive program of prescribed burns to reduce fallen debris and understory that can fuel wildfires. Fuel breaks, a manmade change in forest fuel characteristics, and firebreaks, a constructed clearing used to stop fires, can both change fire behavior while providing an opportunity to slow or stop the fire. Prescribed fire also improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>Awareness : Information about wildfire risks and mitigation is especially critical for people who live within or adjacent to forested areas, also known as the wildland-urban interface. Information tools the Forest Fire Service has introduced in response to the growing dangers include:</p><p>* The NJ Fire Danger Dashboard, found on the Forest Fire Service website, is updated frequently with a fire danger rating by county, displays a color-coded index of different fire danger ratings and provides a snapshot view of risk by county. The dashboard also displays any current campfire restrictions that may be implemented depending on fire weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged dry periods.</p><p>* The New Jersey Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (NJWRAP) compiles data and resources to assist residents, community leaders and fire professionals in taking actions to mitigate the threat of wildfire risk around their property and in their community. Data and preparedness resources presented in the portal were developed by the nation's wildfire experts, with Forest Fire Service personnel providing practical and local information.</p><p>* The Forest Fire Service also keeps the public informed through its social media platforms on Facebook and X, posting information on wildfires that are deemed major, or at least 100 acres in size; involve structures that are threatened, meaning they are in the vicinity of an active wildfire; or result in road closures. The Forest Fire Service provides updates in real time as necessary, as well as progress on containment status and other key information for public awareness.</p><p>Response : A network of 21 fire towers across the state are critical to the Forest Fire Service's mission of early detection and rapid response to wildfires. Fire Observers, trained in taking weather readings and reading smoke and fire behavior, scan the horizon from the towers looking for smoke, triangulate and pinpoint the location of the smoke with other nearby towers, and dispatch resources to investigate the cause. Fire towers frequently dispatch resources to the source of smoke several minutes before the first 9-1-1 call is placed.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service is the lead agency for all wildland fires in the Garden State and initiates the incident command structure once arriving on scene. Local fire departments may also be requested to assist with establishing water supply or protect improved property and structures while the Forest Fire Service focuses on containment and suppression of the main wildfire.</p><p>Aircraft for observation or suppression may also be deployed in support of wildfire response. The Forest Fire Service maintains a fleet of three Bell UH-1H helicopters for suppression, two Bell 206 Jet Rangers, one Bell 47 and three Cessna fixed-wing aircraft for observation. Additionally, for 30 days each spring, the Forest Fire Service contracts additional fixed-wing aircraft capable of dropping several hundred gallons of water to assist in the rapid response to any wildland fires that may spark</p><p>These activities are directed by fire wardens and staff from a command post that is a central location for communications and deployment of resources, including wildland fire trucks and aircraft.</p><p>Training : The Forest Fire Service's national leadership in implementing prescribed fire and fighting wildfires frequently draws firefighters, students, scientists, and researchers from around the country and world to New Jersey to learn about prescribed burning, the fire adaptability and ecology of the Pinelands region and forest management.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service is committed to field and professional training in all facets of wildfire suppression, the science of firefighting, sharing resources and experience based on the experience gained in the fire-prone Pinelands, and assisting with wildfire response in all parts of the nation.</p><p>For nearly 40 years, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has offered aid to many states - including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. These out-of-state deployments allow Forest Fire Service members to receive national certifications with experience that can be brought home to help protect lives, property, and natural resources in New Jersey.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250213a.shtml\">https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562025/approved/20250213a.shtml</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9052013 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9052013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F46-VK33-RSJ7-T0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2644\"/><timeReceived>8:18 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 13, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are a frequent and destructive phenomenon in Southwestern China, posing significant threats to ecological systems and human lives and property.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Key R&amp;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Beijing Forestry University: \"In response to the growing need for effective forest fire prevention, this study introduces an innovative method for predicting and assessing forest fire risk. By integrating multi-source data, including optical and microwave remote sensing, meteorological, topographic, and human activity data, the approach enhances the sensitivity of risk models to vegetation water content and other critical factors. The vegetation water content is derived from both Vegetation Optical Depth and optical remote sensing data, allowing for a more accurate assessment of changes in vegetation moisture that influence fire risk. A time series prediction model, incorporating attention mechanisms, is used to assess the probability of fire occurrence. Additionally, the method includes fire spread simulations based on Cellular Automaton and Monte Carlo approaches to evaluate potential burn areas. This combined approach can provide a comprehensive fire risk assessment using the probability of both fire occurrence and potential fire spread.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Experimental results show that the integration of microwave data and attention mechanisms improves prediction accuracy by 2.8%. This method offers valuable insights for forest fire management, aiding in targeted prevention strategies and resource allocation.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Integrating Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data for Forest Fire Risk Assessment.

Prolonged dry conditions statewide stretch back to late last summer, increasing the risk for wildfire in the spring, when weather conditions tend to be dry and windy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Jersey experienced significant dryness this past fall, resulting in an extended wildfire season throughout the state in 2024 and providing a sobering reminder that we must be prepared for the spring wildfire season, said Governor Murphy. It is more important than ever that we share information and continue to work collaboratively to protect lives, properties, and communities.</p><p>Preparedness is essential, especially as climate change continues to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of wildfires in New Jersey, said Commissioner LaTourette. We need to be even more vigilant going into the spring wildfire season and follow the actions of NJ Wildfire SMART, which will help mitigate wildfire risk statewide.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service works year-round protecting New Jersey communities from the threat of wildfires, said Greg McLaughlin, Administrator for Forests and Natural Lands. In addition to protecting lives and property, the Forest Fire Service assists with natural disasters, maintains hundreds of miles of roads, works alongside multiple cooperators to develop and implement strategic plans that reduce the risk of future wildfires, and lends their talents to other states when wildfires strike.</p><p>Meeting with municipal partners ahead of New Jerseys spring fire season is essential to strengthening communication, coordination and preparedness when addressing wildfire risk and responding to developing incidents, said Bill Donnelly, Chief of the DEP Forest Fire Service. We share the common goal of ensuring New Jerseys communities and forest resources are protected from wildfires, and todays roundtable allows us to proactively address any concerns.</p><p>Being located in the rural Pinelands and part of the Belleplain State Park area means the threat of forest fires is something we take seriously in Woodbine,said Woodbine Mayor Bill Pikolycky. I am grateful to Governor Murphy for taking a proactive role in addressing forest fire concerns, especially in light of what is happening in California.Woodbine has had a long relationship with our local and State of New Jersey Forest Fire Wardens and State of New Jersey Forestry Service. We have and continue to offer our airport as a base of operations for the Fire Service to land, refuel, and refill water tanks in the event of fire. We look forward to offering Woodbine and its airport to theNew Jersey Forest Fire Serviceas a training and drill location for strategic planning in containing and fighting forest fires.</p><p>West Milfords vast and scenic landscape, spanning over 80 square miles, has experienced the serious impact of wildfires firsthand. I was honored to participate in the roundtable discussion and am encouraged by the Administrations commitment to proactive wildfire mitigation. I look forward to continuing our collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the NJ Forest Fire Service to strengthen fire prevention, preparedness, and response efforts. By fostering key partnerships and securing additional funding, we must advocate for the resources needed to protect our residents, first responders, and natural environment. Wildfires recognize no boundaries, making a strong, coordinated approach vital to safeguarding our community,said West Milford Mayor Michele Dale.</p><p>I recommend increasing controlled burn by our experts at the NJ Forest Fire Service to protect our beautiful acres of the Pinelands,said Bass River Mayor Rick Adams.</p><p>I think its very important that the Governor continues to support prescribed burning in the Pinelands. The Pinelands are a very volatile fire area, and what happened in California could very easily happen in the Pinelands,said Woodland Mayor William Degroff.</p><p>I would like to thank Governor Murphy,Commissioner LaTourette, and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service for their continued support in pre fire planning, including the thinning of fuels to make New Jersey a safer place for our residents,said Manchester Mayor Joseph Hankins.</p><p>As we watched the once-unimaginable images of the recent wildfires in California and our hearts ached for those impacted, our thoughts also turned to ways we can safeguard our state from similar devastation, said Assembly Speaker Craig J. Coughlin. Collaboration with local officials will be crucial in developing strategies to strengthen both our preparedness and our response, ensuring that we can effectively protect our communities. Todays roundtable discussion is an important step in that process and I commend Governor Murphy and his administration for proactively engaging stakeholders.</p><p>As we approach wildfire season, it is crucial that we come together as a community to ensure our state is prepared to face any potential threats, said Senator Carmen Amato, Jr. Thursdays roundtable discussion with Governor Murphy, DEP Commissioner LaTourette, and local officials is an essential step in strengthening our response efforts and safeguarding our residents. By working collaboratively, we can ensure that New Jersey is ready to protect lives, preserve our natural resources, and mitigate the risks posed by wildfires. Im proud to be part of this vital conversation and will continue to advocate for the resources and policies needed to keep our communities safe.</p><p>South Jersey is home to over 1.1 million acres of Pine Barrens, a vital part of our community, and an area that is at an increased risk for forest fires, said Assemblywoman Andrea Katz. We must be prepared to control any fire. Protecting our region and our natural resources is paramount, and Im grateful to everyone who gathered today to focus on this critical issue.</p><p>Wildfires can claim peoples lives and have a devastating impact on communities, wildlife, and budgets, said Assemblyman Greg Myhre. It is criticalto support a well-trained and properly equipped forest fire service along with forest management practices that protect our states forests and nearby communities including the Pinelands National Reserve which covers a large portion of the 9th Legislative District.</p><p>We must ensure our firefighters have funds and manpower to do what they do best, said Assemblyman Michael Torrissi. We cant leave them high and dry by denying them the resources they need.</p><p>Our top priority must be keeping our communities safe, and that includes protecting our citizens from the devastating effects of fires, said Assemblyman Brian Rumpf. We must invest in robust fire prevention measures, support our brave firefighters, and educate the public on fire safety to save lives and safeguard our homes.</p><p>Spring Wildfire Season and Growing Threats from Climate Change</p><p>Spring is typically peak wildfire season in New Jersey. Between mid-March and mid-May, trees and underbrush are still leafing out, relative humidity is generally low, and windy days are common. The combination of these factors means forested lands dry out quickly. Additionally, porous sandy soils in the vast Pinelands region of southern New Jersey do not retain moisture for long, exacerbating drying and making it possible for a fire to spark only hours after rainfall.</p><p>Climate change is making wildfire seasons longer. According to Climate Central, a research nonprofit, nationwide analysis of weather conditions during the past 50 years found that the annual number of fire weather days has risen by 10 days in northern New Jersey and four days in southern New Jersey. This data mirrors the DEPs own 2020 Scientific Report on Climate Change which states, wildfire seasons could be lengthened, and the frequency of large fires increased due to the hot, dry periods that will result from increased temperatures.</p><p>NJ Wildfire SMART</p><p>Since the onset of the abnormally dry period on Sept. 1, 2024, the Forest Fire Service has responded to 884 wildfires, which collectively burned 4,945.25 acres, a substantial increase over the number of wildfires and acreage burned during the same time period for the three preceding years. Nine of these were classified as major wildfires, each exceeding 100 acres, and posed a threat to 273 structures combined.</p><p>In recognition of these growing threats, the Forest Fire Service has launched NJ Wildfire SMART (safety, mitigation, awareness, resources, and training), a series of actions that emphasize steps and information resources for reducing wildfire risk and spread.</p><p>Safety: As wildfire seasons grow longer and dry conditions persist, proactive preparedness and strong collaboration are vital to safeguard lives, property and natural resources. Prevention remains the most important part of the equation, as most wildfires can be avoided by adhering to commonsense safety tips. For example, homeowners should remove pine needles, leaves, and other debris from gutters, and smokers are reminded to properly dispose of cigarettes and smoking materials. After using a fireplace or woodburning stove, fully douse ashes with water since both can emit embers that spark fires. Dispose of fully doused ashes in a metal can or cylinder.</p><p>Property owners in wooded areas need to be especially aware of their environment and should take steps such as maintaining defensible barriers, or cleared areas, around structures. They should create space of at least 30 feet between homes and flammable vegetation in forested or wooded areas, and 100 feet from homes in the Pinelands region. These buffers should be free from vegetation that will burn easily, such as fallen leaves, pine needles, twigs and branches. Property owners should also make sure firetrucks can access driveways.</p><p>Visit njwildfire.org for more information.</p><p>Mitigation: The Forest Fire Service is at work throughout the year planning and implementing a variety of forest management projects to further reduce the threat of wildfire. As conditions allow, the Forest Fire Service implements a proactive program of prescribed burns to reduce fallen debris and understory that can fuel wildfires. Fuel breaks, a manmade change in forest fuel characteristics, and firebreaks, a constructed clearing used to stop fires, can both change fire behavior while providing an opportunity to slow or stop the fire. Prescribed fire also improves habitat for plants and animals, reduces the presence of damaging insects and ticks, and recycles nutrients into the soil.</p><p>Awareness: Information about wildfire risks and mitigation is especially critical for people who live within or adjacent to forested areas, also known as the wildland-urban interface. Information tools the Forest Fire Service has introduced in response to the growing dangers include:</p><p>The NJ Fire Danger Dashboard, found on the Forest Fire Service website, is updated frequently with a fire danger rating by county, displays a color-coded index of different fire danger ratings and provides a snapshot view of risk by county. The dashboard also displays any current campfire restrictions that may be implemented depending on fire weather conditions such as high winds or prolonged dry periods.</p><p>The New Jersey Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (NJWRAP) compiles data and resources to assist residents, community leaders and fire professionals in taking actions to mitigate the threat of wildfire risk around their property and in their community. Data and preparedness resources presented in the portal were developed by the nations wildfire experts, with Forest Fire Service personnel providing practical and local information.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service also keeps the public informed through its social media platforms on Facebook and X, posting information on wildfires that are deemed major, or at least 100 acres in size; involve structures that are threatened, meaning they are in the vicinity of an active wildfire; or result in road closures. The Forest Fire Service provides updates in real time as necessary, as well as progress on containment status and other key information for public awareness.</p><p>Response: A network of 21 fire towers across the state are critical to the Forest Fire Services mission of early detection and rapid response to wildfires. Fire Observers, trained in taking weather readings and reading smoke and fire behavior, scan the horizon from the towers looking for smoke, triangulate and pinpoint the location of the smoke with other nearby towers, and dispatch resources to investigate the cause. Fire towers frequently dispatch resources to the source of smoke several minutes before the first 9-1-1 call is placed.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service is the lead agency for all wildland fires in the Garden State and initiates the incident command structure once arriving on scene. Local fire departments may also be requested to assist with establishing water supply or protect improved property and structures while the Forest Fire Service focuses on containment and suppression of the main wildfire.</p><p>Aircraft for observation or suppression may also be deployed in support of wildfire response. The Forest Fire Service maintains a fleet of three Bell UH-1H helicopters for suppression, two Bell 206 Jet Rangers, one Bell 47 and three Cessna fixed-wing aircraft for observation. Additionally, for 30 days each spring, the Forest Fire Service contracts additional fixed-wing aircraft capable of dropping several hundred gallons of water to assist in the rapid response to any wildland fires that may spark</p><p>These activities are directed by fire wardens and staff from a command post that is a central location for communications and deployment of resources, including wildland fire trucks and aircraft.</p><p>Training: The Forest Fire Services national leadership in implementing prescribed fire and fighting wildfires frequently draws firefighters, students, scientists, and researchers from around the country and world to New Jersey to learn about prescribed burning, the fire adaptability and ecology of the Pinelands region and forest management.</p><p>The Forest Fire Service is committed to field and professional training in all facets of wildfire suppression, the science of firefighting, sharing resources and experience based on the experience gained in the fire-prone Pinelands, and assisting with wildfire response in all parts of the nation.</p><p>For nearly 40 years, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has offered aid to many states including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. These out-of-state deployments allow Forest Fire Service members to receive national certifications with experience that can be brought home to help protect lives, property, and natural resources in New Jersey.</p><p>Governor Phil Murphy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126971661</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F43-RB53-RRKB-X4R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 13, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser 's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy. The recent analyst rating on Weyerhaeuser stock (WY) is a Hold, with a price target set at $28.00.</p><p>According to Spark, TipRanks' AI Analyst, Weyerhaeuser's overall stock score indicates a stable financial position, backed by strong cash conversion capabilities. However, the company faces challenges in revenue and profit growth, and technical analysis suggests a lack of momentum in the stock. Despite these hurdles, Weyerhaeuser's strategic initiatives and commitment to shareholder returns remain positive indicators for investors.</p><p>As the largest private owner of timberlands in North America, Weyerhaeuser operates across various sectors, including timberlands, real estate, energy, and natural resources.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. In 2024, Weyerhaeuser reported net sales of $7.1 billion and employed around 9,400 people globally.</p><p>The Gorman Group, a family-owned business founded in 1951, operates multiple divisions in Southern British Columbia and northern Washington state, employing about 900 individuals. The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 12, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S.</p><p>Press Release article 12 of 12, Source: WEC, 76 words </p><p>November 13 2024: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 20.0c per share for Q3/2024; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q2/2024) dividend of 20.0c. The ex-dividend date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and the record date is Friday, November 29, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, December 13. Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience.

Spring fire season is underway; DEEP received reports of 40 wildfires from April 14 to April 21 alone, totaling approximately 300 acres. Most fires can be prevented because they are caused by human actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of the year, 155 fires totaling approximately 385 acres have been reported to DEEP, compared to 77 fires from January to April in 2024i.e., about double the number of fires. Brush fires are a serious hazard and can threaten lives and infrastructure. Tragically, a firefighter died while responding to a brush fire in fall 2024, and eight other firefighters were injured in 2024 while responding to brush fires. One residential building and seven other structures were lost to wildfire in 2024, and overall, 170 structures and residences were placed at risk for damage from wildfires.</p><p>In spring, deciduous (non-evergreen) trees are bare and the sun gets hotter, heating up and drying out forest fuels such as grass, leaves, twigs, branches, and decaying material in the soil. Grasses, twigs, and small branches in particular are called \"1-hour fuels\" because they can rapidly dry out and become ready to burn. Spring fires typically burn these 1-hour fuels and spread very quickly, especially in windy conditions.</p><p>The majority of wildfires in Connecticut are caused by human actions such as improper burning of debris or poor management of campfires, arson, careless discarding of wood ashes, and placing motorized equipment on top of or adjacent to fire fuels.</p><p>The recent uptick in wildfire occurrence is a strong reminder for residents to be extra vigilant with outdoor fires until trees fully leaf out and provide important shade and local humidity that reduces surface fuel dryness, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Its important to remember that local open burning permits are automatically suspended on days when the fire danger level is high, very high, or extreme. Please be sure all campfires are completely extinguished and wet and cool to the touch before leaving the area and take proper care when extinguishing and disposing of smoking materials.</p><p>DEEP's Forest Fire Control Office urges all who enjoy Connecticut's parks, forests, and open spaces to use fires with caution and heed the following recommendations, especially during forest fire season:</p><p>Obey local laws regarding open fires, including campfires.</p><p>Keep all flammable objects away from fire. Scrape away leaves, twigs, and grass within a 10-foot diameter circle from fire.</p><p>Have firefighting tools nearby and handy.</p><p>Never leave a fire unattended.</p><p>Carefully dispose of hot coal/ashes.</p><p>Drown all fires.</p><p>Carefully extinguish smoking materials.</p><p>For Connecticut homeowners and residents, the following best practices are suggested to protect your family members and home:</p><p>Make a fire-safe zone around your house. Clean flammable vegetation and debris from at least 30 feet around the house and any outbuildings.</p><p>Prune away the lower limbs of evergreens that are within the fire-safe zone. Evergreens catch fire easily during dry periods and burn quickly.</p><p>Remove any limbs which overhang the roof or chimney.</p><p>Regularly remove leaves and needles from gutters.</p><p>Do not store firewood in the fire-safe zone.</p><p>Use fire-resistant roofing materials.</p><p>Make sure firefighters can find and access your home. Mark your house and roads clearly and prune away limbs and trees along your driveway which do not allow fire truck access.</p><p>Have an escape plan-- and practice it.</p><p>Follow state and local open burning laws.</p><p>Stay with outside fires until they are completely safe and extinguished.</p><p>Dispose of wood ashes in a metal bucket, soak them with water before dumping them.</p><p>Local open burning permits are automatically suspended on days when the fire danger level is high.</p><p>Municipal issued open burn permits are automatically suspended if the Daily Forest Fire Danger Index is rated High, Very High, or Extreme.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127108401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN1-FRY3-RW6B-D3J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Beyond their ecological significance, forests are pillars of global food security, offering essential resources such as fruits, seeds, roots, and wild meat, which support indigenous and rural communities. Every year on March 21, the world celebrates the International Day of Forests to celebrate all types of forests, recognize the importance of trees and forests, and take action to protect them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In year 2012, the United Nations declared March 21 as the International Day of Forests (IDF) to celebrate and raise awareness about the vital role of forests. Every year a new theme is chosen by the Collaborative Partnership on Forests. The theme for this year is \"Forests and Food,\" which emphasizes the deep connection between forests and global food security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In India forests are deeply intertwined with culture, economy, and biodiversity, and their protection is not just an environmental necessity but a fundamental responsibility. In this direction, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and related ministries of Government of India have launched various schemes that link forests to food security, nutrition, and livelihoods.</p><p>National Agroforestry Policy</p><p>Agroforestry is a sustainable land-use system that integrates trees and crops to enhance agricultural productivity, improve soil fertility, and provide an additional income source for farmers. Recognizing its potential, the Government of India introduced the National Agroforestry Policy in 2014 to promote tree plantation in farmland.</p><p>Objectives of the Scheme</p><p>The National Agroforestry Scheme aims to encourage farmers to adopt agroforestry for climate resilience, environmental conservation, and economic benefits.</p><p>Implementation Strategy</p><p>The scheme emphasizes the production and distribution of Quality Planting Material (QPM) through nurseries and tissue culture units. The ICAR-Central Agroforestry Research Institute (CAFRI) is the nodal agency responsible for providing technical support, certification, and training. Various institutions such as ICFRE, CSIR, ICRAF, and state agricultural universities collaborate to implement the program effectively.</p><p>Market and Economic Support</p><p>To make agroforestry profitable, the scheme supports farmers through price guarantees and buy-back options for farm-grown trees. It also encourages private sector participation in the marketing and processing of agroforestry products. Additionally, agroforestry integrates well with India's strategy to promote millets, as millets thrive in tree-based farming systems.</p><p>Funding and Support Interventions</p><p>The government provides financial assistance for the establishment of nurseries and research projects.</p><p>Green India Mission</p><p>The Green India Mission (GIM) also known as National Mission for a Green India, is a key part of India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). It is one of the eight missions under NAPCC. The mission aims to protect, restore, and enhance Indias forest cover while tackling climate change. GIM focuses on improving biodiversity, water resources, and ecosystems like mangroves and wetlands, all while helping absorb carbon. The activities under GIM were started in the FY 2015-16.</p><p>Mission Goals:</p><p>Expand forest/tree cover by 5 million hectares (mha) and improve the quality of another 5 mha of forest and non-forest land.</p><p>Boost ecosystem services like carbon storage, water management, and biodiversity.</p><p>Improve livelihoods for 3 million households by increasing income from forest-based activities.</p><p>Sub-Missions:</p><p>GIM has five sub-missions, each focused on a different aspect of greening:</p><p>Enhancing Forest Cover Improving Forest quality and ecosystem services.</p><p>Ecosystem Restoration Reforesting and increasing forest cover.</p><p>Urban Greening Adding more trees in cities and nearby areas.</p><p>Agro-Forestry and Social Forestry Boosting biomass and creating carbon sinks.</p><p>Wetland Restoration Reviving critical wetlands.</p><p>Ecosystem Services Improvement Project (ESIP)</p><p>The Green India Mission is working on the Ecosystem Services Improvement Project (ESIP), a World Bank-backed initiative in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>Funding and Expenditure</p><p>As of July 2024, Rs. 909.82 crores have been allocated to 17 states and one Union Territory for plantation and eco-restoration over 155,130 hectares. In Maharashtra's Palghar district, 464.20 hectares in Dahanu Division have been covered under GIM for plantation and eco-restoration.</p><p>Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme</p><p>The Forest Fire Prevention and Management is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme that supports states and Union Territories in preventing and controlling forest fires. The Ministry provides financial assistance to help implement various fire prevention and management measures.</p><p>India has a forest fire detection system managed by the Forest Survey of India, Dehradun. It uses remote sensing technology to detect and share information about forest fires in near real-time. This system plays a crucial role in the early detection and effective management of forest fires across the country. The Ministry has also constituted a Crisis Management Group under the chairmanship of Secretary (EFandCC) to deal with crises arising as a result of forest fires.</p><p>Objectives of the scheme</p><p>The scheme aims to reduce forest fire incidents and restore productivity in affected areas. It emphasizes the involvement of local communities in forest protection and contributes to maintaining environmental stability. Developing a fire danger rating system and forecasting methods is also a key objective. The scheme encourages the use of modern technology, such as Remote Sensing, GPS, and GIS, to enhance fire prevention efforts. Additionally, it seeks to improve knowledge about the impact and behaviour of forest fires.</p><p>Implementation</p><p>Following the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee and NGTs directions, the Ministry has developed the National Action Plan on Forest Fire. It is based on a study with the World Bank and consultations with key stakeholders like State Forest Departments and the National Disaster Management Authority. In addition to forest fire detection, the Forest Survey of India (FSI), under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, has developed a satellite-based Forest Fire Monitoring and Alert System. This system helps in the timely detection and monitoring of forest fires. Fire alerts are sent via SMS and email to registered users, ensuring quick response and better fire management.</p><p>Van Dhan Yojana</p><p>Launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED, the Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Yojana (PMVDY) aims to improve the livelihood of tribal communities by enhancing the value of forest produce. The scheme helps tribal gatherers become entrepreneurs through skill training, infrastructure support, and market linkages.</p><p>Formation of Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs)</p><p>Under this initiative, tribal communities form Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs), each consisting of 300 members from 15 Self-Help Groups (SHGs). These Kendras serve as hubs for processing, value addition, and marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFPs).</p><p>Financial Support and Implementation</p><p>The scheme is a centrally funded, with a,15 lakh allocated per Kendra. Tribal members contribute a,1,000 each to ensure ownership. The government also supports branding, packaging, and global market access for tribal products.</p><p>Two-Stage Implementation</p><p>Stage I: Establishment of 6,000 Kendras across tribal districts with basic facilities.</p><p>Stage II: Scaling up successful Kendras with better infrastructure, such as storage and processing units.</p><p>Impact and Benefits</p><p>PMVDY generates sustainable livelihoods, promotes forest conservation, discourages tribal migration, and strengthens the tribal economy, making it a key initiative for Indias tribal development.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Indias commitment to forest conservation and sustainable development is evident through various initiatives like the National Agroforestry Policy, Green India Mission, Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme, and Van Dhan Yojana. These programs not only help restore and protect forest ecosystems but also enhance livelihoods, promote climate resilience, and strengthen food security. On International Day of Forests 2025, it is crucial to reaffirm our dedication to preserving forests as vital resources for future generations. By integrating conservation efforts with community participation and sustainable policies, India continues to pave the way for a greener, healthier, and more prosperous future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127040046</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCJ-G8T3-S1KW-W36M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 20, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On the 4th of September 2025, Weyerhaeuser released presentation materials for investors, emphasizing its commitment to disciplined capital allocation and sustainable practices.</p><p>The company set forth several key targets, including a significant $1 billion investment in timberlands by 2025. Additionally, Weyerhaeuser aims to grow its annual EBITDA from natural climate solutions to $100 million and increase lumber production by 5% each year. These targets reflect Weyerhaeuser 's focus on fostering growth while prioritizing environmental sustainability.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser also reiterated its leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, with a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Furthermore, the company is committed to maintaining robust shareholder returns through a sustainable dividend policy.

This transaction, initially announced in May, includes the transfer of Weyerhaeuser's associated timber licenses in British Columbia, which are expected to be finalized in the coming months, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions.</p><p>As part of the sale, Weyerhaeuser received approximately $60 million USD upfront, with additional proceeds tied to the transfer of the timber licenses. The company has recognized a gain from the sale but anticipates a tax liability of about $11 million USD as a result of the transaction. This sale reflects Weyerhaeuser's ongoing strategy to optimize its operations and focus on its core business areas.</p><p>Established in 1900, Weyerhaeuser is among the largest private owners of timberlands worldwide, managing approximately 10.4 million acres in the U.S. and additional public timberlands in Canada. The company is recognized for its commitment to sustainability, operating all its timberlands in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. In 2024, Weyerhaeuser reported net sales of $7.1 billion and employed around 9,400 people globally.</p><p>The Gorman Group, a family-owned business founded in 1951, operates multiple divisions in Southern British Columbia and northern Washington state, employing about 900 individuals. The company is well-regarded for its high-value lumber products, particularly in the home finishing and renovation markets. The acquisition of Weyerhaeuser's mill aligns with Gorman Group's long-term strategy of enhancing its operational capabilities and market presence.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's decision to divest its Princeton mill is part of a broader trend in the timber industry, where companies are reassessing their portfolios to focus on areas with higher growth potential.</p><p>Press Release article 3 of 12, Source: WEC, 75 words </p><p>August 12: Weyerhaeuser quarterly dividends steady</p><p>Weyerhaeuser today announced a quarterly dividend of 21.0c per share for Q2/2025; unchanged from the previous quarter (Q1/2025) dividend of 21.0c.

Through a free online resource hub, first responders can find specially designed content, including videos about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and suicide prevention, along with mental health tips, educational articles and contacts for occupationally aware support groups and counselors in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.</p><p>Weyerhaeuser's support for wildland firefighting efforts in the Pacific Northwest began in the aftermath of the Yacolt Burn in 1902, when the company began advocating for Washington's first forest fire legislation and the funding of community fire prevention education and patrols. Today, as Weyerhaeuser celebrates its 125th anniversary, the company continues to play an active role in fire prevention and response through its forest management operations. Weyerhaeuser employees and contractors receive annual fire readiness training, build fire breaks and containment lines, conduct aerial surveys and deploy tanker trucks, helicopters and quick-response crews to wildland fires.</p><p>\"After launching the Fighting Fires Together campaign with FBHA four years ago, we're proud to continue this effort to support wildland firefighters and their mental health as they work in challenging conditions to protect our communities,\" says Bill Frings, vice president of Western Timberlands for Weyerhaeuser.</p><p>Press Release article 7 of 12, Source: Company Website, 299 words </p><p>May 22: Weyerhaeuser Acquiring High-Quality Timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia</p><p>Capitalizing on unique off-market opportunity to further enhance Southern Timberlands portfolio with highly productive and strategically located acreage</p><p>SEATTLE, May 22, 2025 - Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today announced an agreement to acquire approximately 117,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia from Roanoke Timberlands LLC, a subsidiary of Roseburg Forest Products, for $375 million. Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.</p><p>Key attributes of the acquisition:</p><p>Located in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

Total dividends per share paid in the 12 months ended November 14 were 79.0c.</p><p>SECTION 5 WEYERHAEUSER 10-Q: 12 CONSEQUENTIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS</p><p>Strategic Expansion of Engineered Wood Products Capacity</p><p>Management has committed $500 million to constructing a new TimberStrand facility in Monticello, Arkansas, beginning in 2025, with operations expected by 2027. This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 6 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS</p><p>6.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield</p><p>Dividend Yield &gt; 2/3rd Bond Yield:</p><p>The dividend yield of 3.34% is 0.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.18%; it is also above the benchmark of 2/3rd set by Benjamin Graham. </p><p>(All figures in %)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dividend Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bond Yield</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.18</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spread</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.84</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The Dividend Yield of 3.3% is better than the Index average of 1.9%</p><p>- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 3.3%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index of 1.9% is 176.7%.

'The fire came violently to this area, there is nothing left to burn.

Billhimer, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette and Ocean Township Chief of Police Michal Rogalski announced that on April 23, 2025, Joseph Kling, 19, of Ocean Township (Waretown), was charged with Aggravated Arson and Arson in connection with a wildfire that started in Waretown on April 22, 2025, and continued to spread throughout the southern Ocean County area.</p><p>On April 22, 2025, at approximately 9:45 a.m., the Cedar Bridge Fire Tower located a column of smoke coming from the area of Jones Road and Bryant Road in Ocean Township. Upon arrival, emergency personnel observed a fire within the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust's Forked River Mountains Wilderness Area, which is on the east side of Jones Road.</p><p>As of April 24, 2025, the fire has burned approximately 15,000 acres in Waretown and Lacey Townships, and has destroyed a commercial building.</p><p>A thorough and extensive investigation conducted by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit-Arson Squad, New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Ocean County Fire Marshal's Office, and New Jersey State Fire Marshal's Office, plotted the origin of the fire via Global Positioning System (GPS). The cause of the fire was determined to be incendiary by an improperly extinguished bonfire.</p><p>Further investigation has revealed that Kling was the individual responsible for setting wooden pallets on fire - and then leaving the area without the fire being fully extinguished. Kling was taken into custody at Ocean Township (Waretown) Police Headquarters; he was thereafter transported to the Ocean County Jail, where he is presently lodged pending a detention hearing.</p><p>Prosecutor Billhimer, Commissioner LaTourette and Chief Rogalski acknowledge the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit-Arson Squad, Ocean County Prosecutor's Office Major Crime Unit, New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Ocean Township (Waretown) Police Department Detective Bureau, Lacey Township Police Department Detective Bureau, Ship Bottom Police Department, New Jersey State Fire Marshal's Office, Ocean County Fire Marshal's Office, and Ocean County Sheriff's Office Crime Scene Investigation Unit, for their combined and cooperative efforts in connection with this investigation.</p><p>*Rest of the document can be viewed at: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ocponj.gov/waretown-man-charged-with-aggravated-arson-and-arson-in-connection-with-jones-road-wildfire/\">https://ocponj.gov/waretown-man-charged-with-aggravated-arson-and-arson-in-connection-with-jones-road-wildfire/</url>) For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USFDNW-PR5032928</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USFDNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FN6-SJ63-S622-61VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">282801</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><timeReceived>7:24 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 HT Media Ltd.

According to news reporting from the University Gadjah Mada by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Mapping forest fires became one of the efforts to reduce the fire vulnerability.\" </p><p><br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University Gadjah Mada: \"Spatial model development for fire vulnerability could employ a GIS-based information value model (IVM) that excels in predicting vulnerability by leveraging hotspot inventory data. However, this model remained relatively unexplored. This research aimed to develop a fire vulnerability model of peatland-dominated areas in West Kalimantan Province and identify biogeophysical factors that significantly influence fire vulnerability in the research area. The IVM employed hotspots, accessibility, land cover, distance to settlements, distance to rivers, soil types, peat types, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) parameters. The results revealed that the medium hazard class dominated forest and land fire vulnerability in West Kalimantan Province (272,663 ha). In addition, the average annual hotspot intensity from 2012 to 2022 negatively correlated with annual rainfall.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Factors such as the brackish water topogen peat type, podzolic-cambisol soil type, accessibility, shrub land cover, and NDVI collectively contributed to the high level of vulnerability.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Mapping of Forest Fire Vulnerability Using Information Value Model in West Kalimantan Province.

As platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) govern the flow of information through opaque algorithms and profit-driven content curation, societies worldwide face the dual challenge of platform domination and information disorder. Traditional regulatory and educational frameworks have struggled to respond effectively to these transformations. As a result, media literacy has emerged as a strategic and necessary policy response to empower citizens, especially youth, with the critical skills needed to navigate, interpret, and engage responsibly with digital content.</p><p>This article explores media literacy not merely as a pedagogical tool, but as a crucial element of democratic resilience and information governance. It traces the evolution of media literacy from its early focus on broadcast media to its current relevance in algorithmically structured and socially networked environments. The article argues that media literacy policy must be robustly integrated into national education systems, public institutions, and platform accountability frameworks. Drawing on international case studies\u2014including Finland, Canada, and the European Union\u2014the discussion highlights successful policy approaches that address both the cognitive and civic dimensions of media literacy. However, it also emphasizes the limitations of isolated initiatives and the need for holistic, inclusive, and culturally adaptive strategies. In conclusion, the article proposes a multi-stakeholder roadmap for advancing media literacy policy in the digital age. This includes government leadership, platform cooperation, educational reform, and the active engagement of civil society. Only by embedding media literacy into the core of democratic policy responses can societies mitigate the harms of information disorder and reclaim agency over their digital environments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry-Peter/publication/393786924_Media_Literacy_Policy_as_a_Response_to_Platform_Domination_and_Information_Disorder/links/6879f64bf312d71d78c82702/Media-Literacy-Policy-as-a-Response-to-Platform-Domination-and-Information-Disorder.pdf</url></p><p>The Industry</p><p>Canadian and French media producers strengthen partnerships and open new paths for transatlantic content</p><p>Back to all press releases \u2013 25/3/2025</p><p>TORONTO, March 25, 2025 \u2014 France\u2019s Union Syndicale de la Production Audiovisuelle (USPA) and the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) today announced their joint delegation of producers from France and Canada, participating in a dedicated mission to explore coproduction opportunities for drama and documentary projects.</p><p>The delegation will first travel to Series Mania in Lille, France, and then head to Paris, where participants will meet with potential collaborators, as well as commissioners, studio execs, and other industry leaders, equipping themselves with the tools for future partnerships.

Heightened economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and the prospect of a global recession are weighing on consumer confidence. In addition, the decline in BCE's share price has resulted in a higher cost of capital. The Board also considered the impact of the unsupportive regulatory environment given recent CRTC decisions, ongoing aggressive competitive pricing, and a slowdown in immigration.</p><p>Greater financial flexibility and a prudent approach to capital management is required in the current economic, regulatory and competitive environments. Accordingly, the Board has determined to establish the annualized dividend at $1.75 per BCE common share. In addition, BCE's common share dividend payout policy has been updated to target a dividend payout range of 40% to 55% of free cash flow. In order to allow investors to consider the effects of lease liability repayments on our cash available for dividend payments, we will also going forward be disclosing both free cash flow and free cash flow after payment of lease liabilities13.</p><p>This measure is expected to strengthen the Corporation's balance sheet, while providing enhanced flexibility in the context of economic uncertainty. BCE's Board has declared today a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per common share, payable on July 15, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2025.</p><p>BCE also announced today that the Board has determined to terminate the discounted treasury issuances under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan effective from the July 15, 2025 dividend payment date.

The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $6.9 million (14.5%), circulation revenue of $3.2 million (9.7%) and parcel revenue of $0.9 million (7.2%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $2.6 million (31.9%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the quarter increased by 5.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $4.6 million, or 4.6%, for the quarter ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase relates to increases in distribution and production expense, partially offset by decreases in compensation and other operating expense. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $6.0 million or 6.1%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $5.3 million, an increase of $3.8 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the quarter was $3.2M.</p><p>Net income in the quarter ended May 31, 2025 was $7.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $15.9 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, and an increase in foreign</p><p>currency exchange gains, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, and a decrease in gains on derivative financial instruments.</p><p>Year to Date Operating Results</p><p>Revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $330.3 million as compared to $302.8 million in the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $27.5 million (9.1%). The revenue increase was primarily due to increases in advertising revenue of $19.5 million (13.7%), circulation revenue of $8.7 million (8.9%), parcel revenue of $0.8 million (2.1%), partially offset by decreases in other revenue of $1.5 million (6.2%). Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, advertising revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 increased by 4.2%.</p><p>Total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring increased $9.5 million, or 3.2%, for the nine months ended May 31, 2025, relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase relates to increases in distribution, production and other operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and newsprint expenses. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and restructuring decreased $22.7 million or 7.6%.</p><p>Operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring for the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $20.6 million, an increase of $18.0 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring is due to an increase in total revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring. Excluding the impact of the Saltwire asset acquisition, operating income before depreciation, amortization and restructuring in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $15.1 million.</p><p>Net loss in the nine months ended May 31, 2025 was $32.6 million, as compared to a net loss of $46.6 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net loss was primarily the result of a decrease in depreciation, amortization, restructuring, net financing expense and an increase in gains on disposal of assets held for sale and other assets, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in gain on derivative financial instruments.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/\">https://www.postmedia.com/2025/07/10/postmedia-reports-third-quarter-results-12/</url></p><p>Quebecor Group (TSX: QBR.A)</p><p>The parent company of the Quebecor Group is the Canadian company, Quebecor Inc.

The Corporation continues to make progress, gaining market share quarter after quarter while consolidating its position as the most profitable player in the sector, supported by the strongest balance sheet in the Canadian telecommunications industry.</p><p>Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor</p><p>Quebecor posted solid financial results in the first quarter of 2025, including increases of 8.1% in cash flows provided by operating activities and 13.5% in adjusted income from operating activities. As a result of this strong performance, driven by rigorous disciplined management, we were able to reduce our consolidated net debt by more than $155.0 million in the first quarter of 2025 and lower our consolidated net debt leverage ratio to 3.26x at March 31, 2025, the lowest among Canada\u2019s major telecommunications providers.</p><p>In an aggressively competitive business environment, our innovative range of products offered at competitive prices allowed us to deliver an increase of 54,400 (1.3%) new mobile lines in the first quarter of 2025, the best growth rate among Canada\u2019s leading telecommunications providers, and 367,500 (9.6%) lines over the past twelve months. We continued investing in our network, in line with our priority of delivering a superior customer experience. Since April 2025, we have been gradually deploying 3800 MHz spectrum across Freedom\u2019s 5G+ network in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. With access to state-of-the-art 5G+ technology now included in all Freedom monthly mobile plans, regardless of price, this rollout will significantly boost network capacity and performance. In February 2025, Freedom also launched a new range of mobile plans in Manitoba that offer higher data caps and include \u201cRoam Beyond\u201d international roaming.</p><p>Freedom brand awareness is also growing. Freedom is an official sponsor of the 2025 Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s most iconic cultural events; the exceptional exposure to millions of attendees and television viewers will strengthen its national positioning.</p><p>We are also proud of the resounding success of Fizz TV, the all-digital television service we launched in February 2025. Available to Fizz Internet subscribers in Qu\u00e9bec, Fizz TV meets the needs of customers seeking flexibility, accessibility and innovation. More than 12,000 new customers signed up in just a few weeks, confirming the relevance of our offer and the appeal of the Fizz brand in a fast-changing market.</p><p>Videotron continued to pick up distinctions, ranking as the most respected telecommunications company in Qu\u00e9bec for the 19th time since 2006 in L\u00e9ger\u2019s 2025 Reputation survey. It also hit a double in L\u00e9ger\u2019s WOW 2025 index, in which it ranked first among telecom retailers for in-store experience in Qu\u00e9bec while Fizz was first in Canada for online experience for the sixth year in a row. Freedom moved up to third place for online experience.</p><p>Although its current restructuring plans have reduced operating expenses considerably, TVA Group Inc. (\u201cTVA Group\u201d) recorded negative adjusted EBITDA of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 as a result of a significant ongoing decline in advertising revenues due to the general crisis in the media industry and fewer major foreign productions filming at our MELS studios. We must therefore maintain a rigorous approach in order to meet the current challenges and safeguard the future of the business.</p><p>Even though TVA Group gained market share, climbing to a total of 42.4% in the Winter 2025 season (January 6 to April 6, 2025), our advertising revenues continued to decline. Our platforms deliver considerably more viewing hours than the American platforms, but advertisers continue to pour their dollars into the latter. Yet their reliability pales in comparison with the credibility of local media, which offer advertisers an unrivalled showcase and reach their target audiences more effectively. As we have repeatedly argued, we believe that the federal government must eliminate the tax deduction for advertising spending on foreign platforms and, conversely, introduce a tax deduction for investment in domestic businesses. At a time when the proliferation of fake news on social media is widely condemned, it defies logic that our public institutions continue to encourage foreign platforms and our governments support them through unfair favourable tax treatment.</p><p>Moreover, as private broadcasters struggle to survive in an over-regulated, over-taxed and loss-making broadcasting environment with a long-obsolete business model, the federal government must move quickly to implement the recommendations of the 2020 Yale Report by reforming CBC/Radio-Canada and its mandate, in particular by eliminating advertising in order to support private broadcasters, for which it is the main source of revenue.</p><p>I would like to mention the upcoming retirement, on May 14, of Lyne Robitaille, Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines, and a valued contributor for the past 36 years. Lyne has had a remarkable career. Over the years, she has led the development and growth of several Quebecor subsidiaries. She oversaw a number of major transformations at Quebecor, including the digital transition of our newspapers, which made Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al and Le Journal de Qu\u00e9bec the most-read newspapers in Qu\u00e9bec across all platforms, with over 3.1 million readers per week. On behalf of Quebecor, I wish her all the best in her well-deserved retirement.</p><p>In April 2025, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pierre P\u00e9ladeau, Quebecor launched a year-long tribute to honour the memory of its founder, a visionary builder of Qu\u00e9bec Inc. who helped transform and modernize Qu\u00e9bec society and its economy. This anniversary is also a reminder that the philanthropic commitment that was so important to Pierre P\u00e9ladeau remains central to Quebecor\u2019s values, as our recent historic donations\u2014$20 million to Universit\u00e9 Laval to support the Carrefour international Brian-Mulroney and $10 million to the Fondation du CHU de Qu\u00e9bec to support its integrated cancer centre\u2014eloquently demonstrate. Several other events will follow in the course of the year.</p><p>Today, the innovation, ambition and courage to think big that we inherited from Pierre P\u00e9ladeau continue to drive our growth and expansion. Extending our track record of successful execution, we are maintaining rigorous financial discipline and building on solid foundations to achieve our objectives and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025\">https://www.quebecor.com/en/-/qu-c3-a9becor-inc.-annonce-ses-r-c3-a9sultats-consolid-c3-a9s-pour-le-premier-trimestre-2025</url></p><p>Rogers Communications Inc.

(\u201cShaw\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022.</p><p>Selected Financial Highlights</p><p>Fourth quarter consolidated revenue decreased 1.5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 1.6% year-over-year to $624 million, funds flow from operations decreased 5.3% to $487 million, and net income decreased 32.9% to $169 million.</p><p>Fiscal 2022 consolidated revenue decreased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Fiscal 2022 results include year-over-year growth in Consumer Internet, Wireless service and Business revenue, offset by declines in Wireless equipment and Wireline Video, Satellite and Phone revenue. The prior year results included Consumer revenue of approximately $20 million related to the release of a provision following the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decision on final aggregated Third Party Internet Access (TPIA) rates and higher equity-based compensation costs of approximately $29 million due to the significant increase in Shaw\u2019s share price following the Rogers-Shaw Transaction (as defined below) announcement on March 15, 2021. Throughout the year, management continued to invest in its networks, focus on profitable subscriber growth and support the Proposed Transaction (as defined below).</p><p>\u201cAs Canadians put the COVID-19 pandemic behind them, the need to connect, and stay connected, has remained strong. The Canadian and global communications sectors \u2013 both wireline and wireless \u2013 face important and rapidly escalating investment demands where ongoing investments today determine our competitiveness tomorrow. That is true for our networks, and also for our country. All Canadians depend on our industry to make the necessary investments so that they can benefit from technology advances and all the opportunities afforded by our digital economy,\u201d said Brad Shaw, Executive Chair &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Mr. Shaw continued, \u201cThat is why it is so important to move forward with the transactions that Shaw, Quebecor and Rogers have agreed to in direct response to concerns raised by the Competition Bureau and ISED. Our proposed series of transactions creates an unprecedented opportunity to enable a strong, fourth wireless carrier that can compete at scale against the Big 3 and with 5G. The proposal also ensures that Shaw\u2019s wireline business can make the significant investments it needs to remain competitive over the long term. In short, we are proposing a bright future for sustainable competition in Canadian telecommunications. Instead of moving ahead with the investments and long-term planning that will drive more competition, we are unfortunately delayed by litigation with the Competition Bureau. Despite this, we remain optimistic that we will ultimately be able to complete our proposed transactions, and we are unwavering in our conviction that they represent a victory for all stakeholders, especially Canadian consumers. We maintain our strong commitment to the ongoing process, and to ensuring that Canada continues to have a vibrant and competitive industry with world leading infrastructure.\u201d</p><p>Proposed Transaction</p><p>On March 15, 2021, Shaw announced that it entered into an arrangement agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d) with Rogers Communications Inc. (\u201cRogers\u201d), under which Rogers will acquire all of Shaw\u2019s issued and outstanding Class A Participating Shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares (\u201cClass B Shares\u201d) in a transaction valued at approximately $26 billion, inclusive of approximately $6 billion of Shaw debt (the \u201cRogers-Shaw Transaction\u201d).</p><p>Holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (other than the Shaw Family Living Trust, the controlling shareholder of Shaw, and related persons (collectively, the \u201cShaw Family Shareholders\u201d)) will receive $40.50 per share in cash. The Shaw Family Shareholders will receive 60% of the consideration for their shares in the form of Class B Non-Voting Shares of Rogers (the \u201cRogers Shares\u201d) on the basis of the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021, and the balance in cash. As at March 13, 2021, when the Arrangement Agreement was signed, the value of the consideration attributable to the Class A Shares and Class B Shares held by the Shaw Family Shareholders (calculated using the volume-weighted average trading price for the Rogers Shares for the 10 trading days ending March 12, 2021) was equivalent to $40.50 per share.</p><p>The Rogers-Shaw Transaction is being implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). At the special meeting of Shaw shareholders held on May 20, 2021, the Company obtained approval of the plan of arrangement by the holders of Shaw\u2019s Class A Shares and Class B Shares in the manner required by the interim order granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta on April 19, 2021. On May 25, 2021, the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Alberta issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement.</p><p>Agreement to Sell Freedom Mobile to Quebecor</p><p>On June 17, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor Inc. (\u201cQuebecor\u201d) announced their agreement for the sale of Freedom Mobile Inc. (\u201cFreedom\u201d) to Quebecor for a purchase price of $2.85 billion. On August 12, 2022, Rogers, Shaw and Quebecor entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d) for the sale of Freedom to Videotron Ltd. (\u201cVideotron\u201d), a subsidiary of Quebecor, substantially consistent with the terms announced on June 17, 2022 (the \u201cFreedom Transaction\u201d). The Freedom Transaction is subject to regulatory approvals from the Commissioner of Competition (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d) and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), and is conditional on the completion of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction. Subject to satisfaction of all conditions, closing of the Freedom Transaction will take place immediately before the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.  Collectively, the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, the Freedom Transaction and all transactions provided thereunder are referred to as the \u201cProposed Transaction.\u201d</p><p>The Share Purchase Agreement provides that Videotron, a subsidiary of Quebecor, will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Freedom. Accordingly, Videotron will acquire the entire Freedom business, including all Freedom-branded wireless and Internet customers, as well as all of Freedom\u2019s infrastructure, spectrum and retail locations, and all of Freedom\u2019s existing backhaul and backbone arrangements. The Freedom Transaction also includes long-term agreements pursuant to which Rogers will provide Quebecor with transport services (including backhaul and backbone) and roaming services. Rogers and Quebecor will provide each other with customary transition services as are necessary to operate Freedom\u2019s business for a reasonable period of time post-closing and to facilitate the separation of Freedom\u2019s business from the other businesses and operations of Shaw and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, the Shaw Mobile-branded wireless subscribers will not be transferred to Videotron and will remain with Shaw.</p><p>Status of the Proposed Transaction Regulatory Approvals and Related Proceedings</p><p>For the Rogers-Shaw Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the parties made filings with each of the Canadian Radiotelevision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Commissioner and ISED in April 2021. For the Freedom Transaction, consistent with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the parties made filings with the Commissioner and ISED in June 2022.</p><p>On March 24, 2022, the CRTC completed its comprehensive review and approved the transfer of Shaw\u2019s licenced broadcasting undertakings to Rogers, marking an important milestone towards closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction.</p><p>On May 9, 2022, the Commissioner filed applications to the Competition Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) seeking an order to prevent the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from proceeding and an interim injunction to prevent closing until the Commissioner\u2019s case can be heard by the Tribunal. On May 30, 2022, the Commissioner\u2019s interim injunction application was resolved on the basis that Rogers and Shaw agreed to not proceed with closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Tribunal has ruled on the matter. As announced by the Company on July 6, 2022 and October 27, 2022, the respective mediation sessions between Rogers, Shaw, Quebecor and the Commissioner in July, 2022 and October, 2022, did not result in a resolution of the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the proposed merger.  As a result, the Tribunal hearing began on November 7, 2022.</p><p>On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry (the \u201cMinister\u201d) officially denied the application for the wholesale transfer of Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Rogers, which is no longer being proposed.  In connection with his ongoing review of the pending application to transfer Freedom\u2019s spectrum licences to Videotron, the Minister gave notice that any spectrum licences acquired by Videotron must remain in Videotron\u2019s possession for at least ten years and the Minister conveyed his expectation that prices for wireless services in Ontario and Western Canada would be comparable to what Videotron is currently offering in Quebec. Videotron subsequently announced that it is willing to accept these conditions.</p><p>The parties to the Proposed Transaction strongly believe that it is in the best interests of Canadian consumers, businesses and the Canadian economy. Above all, the Proposed Transaction will strengthen competition in Canadian wireless and wireline telecommunications and enhance sustainable competition over the long term.  It will also enable network expansion, bridging the digital divide, and the next-generation wireless and wireline networks that will drive innovation and economic growth.</p><p>As previously disclosed, in order to permit continued engagement with the pending regulatory approval processes and related hearings, Rogers, Shaw and the Shaw Family Living Trust have agreed to extend the outside date for closing the Rogers-Shaw Transaction from July 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 which outside date may be further extended to January 31, 2023 at the option of Rogers or Shaw, demonstrating their commitment to completing this transformative combination. The outside date in the Share Purchase Agreement also tracks the outside date in the Arrangement Agreement but can be extended beyond January 31, 2023 only with the consent of Videotron. Nonetheless, the time required to complete the Tribunal hearing, as well as receive ISED approval, including any appeals of the outcomes of any required regulatory process, is uncertain and could result in further delays in or prevent the closing of the Rogers-Shaw Transaction and the Freedom Transaction.</p><p>Further information regarding the Rogers-Shaw Transaction is contained in the management information circular filed April 23, 2021 on Shaw\u2019s SEDAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url> and EDGAR profile at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p>Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Company added approximately 52,900 new Wireless customers. Postpaid net additions of approximately 25,600 in the quarter were down compared to the prior year due to wireless competition and moderating demand for Shaw Mobile, partially offset by increasing retail traffic for Freedom Mobile, although not yet to pre-pandemic levels. Wireless service revenue growth of 7.3% is due to continued subscriber growth, partially offset by lower ARPU1. Fourth quarter Wireless ARPU decreased 0.9% from the prior year period to $37.08. Wireless postpaid churn2 of 1.39% improved approximately 10-basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.</p><p>Consumer Wireline RGU3 losses in the fourth quarter of approximately 42,500 improved over the prior year period, led by Internet RGU additions of approximately 4,700, combined with fewer Video and Phone losses, primarily due to improved retention tactics. Fourth quarter Wireline revenue decreased 2.4% over the prior year to $1.03 billion and Wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 1.4% to $501 million.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireless revenue increased 1.2% to $325 million and adjusted EBITDA of $123 million increased 16.0% year-over-year. For the twelve-month period, Wireless revenue grew 1.5% to $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $485 million improved 23.4%. Wireless service revenue for the three and twelve-month periods increased 7.3% and 9.1% respectively, to $250 million and $972 million, over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 due to an increased subscriber base, partially offset by lower ARPU. Wireless equipment revenue for the three and twelve-month periods decreased 14.8% and 16.3% respectively, to $75 million and $319 million over the comparable periods in fiscal 2021. Fourth quarter ARPU decreased 0.9% to $37.08 reflecting Shaw Mobile customer additions offset by lower device subsidy allocations. For the full year, ARPU of $36.83 decreased 1.4% over the prior year. In fiscal 2022, the Company added approximately 160,000 Wireless customers bringing its total customer base to approximately 2.28 million.</p><p>Wireline RGUs declined by approximately 40,400 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 45,400 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The current quarter included a gain in Consumer Internet RGUs of approximately 4,700 offset with declines in Video, Satellite and Phone resulting in Consumer RGUs declining by 42,500 in the aggregate. Business RGUs increased by approximately 2,100.</p><p>Fourth quarter Wireline revenue of $1.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $501 million decreased 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. Consumer revenue of $879 million decreased 3.4% compared to the prior year as Internet revenue growth was offset by declines in Video, Satellite and Phone subscribers and revenue. Business revenue of $155 million increased 4.0% year-over-year with Internet revenue growth and continued demand for the Smart suite of products.The decrease in revenue was partially offset by lower employee related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 of approximately $11 million due to the impact of share price movements on stock-based compensation as well as favourable adjustments to employee benefit provisions based on experience.</p><p>For the twelve-month period, Consumer revenue decreased 3.2% to $3.55 billion and Business revenue increased 6.7% to $623 million resulting in Wireline revenue of $4.17 billion, or 1.9% lower than the prior year. Wireline adjusted EBITDA for the same period of $2.05 billion decreased 2.8% due primarily to lower Consumer revenue.</p><p>Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of $340 million compared to $292 million in the prior year. Wireline capital spending increased by approximately $85 million primarily due to higher investments in network upgrades, enhancements and success-based categories as well as an increase in new housing development. Wireless spending of $34 million decreased by approximately $37 million year-over-year primarily due to lower planned investment in the quarter. In fiscal 2022, consolidated capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion increased approximately 7.7% from the prior year.</p><p>Free cash flow4 for the quarter of $70 million compared to $227 million in the prior year. The decrease was largely due to higher capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 of $819 million was $154 million, or 15.8%, lower than the prior year due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher income taxes paid partially offset by growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Funds flow from operations for the quarter of $487 million decreased 5.3% from $514 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the decrease in net income and partially offset by a decrease in non-cash future income tax recovery. Funds flow from operations for fiscal 2022 of $2.0 billion was $257 million, or 11.4%, lower than the prior year primarily due to a higher current income tax and interest expense, partially offset by an increase in EBITDA all in the current year.</p><p>Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of $169 million decreased 32.9% from $252 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to an $83 million increase in income taxes in the quarter, primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income for fiscal 2022 of $764 million was $222 million lower than the prior year primarily due to a $29 million increase in interest expense related to a $35 million reduction of tax related interest expense in the prior year and a $211 million increase in income taxes in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the $34 million increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Tax expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to a $125 million revision to liabilities for uncertain tax positions that became statute barred in 2021 as well as the recognition of a $78 million tax benefit associated with previously unrecognized tax losses in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by management\u2019s expectations that sufficient future taxable profit will be available to fully utilize such losses, partially offset by the effect of higher pre-tax income.</p><p>As at the end of fiscal 2022, the net debt leverage ratio was 2.2x5.</p><p>Shaw files Year-End Disclosure Documents</p><p>Shaw announced today the filing with Canadian securities regulators of its 2022 audited annual consolidated financial statements, related management\u2019s discussion and analysis and 2022 annual information form and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its 2022 annual report on Form 40-F which includes the Canadian filings.</p><p>These documents are available on Shaw's profile on the Canadian Securities Administrators' website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>).

According to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, July 2025 was the third warmest July globally, after2023 and 2024.<br/>Southeastern Europe suffered heat waves and forest fires, with a record temperature of 50.5\u00b0C in Turkey.<br/>Outside Europe, the highest temperatures compared to average were recorded in the Himalayas, China and Japan, according to the monthly bulletin of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All heat-related deaths are preventable</emphasis><br/>The WMO Deputy Secretary-General stressed that while extreme heat is often referred to as a \"silent killer,\" with today's science, data and technology, that claim is unfounded.<br/>\"All deaths from extreme heat are preventable,\" Ko Barrett said.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Model-based projections indicate that between 2000 and 2019 there were about 489,000 heat-related deaths each year, 45% of which occurred in Asia and 36% in Europe.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The figures, however, would be an underestimate as it is recognized that official diagnoses and reports of heat-related illnesses, injuries and deaths are not documented to their full extent.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest fires</emphasis><br/>Extreme heat has fueled catastrophic wildfires, costing lives and deteriorating air quality.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Firefighters in Cyprus, Greece and Turkey battled wildfires that forced residents to flee their homes, caused deaths and filled the sky with dense plumes of smoke.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>While the blaze that broke out Tuesday in a forest near the seaside resort of Tarifa in Spain's far south has stabilized, fires continue to ravage the French department of Aude.

As of August 3, more than 6.6 million hectares had burned, according to the Canadian Interagency Wildfire Centre. This is above the 25-year average of approximately 2.2 million hectares, but remains below the more than 12.3 million hectares burned by this time in 2023, a record year.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half a million people die annually</emphasis><br/>Extreme heat is already the deadliest natural hazard on the planet, surpassing earthquakes, floods and hurricanes in deaths, according to the SONAR 2025 report from Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers.<br/>But this phenomenon is just one part of a much broader and more complex picture of emerging risks that are putting the insurance industry and the global economy under pressure.<br/>The study reveals that half a million people die each year from extreme heat events, which have also become more frequent, intense and prolonged.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In 2024, the three hottest days in recorded history were experienced and more than 6 billion people experienced at least one month of extreme temperatures.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>These events affect public health by increasing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and especially harm vulnerable groups such as the elderly and pregnant women.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In addition, extreme heat impacts critical infrastructure, from data centers to power grids, and generates conditions conducive to wildfires with insured losses of US$78.5 billion over the last decade.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>The heat has triggered an increase in insurance claims in various areas, from medical and life to agricultural and property policies, complicating the management and financial balance of the sector.<br/>On the other hand, the Swiss Re report warns of another less visible, but equally dangerous risk: the growing distrust of consumers towards insurers.<br/>In Europe, only half of customers trust their insurers to deliver in the event of a natural disaster claim, a situation that could undermine the very basis of this business based on the promise of protection and support.<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Adding to this list of challenges are new concerns such as the health and legal impact of microplastic and plastic pollution, which could trigger lawsuits similar to those faced by tobacco or asbestos, representing an unexplored front for insurers in liability and health.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The report also addresses emerging risks such as the proliferation of resistant and toxic fungi, the increase in fraud linked to artificial intelligence technologies and deepfakes, and the health effects of the growing consumption of ultra-processed foods.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>The accelerated advance of artificial intelligence has also generated a 60% increase in incidents related to system failures, which challenges insurers to design new products and clauses for this type of technological risks.<br/>Patrick Raaflaub, Swiss Re's chief risk officer, notes that \"risks are becoming increasingly interconnected and the insurance industry must broaden its vision to adapt to a world where extreme heat, liability and technology converge.\"<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">50.5\u00b0C in Turkey and steady rainfall in parts of Germany</emphasis><br/>Turkey has set a new national temperature record. According to the Environment Ministry in Ankara, 50.5\u00baC was measured in Silopi in southeastern Turkey, the highest temperature ever recorded in the country.

The deaths, caused among other things by cardiovascular arrests, are suspected to have been related to the high temperatures. Northern Italy is currently suffering from heavy storms, caused by the large temperature difference between the hot south and the cool north.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>Parts of Croatia, meanwhile, have been hit by violent storms. The most dramatic scenes were witnessed in the Adriatic coastal town of Karlobag, where roads were completely flooded and strong winds and torrential rains were recorded.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Massive rainfall in southern parts of Germany</emphasis><br/>In Germany, however, the weather situation is worsening, especially in the south and southwest of the country, although stormy gusts are also expected in the North Sea. Heavy rain with thunderstorms are still expected in Bavaria. According to DWD meteorologists, up to 30 liters of rain per square meter could fall in isolated areas.<br/>On Saturday, about 100 liters of rain per square meter fell in Nuremberg in three hours. According to the fire department, more than 300 emergency calls were received in the afternoon. The emergency services had to respond to some 150 incidents, mostly due to flooded basements. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is also experiencing heavy rain and isolated thunderstorms.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unprecedented heat wave hits Europe</emphasis><br/>Scientists insist that Europe is the fastest warming continent in the world.<br/>European land temperatures have risen some 2.3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, almost twice the global average, intensifying heat waves, says the European Union's Copernicus climate service.<br/>The specialized climate change publication Carbon Brief also warns that 2025 could be the second or third warmest year on record in recent human history.<br/>The area burned this summer far exceeds the long-term average, with fires in Spain, Portugal and Greece since the end of June, the data show.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">France, on red and orange alert</emphasis><br/>France put 12 departments on red alert, the highest heat warning in the country.

The envelopes with the bids of possible awardees were not opened, but if they had been, it would have been a very short task: only one company had presented itself, so 18 of the 20 lots offered were left deserted. 134.16 million euros in contracts to provide helicopters and amphibious and cargo aircraft for the 2024, 2025 and 2026 campaigns.</p><p><br/>Ataire contested the tender documents because the prices offered did not include the \"industrial benefit\" in the flight hours and the companies were required to meet higher maintenance criteria than those provided for in the regulations, as well as a maximum number of pilots and co-pilots that it considered unjustified. They were also required to supply fuel to third parties at the bases. In March 2024, the TARC ruled in favor of the ministry on all points except fuel.<br/>Ecological Transition then had to re-tender the contracts, but for this it used the negotiated procedure without advertising. According to the department, the reason was the proximity of summer, the period of maximum fire risk, and that the committee that coordinates the State Forest Fire Plan decided to bring forward the start of the campaign to June 1. The law also allows the use of this procedure, in which a limited number of companies are invited to bid, with which the conditions are negotiated, and which is practically a hand-picked award, when a bidding process is not successful. In addition, it allows contract prices to be increased up to a maximum of 10%.<br/>Thus, six tenders were opened through the urgency procedure, by which 50 aircraft were contracted -32 helicopters, four amphibious planes, eight cargo planes and four coordination and observation planes- for the 2024 summer campaign.<br/>And, indeed, the prices were higher, due to \"the additional costs associated with the commissioning and rental, on an urgent basis and only for the summer campaign\" of these aircraft. However, the Ministry does not specify the amount of this increase.<br/>Once the summer campaign was over, Ecological Transition re-tendered the three-year tender, again with an open and ordinary procedure. And it raised the prices of the contracts again. As it explains in the justification report included in the documentation that the ministry has published on the State Procurement Platform, the amounts increased by an average of 43.5%: 37% for medium helicopters for brigade transport, 46% for amphibious planes and helicopter bombers, and 45% for cargo planes.<br/>This price increase is in addition to the 53.6% improvement in the prices of the tender suspended at the beginning of 2024 compared to the previous one, according to the report. At that time, \"the significant increase in aircraft acquisition, maintenance and fuel costs\" had been taken into account. Thus, the price of medium helicopters for brigade transport, amphibious aircraft by 26%, amphibious aircraft by 105% and cargo aircraft by 30% had been improved.<br/>In other words, in one year and three tenders, the prices offered had shot up by 97.1%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other tenders that have been abandoned</emphasis><br/>It is not uncommon for some tenders or lots of the tenders called by the ministry or the autonomous communities to be deserted. In 2019 it happened with two of the six lots of the three-yearly Ecological Transition tender -23.27 million euros-, and likewise only one company, Babcock -now Avincis-, applied for the other four lots. The two lots that were not awarded were also put out to tender through the negotiated procedure without advertising.<br/>For its part, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha left six of the seven lots that made up the tender for its Infocam plan for the years 2025, 2026 and 2027 without awarding them, because no bids had been submitted. The tender budget amounted to 61.16 million. In the Balearic Islands, a tender for 621,120 euros to cover for two years the service provided by a coordination and observation aircraft was cancelled in January 2024, also because no company had submitted a bid. This aircraft had been supplied since 2020 by Mart\u00ednez Ridao Aviaci\u00f3n SL, after two successive extensions -265,324 euros each year-. As it could not be awarded in 2024, the contract was extended for a third time - for nine months - with Mart\u00ednez Ridao, which was paid 241,834 euros more. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The \"cartel of fire\" agreed to leave a tender deserted</emphasis><br/>Some of the main operators of this sector were condemned by the Audiencia Nacional, in a sentence of last February, for rigging public tenders for 20 years. The so-called fire cartel was made up of Avincis, Pegasus, Mart\u00ednez Ridao Aviaci\u00f3n, Avialsa -today Titan Firefighting Company- and two extinct companies, Trabajos A\u00e9reos Extreme\u00f1os and Trabajos A\u00e9reos Espejo. One of the facts that the sentence considers proven and for which these companies and a dozen of directors and senior officials of the Catalan and Valencian governments were condemned was precisely the pact by which the cartel intentionally left deserted a 2004 Ministry tender to contract two amphibious aircraft and one cargo aircraft, distributed in two lots. The amount of the tender was 2.34 million euros.<br/>The objective of the cartel was to inflate the final price, as revealed by the minutes of the meetings and communications between the businessmen involved. Thus, the Ministry re-tendered the service, but through a negotiated tender without advertising. And including a 10% increase in the amount of the tender, as allowed by the Public Administration Contracts Law. The Ministry invited Pegasus, Avincis, Avialsa, Mart\u00ednez Ridao Aviaci\u00f3n and Trabajos A\u00e9reos Espejo to tender. They then agreed to make only two bids, one for each lot. A joint venture formed by Cegisa -today integrated in Avincis- and \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez Ridao, which offered 1.65 million euros, participated in the first one. For the second, Trabajos A\u00e9reos Espejo submitted a bid of 691,330 euros. Both bids did not represent any drop with respect to the starting price and were awarded the contract. \"With this tactic, the cost charged to the Administration was artificially inflated by 234,133 euros,\" explains the sentence.<br/>The court determines that the operative of the fire cartel was to \"wrest\" maximum prices from the contracting bodies, \"at the expense of the public treasury\" and \"without alternative, for the contracting Administration\". This activity, carried out over 20 years, \"is equivalent in practice to the domination of the market in this sector and the systematic elimination of free competition in public tenders\" called in Spain, the court stresses.<br/>Therefore, it adds, the damage caused goes beyond the amount overcharged to the ministry for the tender that was declared void and was re-tendered for those 234,133 euros more, although that is the only amount that the judgment has been able to specify and claim. Because the distortion of free competition in the sector - \"which is the real damage\", the sentence states-, is \"impossible to quantify\", regrets the National Court. At least, that was the statement made by the technicians of the Intervenci\u00f3n General de la Administraci\u00f3n del Estado (IGAE) before the judges: \"Given the collusive practices committed, it is impossible to know which other companies could have competed and obtained the award, and to calculate the economic damage to the public administration\". The only losses measured and recognized in the sentence are the 1.89 million euros that Avialsa should pay to the Generalitat Valenciana for three invoices for non-contracted services that were unduly paid by a high-ranking official bribed by the scheme.<br/>In the supporting memorandum of the last three-year tender put out to tender by Transici\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica, the ministry itself recognizes that the aerial firefighting sector constitutes a \"de facto monopoly or oligopoly\", made up of a \"small number of aircraft manufacturers and operating companies\". The lawyers of the fire cartel corroborated this in the trial before the National Court, where they admitted that the accused companies held 70% of the market. It was one of their arguments to claim that they should be reduced from one year to one month the time in which they are sanctioned by prohibiting them from contracting with the State: if they could not do so, the administrations would be left without aircraft to extinguish fires.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Not going to tenders, the only tool.</emphasis><br/>\"In Spain there are more companies [dedicated to extinguishing fires with aircraft] than in any other country in Europe,\" replies D\u00e1maso Castej\u00f3n Amenedo, secretary general of the employers' association Ataire, when the oligopoly is mentioned to him. Until now, \"the only market\" was Spain and, to a lesser extent, Portugal. The Iberian Peninsula was where most fires broke out, a situation that has begun to change in recent years due to climate change. Spain's fleet of 250 helicopters and airplanes is the best in Europe and one of the best in the world, boasts D\u00e1maso Castej\u00f3n.<br/>What the head of Ataire does recognize is that there are companies specialized in certain models of aircraft, which limits the supply. \"This is not construction\", he describes, \"companies have to bet on certain models or brands, you cannot have an infinite portfolio of models\". Moreover, this is a \"very investment-intensive\" sector, both in aircraft -an Air Tractor aircraft costs five million euros, he points out- and in human capital -a pilot's qualification costs 35,000 euros-, which is an important \"entry barrier\" for new companies.<br/>He also denies that Ataire members have \"lobbying capacity\" because of the administrations' dependence on that small number of companies to cover an essential service. \"As Ataire, we have very little,\" he reaffirms. Nor to \"determine prices\". \"But, if they are low, the only tool that the companies have is not to go to the tenders\", he replies with respect to those that remain deserted. D\u00e1maso Castej\u00f3n says that these have been \"very few in the last 15 years\". And if the airline operators don't show up, it is because of the low prices and because now there is an international market for the Spanish ones: \"They don't have aircrafts [with which to bid] because they have them abroad\". Some 60 or 70 Spanish aircraft are now working in other countries, he estimates.<br/>In fact, as he points out, in Portugal, Greece, Turkey and France, contract prices are double the Spanish ones and the conditions -which have an impact on the price- are also better. There are already Spanish companies that obtain 20% or 30% of their business abroad, he points out. The head of Ataire recognizes that both the ministry and the autonomous communities have raised the budgets for tenders, but even so, they are still lower than in Spain.of European prices.<br/>Ataire dissociates itself from the pact that gave rise to the fire cartel and left a tender void in order to inflate its price: \"It is a story of many years ago, pending confirmation by the Supreme Court\". Now the airline employers' association is dedicated to analyzing the specifications of public tenders - \"all of them can be challenged\" - but only appeals those whose conditions \"do not make sense\" and, in its opinion, are contrary to aeronautical and contracting regulations. But it never appeals prices, says its general secretary, who confesses that he does not like to file appeals because \"they delay awards\". However, he says that Ataire has won 40% of those it has filed, \"in the autonomous communities, above all.\" \"We try not to appeal, actually. We send a letter to the contracting body first, which sometimes works.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-72470896</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GKV-9W53-RY44-J10H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2025 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 27, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Pol\u00edtica</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000388</classCode><className>CONTRACTS &amp;

Amateur \"ham\" radio is a thriving technical hobby with members active all over the world. Hams often operate from remote locations, and several of them wound up in the right place at the right time while preparing to participate in the 2025 ARRL June VHF Contest.</p><p>Robert \" Bobby \" Debevec, W6IWN, and Jacob T . \" Jake \" Graham, KC7WXD, both ARRL members from the Reno, Nevada area, were hiking on the Grouse Ridge Trail in California, a section of the Tahoe National Forest. In addition to getting ready for the contest, they had hoped to also activate several Summits on the Air (SOTA) locations. Their day of using the Amateur Radio Service for recreation was going well until they saw smoke near the Black Buttes area and had to use it for its utility value.</p><p>Debevec captured the event on video, and posted it to his YouTube channel.</p><p>\"I was surprised to see smoke ahead of us,\" said Graham. \"As we got closer, it was clear there had been a lighting hit several days ago and we could also see flames.\"</p><p>Wireless service is spotty in portions of the eastern Sierra, and they didn't have a cell signal, so Debevec used his handheld ham radio to report the fire on a nearby repeater. In just seconds, Dan Patterson, W6AI, responded back. He was monitoring the Nevada County Amateur Radio Club linked repeater system in Grass Valley, California, and heard the call. He took the GPS coordinates from Graham and notified the U.S. Forest Service.</p><p>\"We were monitoring the U.S Forest Service and it only took about 10 minutes for them to dispatch a helicopter to the area,\" said Graham. \"We watched four firefighters rappel down followed by a pack of equipment. The pair then walked closer to the area and started talking to the crew, who thanked them for the report.</p><p>\"They put the out the fires but radioed for a helicopter water drop, before they left on foot, with the gear, to a nearby pickup site,\" added Debevec.</p><p>After the firefighters left, the winds picked up dramatically. Had that happened earlier, the outcome could have much worse. Amateur radio serves communities before and When All Else Fails, and having a thriving group of trained operators active in amateur radio allowed it to facilitate emergency communications that saved the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1127190078</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G2H-WG53-RRMS-P4R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 16, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
