Here, we introduce Forest Fire Clustering, an efficient and interpretable method for cell-type discovery from single-cell data. Forest Fire Clustering makes minimal prior assumptions and, different from current approaches, calculates a non-parametric posterior probability that each cell is assigned a cell-type label. These posterior distributions allow for the evaluation of a label confidence for each cell and enable the computation of \u201clabel entropies\", highlighting transitions along developmental trajectories. Furthermore, we show that Forest Fire Clustering can make robust, inductive inferences in an online-learning context and can readily scale to millions of cells. Finally, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches on diverse benchmarks of simulated and experimental data. Overall, Forest Fire Clustering is a useful tool for rare cell type discovery in large-scale single-cell analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the era of single-cell sequencing, there is a growing need to extract insights from data with clustering methods. Here, inspired by forest fire dynamics, the authors devise an algorithm that can cluster single-cell data with minimal prior assumptions and can compute a non-parametric posterior probability for each data point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis>Clustering analysis is an important statistical method with many application scenarios. In single-cell sequencing, clustering analysis groups individual cells into subtypes, such as categorizing subtypes of cancer cells for targeted therapy1,2. However, single-cell sequencing measurements are sparse and uncertain, and solely categorizing cells into different groups is not enough to develop a statistical view of the cell identity3. In addition to clustering, we should also quantify the confidence of cell-type labels assigned to each cell. Indeed, one of the biggest challenges in single-cell sequencing analysis is validating a computational analysis method4.</p><p>Most current clustering methods can be roughly grouped into five general categories: centroid-based, distribution-based, connectivity-based, density-based, and graph-based methods5. Centroid-based clustering methods, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means clustering, rely on optimizing a central vector to find data clusters6. In distribution-based clustering methods, clusters are defined as samples from certain distributions (e.g., Gaussian distributions in Gaussian mixture models)7. Connectivity-based clustering methods, also known as agglomerative or hierarchical clustering, iteratively merge data points into the same group based on linkage to form a hierarchical structure8. Similar to linkages in connectivity-based methods, density-based clustering methods, such as DBSCAN and OPTICS, produce clusters based on reachability9,10. Graph-based methods, such as Louvain and Leiden, maximize the modularity to find communities in the data graph (e.g., the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph)11,12. These methods can discover the number of communities or clusters in the data indirectly specified by the resolution hyperparameter.</p><p>Overall, a suitable clustering algorithm for single-cell data should have these three important features:</p><p>A single-cell clustering algorithm should make relatively weak assumptions about the data (e.g., the shape of the data) for rare cell-type discovery. Each clustering method makes certain assumptions about the data distribution, in part reflected by their hyperparameters. The number and strength of the assumptions influence the clustering results. A number of well-known clustering methods (such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means and Gaussian mixture models) make relatively strong prior assumptions about the data, which can bias and mislead investigators to overlook rare but important cell types. For example, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means is biased toward identifying equal-sized clusters, which may result in rare cell types being hidden among a larger group4. Indeed, previous works have suggested that these rare cell types could challenge many of our assumptions about data distribution and cellular composition13,14. Comparatively, the resolution parameter in Louvain is a weaker assumption than the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means. Therefore, a clustering method should have a small number of hyperparameters while making minimal assumptions about the data.</p><p>A single-cell clustering method should have the ability to internally validate its clustering results. Currently, only hierarchical clustering can perform internal validation by testing whether a particular cluster exists in the data using bootstrap resampling techniques15. Potentially, a more interpretable and useful statistic is the probability of having the label at each point. In single-cell analysis, this probability could be understood as a confidence measure for the cell type of each cell.</p><p>A single-cell clustering algorithm should be computationally efficient. As the number of cells sequenced continues to grow, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets can have more than a million cells, and clustering once on such a large dataset can take days16. Therefore, it is important to design a scalable clustering algorithm for large single-cell datasets.</p><p>To meet these specifications, we developed Forest Fire Clustering inspired by self-organized criticality in forest fire dynamics. By modeling label propagation similar to the spread of forest fires, we can cluster data given only a \u201cfire temperature\" hyperparameter, similar to the resolution hyperparameter in Louvain. Through simulating label propagations from different starting points, we can compute point-wise posterior exclusion probabilities (PEP), similar to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> values, to quantify the probability that a data point takes on the other cluster labels. We can also compute the point-wise label information entropy to measure the general uncertainty of the labels at each data point. Lastly, Forest Fire Clustering can be used for online clustering, which is a useful feature for analyzing high-throughput data. As experimental data accumulate over time or as data stream over a network, the computational cost of re-clustering continues to rise as the number of cells sequenced increases. Due to the inductive nature of the algorithm, Forest Fire Clustering can make online inferences on a small number of newly arrived data points without re-clustering.</p><p>Here, we provide an overview of Forest Fire Clustering and show how it performs against other clustering methods. However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of our algorithm because ground-truth labels are hard to obtain for unsupervised tasks. Therefore, we applied two general strategies to benchmark the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of Forest Fire Clustering. First, we simulated synthetic and scRNA-seq data from known distributions with ground-truth labels, and we compared clustering labels to ground-truth labels using metrics such as the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and the purity score. Second, we benchmarked Forest Fire Clustering against other clustering methods on different single-cell sequencing technologies, tissues and data scales with labels generated by marker genes, cell-surface antibodies, jointly profiled scATAC-seq (single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing), and subject matter experts (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). With these strategies, we demonstrate the utility of Forest Fire Clustering in discovering rare cell types, highlighting transition cells in developmental pseudotime, and making accurate online inferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Method overview</emphasis></p><p>The main idea of Forest Fire Clustering is to envision data points as trees in a forest and cluster labels as fires that repeatedly propagate through the forest. Modeling forest fire dynamics generates interpretable clusters by iteratively propagating labels through the data manifold. To minimize prior assumptions, the algorithm has only one effective hyperparameter that indirectly governs the number of clusters discovered. In addition, a point-wise posterior label distribution for internal validation is constructed by simulating label propagations from random starting points via Monte Carlo.</p><p>There are three main steps in the Forest Fire Clustering algorithm:</p><p>Preprocessing: The data matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">W</emphasis></emphasis> with rows as cells and columns as genomic features is used to compute the cell-to-cell pairwise  distance matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M</emphasis></emphasis>. Then, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M</emphasis></emphasis> is transformed into an affinity matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis></emphasis> using the kernel method (Fig. 1a, Steps 1\u20132). The affinity matrix serves as the adjacency matrix of the data graph, with data points as vertices and similarities as edges. With only local affinities, the data graph connects data points to reflect global relationships and represents the data geometry in a low-dimensional manifold. The data graph can be approximated with a KNN graph, and an adaptive kernel can be used to accurately capture both the local structure and the long-range interactions between data points.</p><p>Label propagation: On the data graph, a random unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> is selected as a seed to take on a new label (Fig. 1a, Step 3). Each unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> has a label acceptance threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, which is defined as the inverse of its degree. In dense regions of the graph, where the vertices have higher degrees, the inverse relationship results in lower label acceptance thresholds. Thus, highly connected vertices can accept and propagate labels more easily, and vertices in dense regions tend to be in the same cluster. The labeled seed <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> radiates label influence <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> (or heat) to all other unlabeled vertices <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> computed by multiplying the user-defined \u201cfire temperature\u201d parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> with the affinity <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>. Hence, the farther the unlabeled vertices are from the seed, the less label influence they experience. If the average label influence  from all labeled vertices on the unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> exceeds the acceptance threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, then vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> takes on the label of the seed (Fig. 1a, Steps 4\u20135). Even if  is not high enough to cross the threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, it is possible to cross the threshold as more vertices are labeled later on (Fig. 1a, Steps 6\u20137). Therefore, Forest Fire Clustering checks the remaining unlabeled vertices each time new vertices are labeled until the average label influence cannot exceed the threshold of any unlabeled vertices (Fig. 1a, Step 8).</p><p>Iterative label propagation: New label propagations are iteratively performed until all vertices have been labeled, and each round of label propagation defines a cluster (Fig. 1a, Steps 9\u201310). Between rounds of label propagation, labeled vertices from the previous rounds are considered to be exhausted and can no longer be replaced by new labels. By doing so, nonlinear clusters in the data manifold can be found by propagating labels in the data geometry. Sparse regions in the data manifold form natural cluster boundaries, which can be outlined by iterative label propagation.</p><p>We can evaluate the confidence of Forest Fire Clustering labels using Monte Carlo simulations (Fig. 1c). After performing Forest Fire Clustering, we store the initial clustering results <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis>1...<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> for all <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> vertices. Then, a posterior label distribution for each data point can be constructed using label permutations. In each permutation, a random seed vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is selected, and the seed vertex takes on the same label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> as it did in the initial clustering results. Labels on all other vertices are cleared. The seed label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is allowed to propagate until the average label influence can no longer cross the threshold of the remaining unlabeled vertices. Vertices that accepted the seed label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> add one occurrence of that seed label in their records. We repeat with another randomly chosen seed vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> with a seed label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>, which could come from a different initial cluster than the previous seed (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> \u2260 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>). After many Monte Carlo trials, the accepted seed labels are tabulated at each data point to construct a discrete label frequency distribution, which we call the posterior label distribution.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illustration of Forest Fire Clustering and Monte Carlo validation.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Illustration of Forest Fire Clustering. In the data-preprocessing stage, a KNN data graph is created by transforming the pairwise distances into affinities using adaptive kernels (Steps 1\u20132). Then, a vertex is randomly selected as the seed to take on a label (Step 3). The label is allowed to propagate to other vertices by determining if the average label influence crosses the threshold at each vertex (Steps 3\u20138). Lastly, the process is iteratively repeated until all vertices have been given a label (Steps 9\u201310). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Pseudo-code for the Forest Fire Clustering algorithm. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Posterior label distributions are computed for each data point. Labels are repeatedly propagated from random seed vertices with the same set of parameters. For each point, the labels over all Monte Carlo trials are collected to construct an empirical posterior label distribution, which can be used to compute the posterior exclusion probability and the label entropy.</p><p>Similar to the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference, the posterior label distribution is an updated probability distribution over the labels of a data point after accounting for new information from the Monte Carlo simulations. The posterior exclusion probability, which quantifies label confidence using the posterior label distribution, is defined as the posterior probability that a data point accepts the other labels rather than the initial label. Similar to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> values, the posterior exclusion probability is a simulated, retroactive probability that the initial label was not accepted across all Monte Carlo trials. Having a high posterior exclusion probability means that the initial label is less likely to be the true label for the data point, whereas a low value means that the initial label is more robust. The information entropy of the posterior label distribution can be used to measure general uncertainty of the labels at each data point. In addition, simulating many Monte Carlo trials can be efficiently parallelized because each trial is independent of one another.</p><p>Clustering labels can be extended to a small number of new data points in an online-learning context (Supplementary Fig. 3). As a new data point arrives, we can iteratively check whether label influences from existing clusters can cross the threshold of the new vertex. If multiple label influences from different clusters exceed the threshold, then the new data point takes on the label with the highest average influence. If none of the average label influences can cross the threshold, then the data point becomes the seed vertex for a new cluster. Thus, in contrast to previous online clustering methods, Forest Fire Clustering can discover new clusters in newly arrived data, which reduces the computational cost for re-clustering and scales with the growth of high-throughput technologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluating forest fire clustering on synthetic data</emphasis></p><p>We first examined the performance of Forest Fire Clustering on simulated Gaussian mixtures (Fig. 2a, e). We constructed two Gaussian mixture models (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.15 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.2) with eight distributions located evenly around the unit circle (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 500). Forest Fire Clustering identified a cluster corresponding to each Gaussian in the mixture. As fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> indirectly determines the cluster sizes, Forest Fire Clustering can infer the number of clusters in the data by separating different Gaussians with the sparse regions in between.Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Visualizing the Forest Fire Clustering process with Gaussian mixture models.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Forest Fire Clustering labels on Gaussian mixtures (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.15) centered on the unit circle. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Average heat  during label acceptance plot when <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.15. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Posterior exclusion probability (PEP) of the Forest Fire labels on Gaussian mixtures from part (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Entropy of the Forest Fire labels on Gaussian mixtures from part (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> Forest Fire Clustering labels on Gaussian mixtures (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.20) centered on the unit circle. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> Average heat  during label acceptance plot when <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.20. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis> The number of clusters found in the data decreases as the fire temperature increases. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">h</emphasis> Silhouette score of Forest Fire Clustering vs. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means clustering on Gaussian mixtures from part (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>).</p><p>Interestingly, the number of clusters can also be inferred from the number of peaks in the average label influence plot (Fig. 2b). This plot records the average label influence  of each vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> when it accepts a label, which traces the dynamics of the clustering process and provides a new perspective for interpreting the clustering results. As the cluster size increases, the unlabeled vertices become farther away from the cluster center and experience less average heat. With a low Gaussian variance, every spike corresponds to a meaningful cluster that was discovered. With a higher Gaussian variance, eight clusters were discovered, although two clusters were separated differently from the ground truth (shown in green and orange). Accordingly, the average label influence over time plot indicated different spikes for those clusters (Fig. 2f). Therefore, these plots enhance interpretability and could serve as a heuristic in determining the quality of the clustering results.</p><p>To internally validate the previous clustering results, we constructed posterior label distributions using Monte Carlo simulations, and we computed the posterior exclusion probability and label entropy of each data point in the Gaussian mixtures (Fig. 2c, d). The validation shows higher-label entropies over a particular cluster and between a few clusters. Further, data points on the boundaries of clusters have higher posterior exclusion probabilities, indicating that Forest Fire Clustering is less confident about the labels on those data points. In single-cell analysis, the posterior exclusion probabilities can be used to control the quality of the cell types for each cell.</p><p>In addition to conducting internal validation, we evaluated the quality of the clusters discovered by Forest Fire Clustering. By varying our only effective hyperparameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>, we investigated whether the algorithm could consistently find high-quality clusters. We verified our hypothesis that as the fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> increases, the average cluster size also increases (Fig. 2g). Therefore, the fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> is an intuitive parameter used for generating clusters of different sizes. In addition, we discovered the number of clusters <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> using Forest Fire Clustering and compared with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K-</emphasis>means using the same <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> (Fig. 2h). As the fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> increases, the silhouette score of Forest Fire Clustering converges to that of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means. Since the silhouette score of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K-</emphasis>means is locally optimal given the number of clusters K, this suggests that Forest Fire Clustering can generate approximately optimal clusters with an appropriate fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>. In \u201cMethods\u201d, we further explain the ability for Forest Fire Clustering to generate high-quality clusters without an objective function and demonstrate the asymptotic convergence of Forest Fire clusters to true cluster distributions.</p><p>We performed simulated experiments to examine whether Forest Fire Clustering can infer the emergence of new clusters in out-of-sample data. With only four training clusters (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03c3</emphasis> = 0.1), Forest Fire Clustering demonstrated strong performance as the number of unseen clusters in the out-of-sample data increased, with average ARI and purity score both greater than 0.90 throughout (Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, the out-of-sample cluster discovery remains robust with increasing Gaussian noise. However, Forest Fire Clustering can only guarantee consistently high online-learning performance when there is more training data than test data, because large training datasets create well-defined manifolds that are less impacted by various test data arrival sequences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparing forest fire clustering with other clustering methods</emphasis></p><p>As mentioned previously, Forest Fire Clustering is designed to overcome the weaknesses of many clustering methods on single-cell sequencing datasets (Fig. 3a). When compared with other clustering methods, Forest Fire Clustering can generate clusters with minimal prior assumptions and can compute a non-parametric point-wise posterior probability for internal validation. In addition to these unique advantages, we benchmarked Forest Fire Clustering with many existing clustering methods on a large number of synthetic datasets (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparing Forest Fire Clustering with other clustering methods.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Table comparing features of Forest Fire Clustering with many existing clustering methods. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Benchmarking Forest Fire Clustering with other types of clustering methods on synthetic datasets (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 1000). The lower left denotes the purity score, and lower right records the runtime (green \u22640.1 s; yellow &gt; 0.1 s and \u22641 s; red &gt; 1 s).</p><p>For ring-shaped or half-moon-shaped data (Fig. 3b), distribution-based methods like Gaussian mixture modeling could not accurately categorize these datasets and achieved a relatively low purity score of 0.5 and 0.85, respectively. Both distribution-based and centroid-based methods are limited in identifying non-convex clusters. In contrast, the cluster boundaries from our method are more flexible because label propagation in the data manifold makes minimal assumptions about the shape of the data. Moreover, the results suggest that Forest Fire Clustering can better uncover the number and size of the clusters than connectivity-based methods, especially when the intra-cluster distance is larger than the inter-cluster distance. Similar to the linkage function in hierarchical clustering, Forest Fire Clustering propagates its labels to the closest data points when the fire temperature is above a certain threshold. In essence, both methods cluster by locally linking the closest data points into the same group.</p><p>Our method also maintains robust performance when the clusters overlap, whereas density-based methods like DBSCAN and OPTICS perform poorly in this scenario. In particular, given three overlapping clusters in the data, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis> hyperparameter in DBSCAN and OPTICS must be sufficiently small to discover the three clusters, but a small <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis> hyperparameter reduces the reachability and misclassifies some data points between clusters as singleton clusters (with singleton points in black). In contrast, Forest Fire Clustering can be seen as a continuous version of DBSCAN. The smooth nonlinear Gaussian kernel allows for a more flexible representation of the data manifold and serves as a better alternative than the hard <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis> cutoff. Compared to Spectral Clustering, Forest Fire Clustering can find the number of clusters in the data more accurately. Because label propagation only labels each data point once, Forest Fire Clustering also has a significantly shorter runtime compared to Louvain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluating forest fire clustering on simulated scRNA-seq data</emphasis></p><p>SC3 and Seurat are considered popular and widely used single-cell clustering methods17\u201319. In particular, SC3 performs hierarchical clustering on a consensus matrix constructed by repeated <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means clustering on different partitions of the Laplacian eigenvectors, and Seurat maximizes the modularity in a KNN data graph using Leiden. We compared the performance of Forest Fire Clustering with SC3 and Seurat on simulated scRNA-seq data. Using the Splatter package in R20, we generated two types of simulated data for benchmarking: a mixture of discrete cell populations (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 datasets) and continuous stem cells along paths of differentiation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 datasets).</p><p>For simulated discrete cell types (Fig. 4a), Forest Fire Clustering outperformed SC3 in terms of ARI and purity scores (Wilcoxon signed-rank <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> = 9.5 \u00d7 10\u22127). Forest Fire Clustering also outperformed Seurat in ARI (Wilcoxon signed-rank <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22125) but showed no statistically significant difference in purity score. We observed a similar performance in ARI and purity score for continuous cell types (Fig. 4b). This indicates that both Forest Fire Clustering and Seurat can generate homogenous clusters, yet Forest Fire Clustering is better at correctly discovering the intrinsic number of cell types and subcommunities. Further, Forest Fire Clustering outperformed SC3 and Seurat in runtime with an average of 80 ms compared to 12 min and 1 s, respectively (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Simulated scRNA-seq analysis.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Discrete cell types were simulated with Splatter (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 independent datasets) and used to benchmark SC3, Seurat (Louvain), and Forest Fire Clustering. With five discrete cell types, Forest Fire Clustering outperforms SC3 and Seurat in ARI and SC3 in purity score. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Continuous cell types were simulated with Splatter (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 independent datasets) and used to benchmark SC3, Seurat (Louvain), and Forest Fire Clustering. With four cell developmental paths, Forest Fire Clustering outperforms SC3 and Seurat in ARI and SC3 in purity score. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Forest Fire Clustering outperforms SC3 and Seurat in runtime (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 independent datasets). Data are presented as mean values +/\u2212 2SD. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> For continuous cell paths, a stem cell type differentiates into four cell types. As the pseudo-time step increases, each cell type becomes more specialized. Forest Fire entropy is able to mimic the pseudo-time step along the data manifold. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> Within each cluster, label entropy negatively correlates with pseudotime.</p><p>Moreover, the internal validation reveals that the label entropy of a cell negatively correlates with the pseudo-time steps along the paths of differentiation (Fig. 4d, e). As transition cells differentiate and become more specialized along the developmental trajectories, the identities of the cells also become more well-defined (Fig. 4f). Point-wise label entropy through Forest Fire internal validation can capture the change in the uncertainty of the cell identity: transition cells tend to have high-label entropy while differentiated cells tend to have low label entropy. Therefore, Forest Fire Clustering can highlight transition populations in developmental pseudotime and lend deeper insights into single-cell analyses compared to many existing clustering methods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluating forest fire clustering on PBMC single-cell data</emphasis></p><p>To demonstrate the advantage of Forest Fire Clustering on experimental data, we analyzed single-cell sequencing of around 10,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from two datasets. In the first dataset, PBMCs were sequenced with CITE-seq, which measures single-cell gene expression with cell-surface proteins levels21. We used signature cell-surface proteins to categorize PBMCs into various cell types and clustered each cell based on gene expression. In the second dataset, multiomic sequencing jointly profiled the single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression22. We labeled the cells using PBMC marker genes and clustered each cell based on the ATAC peaks. For benchmarking, the Louvain method is a popular single-cell clustering algorithm that maximizes modularity, and Leiden improves upon Louvain in runtime and finding well-connected communities. PARC is a fast combinatorial graph clustering method that incorporates pruning before applying Leiden23.</p><p>The results suggest that our method can correctly categorize major PBMC cell types (Fig. 5). Clustering quality benchmarks indicate that Forest Fire Clustering can consistently produce clusters with similar ARI and purity scores compared with other state-of-the-art single-cell clustering methods (Fig. 5d, f). In addition, Forest Fire Clustering can discover high-quality clusters at different cluster resolutions and cell population sizes (Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. 7). For online clustering, each cell type was ablated from the training data, and batch effects were corrected using Mutual Nearest Neighbors correction24. Clustering quality metrics suggest robust performance in discovering new cell types in the testing data (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9).Fig. 5</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benchmarking Forest Fire Clustering on PBMC data.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Ground-truth cell-surface antibody labels. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Leiden cluster labels. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Forest Fire clusters with point-wise posterior exclusion probabilities and label entropies from internal validation. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Clustering quality benchmarks using labels generated by cell-surface-protein levels while clustering the gene expression (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 different seeds). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> Sankey diagram of surface-protein labels and Forest Fire clusters on gene expression. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis> Clustering quality benchmarks using labels generated by marker genes while clustering the ATAC peaks (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 different seeds).

By focusing on cells with high-confidence labels (PEP &lt; 0.1), we can improve the cluster ARI by more than 20% compared to existing methods (Fig. 5d, f and Supplementary Fig. 10). When analyzing discrete cell types, our internal validation can robustly discover prototypical cells, which could potentially benefit downstream analyses such as differential expression and cell-to-cell communication network modeling. Similar clustering benchmarks on human cortex scRNA-seq and mouse skin multiomic sequencing further support these conclusions (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).</p><p>In addition, Forest Fire Clustering can analyze continuous cell types. Recapitulating results from our simulation studies, the label entropies decreased as diffusion pseudotime increased within each cell type, and progenitor cells in diffusion pseudotime analysis matched the cells highlighted by Forest Fire label entropy25 (Fig. 5i). However, as a top-down approach, diffusion pseudotime analysis risks making incorrect assumptions about the signature genes expressed in transitional cells, which could lead to the wrong choice of root for diffusion. Instead, Forest Fire Clustering adopts a bottom-up approach by empirically uncovering cells with high differentiation potency along the data manifold. Compared with diffusion pseudotime, our method has the unique advantage of assuming no prior knowledge about transition cells a priori (e.g., signature gene expression)26. By initiating label propagation from various cells in their developmental trajectories, Forest Fire can find transition cell types at the intersections of these label propagations where the label entropy is high. We further demonstrated this capability with scRNA-seq data on mouse hematopoietic stem cells (mHSCs)27 and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) spanning physiological developmental days28 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Therefore, our method can naturally uncover branching points along developmental trajectories and reveal new biological insights from single-cell sequencing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluating forest fire clustering on large-scale mouse single-cell data</emphasis></p><p>As the number of cells sequenced by single-cell technologies grows, the scalability of clustering algorithms becomes increasingly important. Here, we demonstrate the efficiency of Forest Fire Clustering compared with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms on large heterogeneous datasets. Specifically, the Mouse Cell Atlas (MCA) contains gene expression data of around 400,000 cells from various mouse tissue profiled using Microwell-seq29. Compared to other large-scale sequencing datasets, the tissue of origin for cells in MCA can serve as ground-truth labels for comparisons among clustering algorithms.</p><p>The results indicate that Forest Fire Clustering is faster than state-of-the-art single-cell clustering algorithms while generating similar quality clusters (Fig. 6d, e). In addition, Forest Fire Clustering uses less memory compared to existing methods. The runtime and memory usage benchmarks suggest that Forest Fire Clustering can efficiently scale to larger datasets. As expected, benchmarking on 1.3 million mouse brain cells from 10\u00d7 Genomics supported these findings (Supplementary Fig. 14).Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benchmarking Forest Fire Clustering on MCA data.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Forest Fire cluster labels. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Posterior exclusion probability for the Forest Fire cluster labels. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> Entropy for the Forest Fire cluster labels. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis> Clustering runtime and peak memory usage benchmarks (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 different seeds). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis> Clustering quality benchmarks (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 20 different seeds).

For a heterogeneous dataset like MCA, focusing on cells with high-label confidence (PEP &lt; 0.1) improved the ARI from 0.38 to 0.72. In addition, neonatal and fetal mouse tissues exhibit higher-label entropies, supporting our previous conclusion that label entropies mimic developmental time (Fig. 6f). Further, cells with high-label entropies differentially express developmental and cell differentiation marker genes (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). However, computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations are needed to derive these new insights. In practice, we found that a few thousand Monte Carlo trials are enough to obtain reasonable approximations. Moreover, the Monte Carlo simulations are embarrassingly parallel and can be efficiently accelerated using multiprocessing with minimal synchronization overhead (Supplementary Fig. 17).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Currently, there are many open challenges associated with the unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data4,30. First, many clustering methods make strong explicit or implicit prior assumptions about the data. For example, Gaussian mixture models assume that the data are Gaussian distributed. However, previous studies have shown that scRNA-seq data do not follow any known distribution31. Second, existing clustering methods cannot internally validate their clustering results. For rare cell-type discovery in single-cell analysis, it is crucial to cluster with minimal prior assumptions and report the confidence of the labels at each point for validation. Third, while it is known that discrete cell types exist in single-cell data, some cells can be placed in a continuous gradient of two or more end states without clear boundaries4. To tackle these existing challenges associated with clustering high-dimensional single-cell data, a clustering algorithm should be specifically designed to meet single-cell analysis needs.</p><p>Here, we developed Forest Fire Clustering inspired by forest fire dynamics32. By reformulating the label-propagation algorithm to iteratively find clusters in the data manifold, Forest Fire Clustering offers an efficient and intuitive approach to clustering data. With only one effective hyperparameter that indirectly governs cluster size, our method can discover the number of clusters in the data with minimal prior assumptions. Forest Fire Clustering outperforms previous clustering methods on common benchmarks and shows robust performance on scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, Forest Fire Clustering can conduct internal validation using Monte Carlo simulations. Clustered labels are randomly propagated to produce point-wise posterior exclusion probabilities, which can quantify the label confidence of each data point and serve as a metric for quality control. In addition, point-wise label entropies can highlight branching points and key transition cells in developmental pseudotime.</p><p>Further, Forest Fire Clustering can potentially be used as a soft clustering method. In hard clustering, a data point either belongs to completely to a cluster or not at all, while a data point under soft clustering can fall in multiple categories. Similar to soft clustering labels, the posterior label distribution models the probabilities of a data point being in different clusters. Generating soft clusters that correspond to the hard clusters could help analyze cell types without clear cut-offs in the feature space. Since continuous cell groups can exist in single-cell sequencing data, Forest Fire Clustering is a softer alternative than partitioning continuous cell groups into discrete categories.</p><p>Distribution-based clustering algorithms could be used to produce parameterized label posteriors. However, these label posteriors assume that single-cell data are well distributed. In contrast, our non-parametric label posteriors make minimal assumptions about the shape of the data and are more useful for single-cell analysis. Currently, there are two ways to calculate a non-parametric significance value: bootstrap resampling or permutations. Bootstrap resampling methods (from hierarchical clustering) can only calculate a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> value indicating whether a particular cluster is significant with respect to other data points33. Hence, this significance value is tied to a group of points. In order to compute a confidence measure for each data point, we can rely on permutation-based methods. However, to our knowledge, many other clustering methods are generally limited in generating cluster permutations, or variations of a cluster that are equivalent across rounds of clustering. For example, there is no definitive correspondence between two sets of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means clustering results because the cluster labels are mathematically invariant. Forest Fire Clustering establishes an equivalence relationship between cluster permutations. New clusters simulated using the seeds from the original cluster are defined as permutations and variations of the original cluster. Then, we can construct a label posterior by attributing the permuted cluster labels to a data point. More importantly, permutation-based methods do not resample from the data and do not suffer from \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d issues compared to bootstrap resampling methods34.</p><p>Many existing methods mimic diffusion or use Monte Carlo for information processing35,36. Indeed, the label propagation in Forest Fire Clustering represents a simplified version of diffusion and is similar to region-growing algorithms for image processing. However, performing repeated label propagations to determine where labels often overlap is unique to Forest Fire Clustering. Crucially, we seek to model self-organized criticality, a concept from statistical physics that governs forest fires, for data mining. Moreover, our approach avoids expensive matrix operations like eigendecomposition on the graph Laplacian, making our methods more scalable and efficient compared to diffusion-based methods. Further, existing graph-based methods rely on objective functions and iterate over the data multiple times. By propagating labels through the data manifold, Forest Fire Clustering makes only one pass through the data, making our approach faster than current graph-based methods.</p><p>As the dimensionality of the data increases, the distances between data points become more uniform, which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio when distinguishing data points from one another. Similar to other clustering methods, Forest Fire Clustering is also limited by the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, the impact of the high dimensionality of the data can be reflected in the internal validation of Forest Fire Clustering, as homogenous data points tend to have higher-label entropies and posterior exclusion probabilities. Forest Fire Clustering has the advantage of making users aware of the pitfalls in high-dimensional data by providing the validation metrics. In a related way, Forest Fire Clustering is sensitive to high dimensionality because our approach aims to mimic real fire propagation, which is a low-dimensional process. Hence, Forest Fire Clustering should be performed with nonlinear dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE, PHATE) to increase the separation between data points (Supplementary Fig. 15)28,37,38.</p><p>Guided by clustering and internal validation results, Forest Fire Clustering can be used to discover rare cell types and reveal branching points along developmental trajectories in single-cell experiments. A future goal of single-cell sequencing analysis is to construct a cell-to-cell communication network using interactions between different cell types. Our method offers the possibility of generating robust cell-type definitions for network construction and analysis. In addition to single-cell sequencing, our method can be generalized to problems in other domains that involve clustering and evaluating the confidence of the clustered labels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forest-fire clustering</emphasis></p><p>Given a set of data points, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis>1, . . . , <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> each with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis> features arranged in a data matrix , we calculate the distance matrix  containing the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis>2 distance between every pair of data points. However, representing the distance matrix for large datasets (&gt;1 million data points) is computationally expensive. Therefore, we can approximate the distance matrix by using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis>2 distance between the KNNs of each data point. Then, the distances are converted into affinities  using the kernel method. We can use a Gaussian kernel or an adaptive kernel on the KNNs to preserve local distances and encode longer trajectory structures. Similar to preprocessing steps in t-SNE and UMAP, the most suitable kernel bandwidth can be estimated using a binary search on the nearest neighbor distances (e.g., SmoothKNNDist in UMAP). By doing so, a similarity graph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">G</emphasis> = (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">V</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis>) is constructed, with each vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">v</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> representing a data point <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and the corresponding pairwise affinities as edges. The affinity matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis></emphasis> acts as the adjacency matrix for graph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">G</emphasis>. In terms of implementing these preprocessing steps, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">scanpy</emphasis> package in Python has a highly efficient and stable function called \u201csc.pp.neighbors\u201d that implements the approximate KNN search and adaptive kernel transformations39. Hence, we directly use this function in our preprocessing step to obtain the affinity matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis></emphasis> from the data matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">W</emphasis></emphasis>.</p><p>For the label-propagation steps, we iteratively cast a label on a vertex and allow the label to propagate until an equilibrium is reached. If one label cannot propagate to all vertices, the procedure is repeated with different labels until all of the vertices in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">G</emphasis> have been given a label. Each vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> starts without a label, corresponding to the state <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> = 0, and accepts a label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> = <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> during the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation.1<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is the threshold above which a vertex would accept a label from neighboring vertices, and the average label influence  is the average influence from labeled vertices on unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> during the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation (Eq. (4)). These values parameterize the label propagation, similar to how they govern forest fire dynamics. There are many hyperparameters in the preprocessing steps such as the K in KNN as well as other parameters involved in the kernel method. It is possible to pair Forest Fire Clustering with other graph construction techniques for preprocessing. Therefore, the core, iterative component of the algorithm has only one effective hyperparameter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Threshold for accepting neighboring labels</emphasis></p><p>The label acceptance threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is analogous to flashpoints in forest fire dynamics. A tree in a forest would start burning when the heat surrounding it reaches a certain level, which corresponds to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> of a vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> in graph <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">G</emphasis>. In order for label propagation to slowly stop at the cluster edges where the data is sparse, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> should be closely related to the density of the graph. Therefore, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> is defined to be the inverse of the degree of a vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>. As the degree <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> increases, the threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> for accepting a label decreases. Then, label propagation drifts towards regions of high data density when estimating the cluster centers. The threshold is analogous to the activation energy in chemical reactions.2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heat and fire temperature</emphasis></p><p>In a forest fire, heat decays non-linearly with increasing distance and is proportional to the fire temperature. Here, the kernel affinity between two vertices <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> is used to model the nonlinear decay in heat as distance increases, and the user-determined hyperparameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> governs the fire temperature. The pairwise label influence between two vertices <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> during the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation is defined as follows.3</p><p>Centered on an unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, label influence accumulates from vertices with label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> during the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation. Therefore, the average label influence  can be modeled as the average pairwise label influence between the unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and all vertices with label <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>.4</p><p>There are two ways to reach a threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>: by setting a higher fire temperature or by using a kernel with a slower decay (or larger bandwidth). When using adaptive kernels, the kernel bandwidth for each vertex is calculated using the distance from its <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-nearest neighbors. The affinity matrix <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A</emphasis></emphasis> is better approximated by using higher numbers of nearest neighbors <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>. However, we show experimentally that the parameter <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> could only marginally increase the clustering quality after a certain threshold (Supplementary Fig. 18). An effective hyperparameter is a hyperparameter that influences the size and number of the clusters found. Since the choice <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> does not play a big role in clustering after a certain threshold, the fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> is the only effective hyperparameter in our clustering algorithm. The fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> plays an important role in clustering and strongly influences the size and number of the clusters discovered, similar to the resolution parameter in Louvain and Leiden. As fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> increases, labels are more likely to propagate to other vertices, causing Forest Fire Clustering to discover larger clusters. On the contrary, smaller clusters are discovered as the fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> decreases.</p><p>For each unlabeled vertex <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, the clustering algorithm iteratively checks whether the average heat  is higher than the threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and adds the vertex to the cluster <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> if it is. With <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> clusters and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> data points, the algorithm has an approximate worst-case runtime of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">O</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis>2) when every data point is a cluster. The labels propagate until the following condition is met for every unlabeled point <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis> at the end of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation.5</p><p>After the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>th label propagation reaches a stopping point, another unlabeled vertex will be randomly selected as the starting vertex for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> + 1th label propagation. The algorithm continues until all vertices have been labeled, as shown in the pseudo-code of the algorithm below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Algorithm 1</emphasis>: Forest Fire Clustering</p><p>Since Forest Fire Clustering is a randomized algorithm, we can employ the method of conditional probabilities to improve the stability and lower bound the accuracy when choosing random seeds, similar to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means++ initialization. Specifically, in the implementation, the first seed is randomly chosen. Instead of randomly choosing the next seed from the remaining points, the next and subsequent seeds are deterministically chosen as the data point that experiences the lowest heat from the previous cluster. Overall, each seed is still chosen randomly, since the first seed is random. However, subsequent seed selections could be seen as pessimistic estimators of the next cluster center. This optimization significantly reduces the stochasticity and increases the stability of Forest Fire Clustering. At the end, our clusters have the following definition. If <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> is any cluster, then for vertices {\u2200 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>\u2223<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> = <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>} and {\u2200 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis>\u2223<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">j</emphasis> \u2260 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>}:67</p><p>Each propagation is effectively governed by a local energy function at every vertex that dictates whether the vertex is going to be labeled or not (i.e., \u201ccatch on fire or not\u201d). Once the total heat crosses the threshold <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>, it is similar to crossing the activation energy barrier for a chemical reaction, and the heat from the newly labeled vertices (i.e., \u201cnewly burnt tree\u201d) contributes to the overall heat and drives continuous label propagation to nearby vertices. The clustering process repeats until the total heat flow cannot cross new activation energy barriers. At that point, the configuration of labeled (i.e., \u201con fire\u201d) vertices represents a local energy minimum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proving asymptotic convergence of forest fire clustering</emphasis></p><p>In the following section, we show that Forest Fire clusters can asymptotically converge to true cluster distributions up to the second moment.</p><p>Given <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> d\u2212dimensional data points from cluster <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> where  such that \u2223\u2223<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis>1 \u2212 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>\u2223\u22232 &lt; \u2223\u2223<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis>2 \u2212 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>\u2223\u22232 &lt; . . . &lt; \u2223\u2223<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> \u2212 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u03bc</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>\u2223\u22232, Forest Fire Clustering chooses a random point <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">X</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis> with heat modeled by the kernel .

Intuitively, Forest Fire Clustering can be understood as a specific instance of kernel density estimation (KDE) applied to clustering. Even though each Gaussian kernel assumes a certain shape, KDE is still an effective way to nonparametrically estimate the underlying distribution. Similarly, FFC can also non-parametrically approximate the global cluster distribution in the data by applying the kernel to each data point.1314</p><p>Forest Fire Clustering iteratively labels clusters 1. . . <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis>, and data points are added to each cluster in a greedy fashion.

For discrete cell group simulations, five groups were generated (0.45, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1) with parameters (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> = 0.20, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis> = 1.5), and the cells were clustered with fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> = 50 and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = 50. For continuous cell group simulations, four groups were generated (0.35, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15) with parameters (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> = 0.1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">u</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis> = 0.25, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">b</emphasis> = 0.5, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">d</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">f</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">L</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> = 0.2) along the differentiation path (0, 0, 0, 0), and the cells were clustered with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = 50 and fire temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> = 30. For visualizations, Savitzky\u2013Golay filters were used to fit local polynomials and highlight the inverse relationship between developmental pseudotime and label entropy.</p><p>There are three main ways to evaluate the performance of unsupervised methods. First, purity scores evaluate the cluster labels based on a set of reference labels. To calculate the purity score, one can construct a confusion matrix and assign the dominant predicted cluster to each ground-truth cluster. Then, the sum of the total data points in dominant predicted clusters is divided by the total number of data points to compute the purity score. The metric quantifies whether the predicted clusters contain only points from a reference cluster by a value from zero to one. Second, the ARI also measures the similarity between two clusterings. The Rand index quantifies whether all pairs of points in two clusterings match up to the same cluster. The ARI is the Rand index adjusted for the chance. Silhouette scores evaluate the similarity of data points within a cluster compared with the similarity of data points outside of the cluster. Different from the purity score and ARI, the silhouette score does not require ground truths as a reference to compute the statistic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Analysis of experimental data</emphasis></p><p>The RNA gene expression count data for both PBMC datasets were preprocessed using the \u201czheng17\u201d recipe in the scanpy package in Python44. For CITE-seq, cell-surface proteins were used to label PBMC cell types using marker genes available from 10\u00d7 Genomics. The first 30 principal components were used to generate other low-dimensional embeddings (UMAP, t-SNE, Diffusion Maps, PHATE). For graph-based methods (like Louvain, Leiden, and PARC), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = 50 was used to generate a KNN graph from the low-dimensional embeddings. \u00cfn addition, the K-sparse affinity matrix used by Forest Fire Clustering was constructed from the same KNN graph. Hence, clustering was performed on the low-dimensional embeddings with different hyperparameter configurations (with resolution = (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5) for Louvain, Leiden, and PARC, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> = (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) for Forest Fire Clustering).</p><p>The clustering results were evaluated using cell-surface-protein labels. To generate a stronger baseline for benchmarking, the best performance across the hyperparameter configurations and dimensionality reduction methods was used for comparison between clustering methods. Leiden clusters with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Procr</emphasis> marker expression were used as roots for diffusion pseudotime analysis. For multiomic sequencing, cell-type labels were inferred from RNA gene expression count using the pegasus package in Python with the \u201cpg.infer_cell_types\" function and the \u201chuman_immune\" marker gene set45. The ATAC peak counts were log-transformed and standardized, and the top 10,000 highly variable ATAC peaks were selected for PCA. Similarly, the first 30 principal components were used to generate other low-dimensional embeddings (UMAP, t-SNE, Diffusion Maps, PHATE). For graph-based methods (like Louvain, Leiden, and PARC), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = 50 was used to generate a KNN graph from the low-dimensional embeddings. In addition, the K-sparse affinity matrix used by Forest Fire Clustering is constructed from the same KNN graph. In PBMC, our analysis shows that UMAP embeddings obtained the best quality Forest Fire clusters compared to other dimensionality reduction methods (Supplementary Fig. 19). Previous works have also supported UMAP embeddings as effective coordinates for clustering37.</p><p>The gene expression count matrix for MCA was also preprocessed using the \u201czheng17\u201d recipe in the scanpy package but with the top 5000 highly variable genes selected. Similarly, the first 30 principal components were used to generate other low-dimensional embeddings (UMAP, t-SNE, Diffusion Maps, PHATE). For graph-based methods (like Louvain, Leiden, and PARC), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = 50 was used to generate a KNN graph from the low-dimensional embeddings. In addition, the K-sparse affinity matrix used in Forest Fire Clustering is constructed from the same KNN graph. Therefore, clustering was performed on the these low-dimensional embeddings with different hyperparameter configurations (with resolution = (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5) for Louvain, Leiden, and PARC, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis> = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) for for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">K</emphasis>-means, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> = (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) for Forest Fire Clustering). In MCA, t-SNE embeddings (with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">e</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">y</emphasis> = 75) produced better separation between cell types than other methods. Therefore, t-SNE embeddings were used for visualizations. The tissue labels were used as ground truths for benchmarking. Differentially expressed genes were extracted by using scanpy\u2019s \u201crank_genes_groups function\u201d with the Wilcoxon test and Bonferroni corrections. Error bars were generated by repeating each experiment ten times.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online clustering</emphasis></p><p>In certain scenarios, it is more convenient to make inferences on a small number of new data points without re-clustering, especially when the number of data points is initially large (&gt;1 million cells), also known as the \u201cn+1\u201d clustering problem. Therefore, we formulated Forest Fire Clustering to allow for the continuous integration of a few new out-of-sample data points. The dataset previously clustered can be seen as the training data, and the newly arrived data can be viewed as the testing data. The goal of online clustering is to correctly classify the cluster labels in the testing data, which may contain new clusters. Data preprocessing and clustering are first performed on the training data. Then, we independently normalize and log-transform the testing data, as if they arrived at different times. Further, we assume that the training and testing data will share the same set of features. If the features of the training and testing data are disjoint, then it would not be possible to extrapolate clusters from the training data to the testing data. Therefore, we subset the testing data to contain only the top genes from the training data as features, and we correct batch effects between the training and testing data with mutual nearest neighbor batch correction. Then, the testing data are projected onto the low-dimensional representations of the training dataset. A joint affinity matrix of the training and testing data is then calculated from the joint low-dimensional embeddings. After the joint affinity matrix is computed, we then extend the cluster predictions to the testing data.</p><p>For each data point in the testing data, Forest Fire Clustering checks whether the average label influence from the clustered data can cross the threshold of the testing data point. If there are multiple label influences that can cross the threshold, then the testing data point takes on the label with the highest influence. If there are no label influences that can cross the threshold, then the testing data point becomes a seed vertex for a new cluster. Therefore, after seeds for new clusters are selected in the testing data, Forest Fire Clustering propagates the new labels through the testing data manifold, allowing new clusters to be discovered in the testing data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institutes of Health under award numbers K01MH123896, U01DA053628, and UM1DA051410.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Tang, F. mRNA-seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nat.

The decision was based on numerous factors, including the fire's location near the national forest boundary and prioritizing plans for prescribed fire in the nearby Montoya Unit.</p><p>The Medio Fire was caused by lightning and first reported on May 13. The fire crept on the forest floor, consuming fuels like pine needles, brush and fallen branches over a quarter-acre. Crews fully contained it yesterday.</p><p>\"Every fire receives a risk-based strategy,\" said District Ranger Angie Krall. \"When the conditions and circumstances are right, we might use a fire with similar behavior in the future to benefit forest health before containing flames.\"</p><p>Ponderosa pine stands are fire dependent and need it-frequently at low intensities-to maintain ecosystem functions.</p><p>While the Medio Fire is adjacent to the Canjilon Wildland Urban Interface Project area, Krall and fire managers opted to focus on the planned 899-acre Montoya Prescribed Fire (<url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/nmcaf-montoya-prescribed-fire\">https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/nmcaf-montoya-prescribed-fire</url>), which could start as early as Friday, May 17 to the east of Canjilon, N.M.</p><p>To reduce the risk from wildfire, Forest Service staff and partners have invested over $10 million in forest restoration in the area since 2011. Many adjacent private landowners, with the assistance of the state, are contributing by thinning and applying prescribed fire on their own properties.</p><p>The public can receive updates on the Montoya Prescribed Fire on InciWeb (<url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/\">https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/</url>).

The court in Valparaiso ruled the two men, who were arrested Friday, could be held for 180 days while they are investigated. The chief prosecutor in the case, Osvaldo Ossand\u00c3\u00b3n, told journalists that the main suspect is Francisco Mondaca, a 22-year-old volunteer firefighter in Valparaiso who is accused of physically starting the fire. </p><p>He said flares and fireworks were found in Mondaca's vehicle. The other suspect was identified as Franco Pinto, a former employee of the National Forest Corp. He is accused of planning the crime. The regional prosecutor for Valparaiso, Claudia Perivancich, said investigators have evidence the two men agreed \"in advance to carry out conduct of this type when the weather conditions were adequate.\" Prosecutors said that according to Mondaca's testimony, there was an economic motive behind the plot - providing more work in fighting fires. They said they had not ruled out the possibility of more people being involved. The commander of the Valparaiso Fire Department, Vicente Maggiolo, said, \"We are very dismayed by the situation.\" Maggiolo called it an isolated incident and said it should not tarnish the work of the fire department. \"We have been saving lives for more than 170 years,\" he told TVN. Christian Little, executive director of the forestry department, described the detention of a former official as \"a pain\" for the agency. Both the fire department and forestry agency said they would tighten hiring procedures. The megafire began Feb. 2 in the Lago Pe\u00c3\u00b1uelas nature reserve, in the central region of Chile, and for several days burned several communes, including destroying more than 10,000 homes. It is considered Chile's worst tragedy since a magnitude 8.8 earthquake killed more than 500 people on Feb. 27, 2010.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GRNWRE-0000018fbf82dd78a59fffbe81f00000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GRNWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBD-YC81-JBSK-R00J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8322</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greenwire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 28, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news reporting out of Rio Negro, Argentina, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Fire propagation is a big concern all over the world. Visualization is a valuable tool to test possible different scenarios for fire spread, specially for designing strategies for fire control, mitigation and management.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from National University, \"We present a parallel High-Performance Computing (HPC) forest fire simulator with an interactive and intuitive user interface that offers several functionalities to the user. The visualization interface allows to choose the propagation model of preference, the scenario of interest, as well as numerous simulation features including firebreaks and ignition points. We show some of the outputs for two different mathematical models for fire spreading. The simulator was developed with an open source philosophy in the framework of Faster Than Real Time (FTRT) applications thinking on its possible use in the field during a forest fire propagation.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It can be run in Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows Operating Systems and for portability purposes the simulator was also implemented on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Visualization and Modeling of Forest Fire Propagation In Patagonia.

I\u2019m your host, Greg Sargent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u200aWith wildfires raging out of control in Los Angeles, Donald Trump unleashed some truly ugly and hateful attacks on California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. This might seem like Trump being Trump, and a lot of reporters will treat it that way. But we think there\u2019s another way to look at this. It\u2019s yet another example of how the right wing, particularly in the MAGA era, seeks to thoroughly degrade public life in every conceivable way it can and looks for every way it can find to turn Americans against each other at the most critical moments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, we\u2019re super excited to be talking about all this with Nicole Hemmer, who\u2019s one of the best historians of the right wing out there today. She\u2019s the author of a number of books, most recently <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Partisans-Conservative-Revolutionaries-American-Politics/dp/1541646886\">Partisans </url>,</emphasis> which traces today\u2019s moment back to the 1990s. Nicole, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicole Hemmer: </emphasis>Thanks so much for having me, Greg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>The wildfires in California, they\u2019re just a horror. Thousands are fleeing, at least two are dead as of now. But Trump attacked the governor as Gavin \u201cNewscum,\u201d blaming the fires on the incompetence of the Biden-Newscum duo, as he put it. Trump said Biden was leaving him no money in FEMA and blamed the lack of water to fight the fires on California environmental policy, which Newsom\u2019s office immediately shot down as pure fiction.<br/><br/>In fact, Newsom has poured huge amounts of money into firefighting and forest management. What\u2019s your immediate reaction to this from Trump?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It definitely is the case that this is something Trump does, right? He takes these moments, moments that used to be a time when people began to come together a little bit, at least in that period of immediate disaster when there\u2019s shock and horror ... You and I grew up in a period where we had the Oklahoma City bombing, the Columbine shootings, so many different natural disasters. And they have been these moments when people found a kind of common humanity. I don\u2019t want to paint too rosy a picture of it, but I do think that there\u2019s something substantially different about entering that moment and saying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Actually, the person responsible for your problems are my political enemies,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and instead of focusing on rebuilding, you should focus on hating them.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>Yeah. I want to try to understand this as a full-on right-wing MAGA effort to degrade public life. Everything is about seizing on every opportunity to s Spread deranged conspiracy theories, turn people against each other. When the flooding in North Carolina happened during the campaign, for instance, remember Trump and MAGA pushed all kinds of lies about the disaster response. When Trump was president during Covid, he used it to attack blue state governors and blame them.<br/><br/>Can you talk about this impulse as a kind of broader phenomenon of the right wing today?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>You have this desire to metastasize disasters, to make them worse than they actually are. It does strike me as something novel about the right, certainly within the last 15 years. I think it goes back a little bit further because I\u2019m a historian and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to say, but there is something that is a combination of the malignancy of Donald Trump himself, who is constantly seeking ways to be in the headlines, the media environment in which we live that really favors this outrage and negative emotion, and a conservative media ecosystem that takes that revved up let\u2019s-make-everybody-angry dynamic and applies it directly to electoral politics.</p><p>All those things come together in order to turn everything that happens into an opportunity for a fight and into an opportunity to make everyone feel worse than they already felt. And that I think is It gets to the heart of what you\u2019re saying about the degradation of public life, that everything just feels worse all the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You wrote a book about the right wing media, called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Messengers-Right-Conservative-Transformation-American/dp/0812248392\">Messengers of the Right </url>,</emphasis> that gets into the whole history of its evolution, gets at some of its darker impulses over the years. I think you\u2019re getting at something critical here when you say there\u2019s a bit of a different thing going on, and I wonder if technological change is part of it.<br/><br/>Elon Musk is right now fanning the flames of hate around the California stuff. He essentially bought Twitter to elevate and expand and spread deranged right wing conspiracy theories, to make it a space for that. Does that make things worse? Is that something new? Is that part of what we\u2019re seeing now?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It\u2019s like we\u2019ve reached the apotheosis or like the height of all of these different trends with both Donald Trump and Elon Musk. We certainly could go back and we could look at conservative media, which has for decades really been a site of conspiracy theorizing and partisan attacks. That\u2019s not anything that\u2019s new. But its combination with electoral politics is something that really started to come of age in the \u201990s, and then you layer on top of it this not just anger but a kind of meanness that has become the overarching emotional scale or the emotional tenor of right-wing media. It used to be you would have to turn on Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck in order to access that, and now you just have to listen to a Republican politician and you\u2019re going to get uncut, unmediated conspiracy theories and cruelty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>It\u2019s really interesting that you say that, because for a time during the talk radio era, it was a separate space. I can recall a time when older people who were seeking refuge from the modern world would turn on right-wing talk radio, and it seemed like a separate realm. And yet now the idea of a separate realm is gone; it\u2019s all sort of merged together. All these Republican politicians are constantly tweeting out the most sick memes that you can imagine. Has there been an erosion where the private spaces or the separate spaces where this once resided are now gone? It\u2019s all one?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It is all one big mass, and all one big mess. It is an erosion that\u2019s been happening over time.<br/><br/>I really would root this in the 1990s when the lines between politics and entertainment began to erode, and also when Republican politicians really began to take their cues from right-wing media. I think about the suicide events, Vince Foster in 1993, and the conspiracy theories around his suicide, this idea that the Clintons had him murdered.<br/><br/>This was extremely popular in right-wing media, but it very quickly jumps over into Republican politicians. You had one member of Congress, Dan Coats, who talked on the floor about going into his backyard, getting a melon and a handgun and proving, he said, that Vince Foster couldn\u2019t have shot himself, that it had to be a murder. That almost right-wing radio cosplay is happening in the \u201990s. And now we see it not just in a one-off representative from Indiana, but in almost the entirety of the Republican caucus. That\u2019s what feels different: that erosion of any separate sphere for some of the craziness, that it has infected the entire party. It\u2019s also infected all of us.We can\u2019t escape from it either.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>The use of these moments to degrade public life and make people dumber also has a history. You write about Pat Robertson in your book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=partisans+by+nicole+hemmer&amp;hvadid=616116387117&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9007733&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=2275958424626288384&amp;hvtargid=kwd-1727416287532&amp;hydadcr=22566_13531289&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;ref=pd_sl_2ban64dhou_e\">Partisans </url></emphasis>. He seized on natural disasters to cast them as punishment for social liberalism. In a way you can see MAGA\u2019s conduct as an updated, secularized version of this in the sense that disasters are always cast as a failure of Democratic governance. Or in other cases, with Covid\u2019s initial spread in blue cities, it was attacked as a sign that cosmopolitan urban areas are corrupted and infested and diseased.<br/><br/>Is there a through line from that Pat Robertson religious right stuff right through to the way MAGA does it today?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>I think there is. There are two ways that conservatives got to natural disasters as political opportunities. Certainly, it comes up through the religious right.<br/><br/>Pat Robertson is saying that everything, from hurricanes to earthquakes to tornadoes, these are all God\u2019s punishment. And even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina happened, there was a pastor, John Hagee, who said, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Well, have you been to New Orleans? You see the way that they are. You see what sinful people they are.God has sent this as punishment against them</emphasis>. So you have that history and that rhetoric.</p><p>I also think that Hurricane Katrina is a really important moment here because Hurricane Katrina was badly mismanaged by the Bush administration. That was something that benefited Democrats, because Americans hated the way that Bush responded to Katrina, and Republicans took from that. Not that they should be better at responding to natural disasters, but that you could seize on a natural disaster to injure the Democrats.</p><p>When Barack Obama takes office, they first take the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and they try to turn that into Obama\u2019s Katrina.<br/><br/>You have Republican politicians who are, on the one hand, talking to the administration and getting all sorts of help from the administration, and then going on Fox News and talking about how terrible and unresponsive the Obama administration is. You see it in Superstorm Sandy. You\u2019ll remember that Chris Christie was persona non grata for years because he accepted aid from the Obama administration. So I think that\u2019s an important turning point because Republicans realized that they could make political hay from natural disasters.<br/><br/>And then you get to Donald Trump, and he\u2019s like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hey, every time a natural disaster happens, I can make political hay out of it. </emphasis>Whether it is a hurricane in Puerto Rico or fires out in California, what you get is a purely partisan political response to what\u2019s happening. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> There\u2019s another good example of this as well.<br/><br/>Remember when the chemical train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, MAGA figures tried to cast it as proof that liberal elites were deliberately abandoning a virtuous white  working class community. They actually racialized this. JD Vance even did a little bit of that. If you\u2019ll recall on Twitter and in social media, these pictures of these huge clouds rising up out of East Palestine were everywhere, and right-wing politicians were pushing them. They all coalesced behind this story in which the white working class was being abandoned and getting poisoned by liberal elites. I see a lot of that in there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer:</emphasis> Absolutely. This does seem to me to be one of those places where the mode of politics and the media really combine with one another. That East Palestine story was not only the headlining story on all of these right-wing media sites but, of course, it was on social media sites like X and it would combine with all sorts of fake images and fake stories. It all becomes this stew where you might not even really know what happened in East Palestine but you walk away with this feeling that something went horribly wrong, people are very angry about it, and you just feel worse about your country and the people in it when you hear about that story. That brings us back to Donald Trump and the degradation of everything. There\u2019s no space for a story of hope or renewal to emerge. It\u2019s all just awfulness and destruction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>That\u2019s exactly it. The explicit game plan here is to just fill everybody with hate and rage and, critically, confusion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Yeah. Remember Steve Bannon\u2019s saying that the strategy of the Trump administration\u2014he was saying this back in 2015, 2016\u2014was to flood the zone with crap, right?<br/><br/>Just put so much bad stuff out there, make people feel terrible all the time, and while people are feeling terrible, you can go over here and amass all of this political power and use it for whatever you want. And we are still living in that world. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> There\u2019s an irony to this in the current context, by the way. If Trump were president right now, he\u2019d be using the wildfires and he\u2019d be withholding federal help to extort political or even personal favors from Gavin Newsom.<br/><br/>In fact, you may recall that Politico reported that as president, Trump temporarily withheld wildfire aid from California until he established whether the relevant areas had voted for him. And the funny thing about it is that MAGA sees that as a positive thing, and that\u2019s especially getting worse now that Trump keeps doing it over and over, whether he\u2019s politicizing or spreading conspiracy theories around the flooding in North Carolina, or spreading lies about California. He\u2019s just telling his supporters, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This is what we should be doing, we should take every opportunity to try to grind blue America and non-MAGA America into the dirt.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It is absolutely his strategy. He did it with the ventilators too, during the early days of Covid. And it really is not just about negotiation and power plays, although that\u2019s how it\u2019s often framed in Trumpworld\u2014he\u2019s a master negotiator, he\u2019s getting these people to bend to his will. It\u2019s actually this deeper fascistic strategy of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem.\u201d  And what do you do with \u201cthem\u201d? You punish them at every opportunity. If you have power, you use that power to protect your own and to harm others. And that is absolutely the philosophy of the Trump administration that just becomes very clear in these moments of crisis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You could argue in a way that these types of natural disasters are a real threat to the MAGA project because they actually encourage people to unite and come together and to start to believe that government is there to help them.<br/><br/>This is really anathema. To go all Carl Schmitt on you, MAGA requires politics always to be about the enemy, and there can be no point at which politics is not about the enemy. That, I think, is what explains a lot of this. Can you talk about that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Absolutely. That is the ethos behind MAGA. You have to have somebody who you\u2019re fighting against, somebody who you\u2019re railing against. Moments like in the face of disaster, I was mentioning earlier Oklahoma City and Columbine, 9/11 ... Glenn Beck used to have something called the 9/12 Project, and it was tethered exactly to this idea that in this moment after national tragedy, what happens? We put aside our differences, we come together, we recognize our common humanity, and we want to get back to that kind of feeling.<br/><br/>And that is a danger to a divisive movement. People look at one another and they see that they\u2019re not actually all that different, that they are devoted to a common project. That common project could just be keeping their communities safe and whole, and making sure people have a place to sleep and that they\u2019re safe from the storm\u2014and that is probably the biggest threat to the MAGA project. It\u2019s why these moments have to be turned into moments of division.</p><p>The same thing is true for the right in a way that kind of predates Donald Trump. The big problem of Katrina was not just that it hurt the Bush administration, but it proved the lie of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the most dangerous words in the English language are I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.</emphasis> What did people want? They wanted the government to show up. The government was doing good things. That, too, is a dangerous message.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>That happened in North Carolina too. Republicans had to step forward and say,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> I\u2019m sorry, MAGA, but the truth is that the federal response is actually very good.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer:</emphasis> Right.<br/><br/>Then instead, you also have these stories then of people who could really use the help of the federal government not wanting to interact with FEMA, or waving their guns when FEMA shows up. In these moments of real crisis, it cuts people off from the things that would make their lives better.<br/><br/>That is both part of the MAGA project and part of the conservative project: to take away from people the things that might make their lives better. That seems like it should be easier to counter, but those affective ties that MAGA voters have to Donald Trump are proving to be very difficult to overcome.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent:</emphasis> So Nicole, what\u2019s the answer to this stuff? It seems to me that for MAGA and for MAGA media, a lot of this stuff festers and doesn\u2019t really penetrate to the broader culture really.<br/><br/>But at the same time, as you point out, in some cases it does where some people were duped by the attacks on the federal responders during North Carolina, and that was a terrible thing. Is the answer for Democrats and liberals and small-d democrats and people who want a sane public life to just marginalize and ignore that stuff and count on common humanity to assert itself?<br/><br/>Or is that not enough? Do we have to call this stuff out for the derangement that it really is?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>It seems like hoping that it goes away is not working, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend that as a strategy going forward. I do think that there is real value in calling it out, right? Talking about the fact that it is weird and cruel to respond to a forest fire or to flooding or to a hurricane with this vitriol and these wild conspiracy theories. There is real value in that, and so I definitely think that people should be doing that.</p><p>That can\u2019t be all people do. The other thing that people have to do is model the world that they want to be part of.<br/><br/>It means being the person who shows up for your neighbors. It means being the person who helps gather supplies to send people who are hurt. It means modeling a humane response to disasters when they happen. And so I think that it\u2019s both end. It is both pointing out and making clear how terrible this is, and then proving that there\u2019s a better way to do it right, a better way to move forward. You can\u2019t do that everywhere all the time, but it is something that I would hope that all of your listeners are thinking about: how they can in their communities respond to pain and loss and crisis and deprivation in ways that make their communities better. I actually think that is the generational road out of a lot of this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>Nicole Hemmer, that was beautifully said, and I really hope you\u2019re right that that\u2019s where the true impulse of the American public lies.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for coming on with us today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hemmer: </emphasis>Thank you so much for having me, Greg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sargent: </emphasis>You\u2019ve been listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Blast</emphasis> with me, your host, Greg Sargent. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Daily Blast</emphasis> is a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New Republic </emphasis>podcast and is produced by Riley Fessler and the DSR Network.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWRPON-httpsnewrepubliccomarticle190034transcripttrumpsuglyeruptionswildfireshintdarkerstory</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWRPON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVM-28M3-RS5K-33MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">485137</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3071\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The New Republic, LLC  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Republic (Online)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51341\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 9, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States, United Kingdom &amp;

LaTourette Give Update on New Jersey's Record-Breaking Dry Spell and Wildfire Response</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As New Jersey continues to experience historically low precipitation, above-average temperatures, and deteriorating water-supply conditions, Governor Phil Murphy and DEP Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette announced the State is declaring a Drought Warning and gave an update on the significant increase in wildfires over last year. As New Jersey enters the next stage in severity of water-storage conditions, officials strongly encouraged the public to reduce water use during a virtual press conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters across New Jersey are battling a number of wildfires during a record-breaking dry spell that is affecting the entire Northeast. Since early October, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has responded to 537 wildfires, a more than 1,300% increase in wildfires over the same period last year. The New Jersey Office of Emergency Management has deployed the State's All-Hazards Incident Management Team to supplement operations. The Jennings Creek wildfire, burning along New Jerseys border with New York, claimed the life of New York State parks system employee Dariel Vasquez as he fought the fire on Saturday.</p><p>Since the start of the year, nearly 1,300 wildfires have burned over 11,000 acres. The average number of fires per year since the year 2000 is 1,071 wildfires and 4,000 acres burned.As a result of the extremely dry conditions, mandatory statewide Stage 3 fire restrictions remain in effect. These restrictions prohibit all fires unless they are contained in an elevated stove using only propane, natural gas, or electricity. No wood or charcoal fires are allowed, and the use of kerosene or gas torches of any kind is prohibited while this level of restriction is in place.</p><p>Commissioner LaTourette signed an Administrative Order authorizing the Drought Warning designation, which is the next stage of drought after a Water Supply Drought Watch. DEP announced Drought Watch status in mid-October, following a period of prolonged dry conditions. A Drought Warning enables the DEP to more closely manage water systems by directing water transfers among systems, controlling releases from reservoirs, and modifying the rate of flow in streams and rivers in order to balance ecological protection and needs of water suppliers.</p><p>New Jersey is experiencing unprecedented weather conditionsas a result of climate changethat require us to take these precautionary measures now,Governor Murphy said.It can be challenging to adjust our daily habits, but it is imperative that we all work together, heed the guidance to conserve water, and use the utmost caution outdoors to reduce the risk of wildfire as dry conditions continue statewide.</p><p>Climate change is driving our record low precipitation and above-average temperature recorded statewide in September and October,Commissioner LaTourette said.This combination of events has resulted in decreased streamflow and groundwater levels, which harms our available water supplies. Taking these measures now and encouraging reduced water use will help provide some measure of protection from the weather uncertainty we face entering winter.</p><p>READ MORE</p><p>Statement from Governor Murphy Opposing New York's Congestion Pricing Plan</p><p>Following the relaunch of New York's congestion pricing plan, Governor Murphy released the following statement:</p><p>I am firmly opposed to any attempt to force through a congestion pricing proposal in the final months of the Biden Administration. All of us need to listen to the message that voters across America sent last Tuesday, which is that the vast majority of Americans are experiencing severe economic strains and still feeling the effects of inflation. There could not be a worse time to impose a new $9 toll on individuals who are traveling into downtown Manhattan for work, school, or leisure.</p><p>New Jersey has never been meaningfully consulted on the design of this plan, either in its initial iteration or the version that was announced. Perhaps that is because this effort has always simply been a way to take money from the pockets of New Jersey residents to bail out the MTA from a mountain of debt.</p><p>I have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not put unfair burdens upon hardworking New Jersey commuters. Todays plan woefully fails that test.</p><p>I urge Governor Hochul to reconsider the plan, and I urge all elected officials in the region including those set to take office in January to speak out against this proposal. Meanwhile, my administration will continue the fight to block this plan in court.</p><p>READ MORE</p><p>Acting Governor Tahesha Way Announces Launch of Bringing Veterans Home Initiative</p><p>Acting Governor Tahesha Way announced the launch of Bringing Veterans Home (BVH), an initiative led by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA). Acting Governor Way made the announcement during the State Veterans Day Ceremony at the New JerseyVietnam Veterans Memorial and Museum in Holmdel.</p><p>More than $30 million in State and federal funds has been committed to fund services and interventions over a two-year period to help place more than 1,000 homeless veterans in New Jersey in stable housing. This is the first time veteran service organizations in New Jersey will formally partner with the State in the fight against unsheltered veteran homelessness. This effort will be led by DCAs Office of Homelessness Prevention via a dedicated data and project management team in partnership with DMAVA.</p><p>We must always take the time to express our gratitude and honor the bravery and selflessness of our veterans,said Acting Governor Way.The courageous men and women who have served our country should never bear the weight of homelessness. Our Administration is committed to connecting veterans with the resources they need for the housing they deserve.</p><p>New Jersey veterans deserve our utmost respect and supportafter serving our country, they should never worry about where they will sleep at night,said Governor Phil Murphy.My Administration is proud to partner with our veteran service organizations to invest in the fight against veteran homelessness and ensure that it will be rare and brief in New Jersey.</p><p>READ MORE</p><p>Statement from Governor Murphy on $300 Million in Federal Funding for Improvements to NJ TRANSIT</p><p>Following the announcement of $300 million in federal funding for NJ TRANSIT, Governor Murphy released the following statement:</p><p>This $300 million in grant funding from theFederal Railroad Administrationwill bring needed enhancements to Amtraks infrastructure, which will improve reliability for NJ TRANSIT riders and will also be transformational for Penn Station, which is the gateway between New Jersey and New York.</p><p>Since I took office, I have been committed to improving NJ TRANSIT. But state investments alone are insufficient, as we rely on tracks shared with Amtrak.</p><p>Im proud to announce that this funding will help us improve resiliency along the most heavily traveled rail line in the countryallowing for upgrades that will increase the speed and the volume of trains and improve infrastructure that is more than a century old, including the catenary overhead wire systems that are prone to failures.</p><p>Thank you to the Biden Administration and New Jerseys congressional delegation for working alongside us to secure this funding.</p><p>READ MORE</p><p>Governor Murphy, Governor Hochul, and Port Authority Propose Reduced Fare Program For Passengers With Disabilities on Path Commuter Rail</p><p>Governor Phil Murphy, Governor Kathy Hochul, and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the proposal of a new reduced fare program for customers with disabilities using the PATH system. The 50 percent fare reduction would match the reduced fare program currently available for senior riders. If approved, riders could begin applying for the program in spring 2025, with the reduced fare implemented in the summer as PATH continues rolling out its TAPP tap-to-pay system.</p><p>In New Jersey, we have pursued a whole-of-government approach to empowering residents with disabilities, and we have witnessed how targeted services and supports can help an individual to thrive in their community,said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy.Public transportation is crucial to our disability community enabling countless individuals who may not be able to operate a vehicle to get to work, school, health care appointments, social services, and social gatherings. Todays proposed PATH fare reduction would build on our work to ensure our public transportation infrastructure is inclusive and reliable for all commuters.</p><p>Easy access to convenient, reliable and affordable public transportation is a basic right that everyone should be able to enjoy,said New York Governor Kathy Hochul.With this new fare reduction for people with disabilities proposed by New Jersey Governor Murphy, the Port Authority and myself, Im confident we are making that right to transportation even easier to enjoy.</p><p>The proposed reduced fare program is another step in the Port Authoritys agenda to continue improving the PATH system. Those efforts have included thePATH Improvement Plan, which aimed to increase the systems capacity and reduce delays through new railcars, signal upgrades and track work. PATH riders have also enthusiastically taken to the newTAPP fare payment system, providing a seamless payment option with the tap of a contactless debit/credit card, smartphone or wearable device. Comprehensive work is also ongoing around the $430 millionPATH Forwardprogram, which focuses on improving the speed, reliability and passenger experience on the system.</p><p>READ MORE</p><p>Governor Phil Murphy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126836560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJR-S4M1-JCBF-S0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 15, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The objective of this study was to use satellite imagery and Geographic Information System techniques to assess the forest fire risk zonation map of the Aalital rural municipality.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include #. <br/> Our news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Tribhuvan University: \"This rural municipality is a part of the Sudurpaschim province, Nepal; is prone to forest fires. Four fire risk zones were established in the study area i.e. very high, high, medium, and low-risk zone. Thematic layers were derived from topographic maps and satellite imageries. For the delineation of fire risk zones, a multi-parametric weighted index model i.e. the FRI (Fire Risk Index) method was adopted. The fire incidence data provided by MODIS were used to validate the resulting forest fire risk zone map. About 25.17% of the total study area lies under the very high-risk zone followed by 46.51% under high risk, 25.68% under medium risk, and 2.62% under the low-risk zone.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"It can be inferred that the majority of the area is at high risk of forest fire. This map of fire risk zone can help in disaster and forest management as valuable data to prepare effective measures for appropriate fire risk management in the area.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Forest Fire Risk Zone Mapping of Aalital Rural Municipality, Dadeldhura District, Nepal.

This funding is now beginning to flow into Alaska, benefitting our homes and communities in myriad ways. With numerous new tax credit programs, financing tools, and grant funding opportunities, the IRA has created so many funding opportunities that people are beginning to take advantage of all across our great state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alaskans are starting to benefit from the IRA through a wide variety of programs, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ahfc.us/efficiency/programs-for-homeowners/alaska-residential-energy-rebates\">rebates on new efficient appliances such as stoves, dryers, heat pumps and water heaters</url>; tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements; and expanded tax benefits for installing renewable energy and battery energy storage on homes. These new programs help keep money in Alaskans  pockets, encourage job creation and investment in our homes and businesses, and help reduce energy costs. These direct energy and financial improvements for individuals will be even more important to help mitigate the negative impacts of escalating energy costs on the Railbelt due to the natural gas crisis in Cook Inlet.</p><p>Beyond the individual tax credits, the IRA has also established <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/directpay/\">Direct Pay,</url> a system for non-taxpaying organizations such as nonprofits, Tribes, local governments and utility cooperatives to benefit from these clean energy tax incentives for the first time. By enabling creative financing options like this, we are starting to see movement toward clean energy across sectors.</p><p>New financing and grant opportunities have also been secured for Alaskans, with many millions more to come. The Alaska Energy Authority and Tanana Chiefs Conference and their partners Alaska Housing Finance Corporation and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium together <url normalizedValue=\"https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/alaska-projects-win-nearly-125-million-in-epas-national-solar-for-all-grant-competition/\">received more than $120 million from the IRA s Solar for All Program,</url> which will support rooftop solar, community solar programs and utility-scale solar for communities all around Alaska primarily benefiting low-income residents and Tribes over the next five years. Golden Valley Electric Association received $100 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gvea.com/pace/\">million</url> from the IRA s Powering Affordable Clean Energy to develop grid infrastructure that will improve reliability and enable the development of large-scale solar in Nenana. Southeast Conference <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seconference.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CPRG-NEWS-RELEASE-v4.pdf\">received nearly $40 million from the IRA s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program</url> to install thousands of residential heat pumps all over southeast Alaska to reduce energy use and heating costs for residents. These infrastructure projects will reduce energy costs, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and help to improve the resilience of our electrical systems across Alaska. That s to say nothing of IRA investments in fisheries research and protection, forest fire mitigation programs, transportation infrastructure and much more.</p><p>Alaskans are excited to see the investments of the IRA propel Alaska s transition towards more sustainable, local and clean energy. We look forward to communities and families around the state fully leveraging the IRA. We are thankful to the federal and state agencies working to implement these programs correctly, and to the elected officials, like Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Rep. Mary Peltola, who continue to support these smart investments that build the framework for growing our state s clean energy economy, fighting the impacts of a changing climate, and building a brighter, more resilient future for us all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gavin Dixon</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Griffin Plush</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">volunteer together as board members of The Alaska Center; they are both lifelong Alaskans who work professionally with energy projects across the state.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The views expressed here are the writer s and are not necessarily endorsed by the Anchorage Daily News, which welcomes a broad range of viewpoints.

According to news reporting originating from the Universitas Halu Oleo by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Forest fires are one of the environmental problems that recur almost every year in Indonesia.\"</p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Universitas Halu Oleo: \"This problem if not handled properly will certainly cause various negative impacts such as the emergence of haze that can interfere with public health and reduced forest cover, in forest areas. Taman Hutan Raya Nipa-Nipa (Tahura) as one of the Natural Preservation areas of Southeast Sulawesi Province is also inseparable from the problem of forest fires. The aims of the study were to analyze the level of forest fire vulnerability in the Tahura Nipa-Nipa area, especially in Watu-Watu Village, West Kendari Subdistrict, and the variables that most affect the level of forest fire vulnerability. Data analysis based on the weighting of each element is then carried out the determination of the vulnerability class using equations: forest fire vulnerability = {30 % x (land cover)} + {(20 % x height of place)} + {(20 % x Rainfall)} + {(10 % x distance from road)} + {(10 % x distance from river)} + {(10 % x distance from settlement)}. Mapping the class of forest fire vulnerability areas using geoprocessing with input data on land cover, place height, rainfall, and distance from roads, rivers, and settlements. Then an analysis is carried out and will be selected data according to the score of the level of forest fire vulnerability, namely very low/not a vulnerability with a score of 5, low with a score of 4, medium with a score of 3, high with a score of 2, very high /very vulnerability with a score of 1.\"<br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The results showed that the level of forest fire vulnerability in Tahura Nipa-Nipa has 3 levels, namely the level of high forest fire vulnerability with an area of 68.51 ha, the level of moderate forest fire vulnerability with an area of 62.29 ha, and the level of low fire vulnerability with an area of 143.35 ha. The variables that most affect the level of forest fire vulnerability at the research site are land cover and community accessibility distance in the form of distance from the road and distance from the settlement.\"<br/> For more information on this research see: The Analyses of Forest Fire Vulnerability at Taman Hutan Raya (Tahura) Nipa-Nipa Kendari City. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jurnal Wasian</emphasis>, 2022,9(1):13-29.

According to news reporting from Hefei, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Control of forest fire ignition sources is the top priority in fire management practices.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include Key Science And Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong Province, China. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Science and Technology of China: \"China has gained great success in reducing forest fires in recent years, and the relevant safety measures taken during this process are worthy of investigation and publicity. Based on fire statistical data through the years between 2003 and 2017, we analyzed the detailed classification of fire ignition sources and their contribution to the annual forest fire occurrence. The role of different ignition sources in altering fire occurrence was quantified and ranked by defining a contribution extent parameter. A statistical tool was also applied to conduct correlation analysis to identify variation patterns of time series data from individual fire causes. The annual fire numbers declined after 2008 and stabilized at a level &lt; 2000 in recent years, pointing to the containment of several major ignition sources. Starting from the legislative development, an accountability system was established at all levels from administrative heads to local residents, paving the way for the multifaceted and full-coverage fire prevention publicity and education as well as the fire use restriction in particular seasons.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"The effectiveness of management measures in lessening forest fire occurrence was interpreted using the results of correlation analysis among the fire numbers initiated by individual ignition sources.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Effectiveness in Mitigating Forest Fire Ignition Sources: A Statistical Study Based on Fire Occurrence Data in China.

According to news reporting from Kunming, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Forest fire is an ecosystem regulating factor and affects the stability, renewal, and succession of forest ecosystems. However, uncontrolled forest fires can be harmful to the forest ecosystem and to the public at large.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Southwest Forestry University: \"Although Yunnan, China is regarded as a global hotspot for forest fires, a general lack of understanding prevails there regarding the mechanisms and interactions that cause forest fires. A logistic regression model based on fire points in Yunnan detected by satellite in 2005-2019 was used to estimate how environmental factors in local areas affect forest fire events. The results show that meteorology is the dominant cause of the frequent forest fires in the area. Other factors of secondary importance are the daily minimum relative humidity and the daily maximum temperature. When using the logistic regression model based on the data of fire points in Yunnan over the period 2005-2019, the key threshold for the daily minimum relative humidity is 28.07% \u00b1 11.85% and the daily maximum temperature is 21.23 \u00b1 11.15 \u00b0C for a forest fire probability of 50%. In annual and monthly dynamic trends, the daily minimum relative humidity also plays a dominant role in which combustible substance load remains relatively stable from January to March, and the impact on forest fire becomes greater in April, May, and June, which plays a secondary role compared with the interannual climate. The maximum daily temperature ranks third in importance for forest fires. At the county level, minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature are the top two factors influencing forest fires, respectively. Meanwhile, the differences in forest fire points between counties correspond to the pathways of the two monsoons.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study applies quantitative expressions to reveal the important environmental factors and mechanisms that cause forest fires. The results provide a reference for monitoring and predicting forest fires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: How Environmental Factors Affect Forest Fire Occurrence in Yunnan Forest Region.

That already exceeds last year's total of 501 and far outpaces the totals of 360 in 2022 and 457 in 2021. </p><p>The region isn't alone, as a rash of wildfires has struck the Northeast U.S. over the past several days, according to the Associated Press, including a blaze in New York and New Jersey that killed a parks employee over the weekend. The employee of the New York State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Department who was assisting firefighting crews died Saturday when he was hit by a falling tree. </p><p>The East Coast fires were burning as much larger wildfires raged in California. </p><p>There have been multiple brush fires in the region, including one earlier this year near McCune Road in South Huntingdon that grew to nearly 5 acres before being knocked down. </p><p>\"Our department has an advantage because we have 20 members who are trained in (Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) forestry, including two wardens,\" said Dan Pergola, chief at Turkeytown VFD, the lead company at the South Huntingdon fire. \"For the most part, we didn't use water, we used our sawyers and hand crews.\" </p><p>A sawyer is a firefighter trained to cut down specific trees during a brush or woodland fire. </p><p>Back-to-back mild winters could make the 2024 brush fire season more intense, but the area's fire chiefs say they are prepared. </p><p>\"Normally, our brush fire season goes from late May until about November, depending on temperature and how dry the leaves are,\" said Lower Burrell VFC No. 3 Chief Brennan Sites. </p><p>Westmoreland County Public Safety Director Roland \"Buddy\" Mertz said the most recent state report on weather conditions puts the county at a low risk for brush fires. </p><p>\"I think the steady rain we got over the weekend helped some with lowering that risk,\" Mertz said. </p><p>Before the rain on Sunday, Tarentum's Summit Hose Co. and neighboring companies fought a 15-acre fire over the weekend in the borough's Fourth Ward, said Josh Fox, Summit Hose Co. fire chief. The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Allegheny County fire marshal, Fox said. </p><p>\"It was pretty remote,\" Fox said. </p><p>The brush fire was hard to fight because it was in a wooded area that was not easily accessible. But the Rachel Carson Trail and West Penn Power line paths and a gas line cut through the woods, allowing firefighters to get some ATVs to the site of the fire, Fox said. </p><p>Firefighters hooked a truck to a hydrant and filled a water supply container to feed the smaller brush trucks that maneuvered through the woods. </p><p>In some areas, firefighters had to down trees and dig fire breaks in the woods using a rake and a shovel, Fox said. </p><p>A red flag </p><p>Brian Vinski, who spent nearly three decades as the forest fire specialist supervisor at Forbes State Forest, said he became more concerned as the winter of 2023 progressed and continued with mild weather. </p><p>\"We had very little snow pack, very mild conditions, and even in January (2023) we were seeing field fires popping up across our counties,\" said Vinski, who recently retired. \"That was a red flag for us.\" </p><p>The cause of most brush fires is somewhat predictable. That stands in stark opposition to the fires themselves, which can change direction with the wind. </p><p>\"Someone could take all the right precautions and actions, and if the wind conditions are wrong, it can escape quickly,\" Vinski said. </p><p>Today, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry's forest assistant manager, Cory Wentzel, works with a staff of about 40 people to cover six counties and 60,000 acres of state forest, where they are responsible for wildfire suppression and investigation. </p><p>\"Since July 1, we've responded or sent a fire warden to 71 wildfires covering about 165 acres,\" Wentzel said. </p><p>By comparison, those crews responded to 44 fires covering 25 acres in 2023, and 43 fires covering 101 acres in 2022. </p><p>\"This fall isn't even over, and we're already up to 71,\" he said. \"I've been here for 27 years, and this is the first year I can recall multiple counties enacting temporary burn bans.\" </p><p>As of Tuesday, 17 Pennsylvania counties have instituted 30-day burn bans until late November or early December. Fayette and Somerset counties have put temporary burn bans in effect for residents, as have some local communities in Westmoreland. </p><p>For wildfire experts like Wentzel and Vinski, it's all about humidity and wind speed. </p><p>\"Those are two large factors,\" Vinski said. \"There's also the fuel type where ignition happens. If you have ignition in a field that's 100 acres of grass, with some wind behind it? That rate of spread is going to be very rapid.\" </p><p>By contrast, an ignition among larger fuel -- such as trees and large downed branches -- typically is countered with much more moisture. </p><p>\"The ignition temperature has to be a lot higher, and that fire is not going to spread as quickly,\" Vinski said. </p><p>Carelessness cited </p><p>In Westmoreland County, a large number of brush fires can be traced back to careless acts, whether it's a controlled burn that got away from a property owner or a burning cigarette tossed out a window near a dry woodline. </p><p>Not every report of a brush fire is accurate -- often a fire company will be called out, only to be called off a few minutes later when it's discovered that a homeowner is simply using a burn barrel or getting rid of raked autumn leaves. </p><p>But controlled fires can turn into something more hazardous quite quickly. </p><p>\"All it takes is a little breeze,\" said Crabtree VFD Chief Bill Watkins. \"The majority we see is outdoor burning, whether it's yard waste, garbage or a recreational fire. What we've seen is that a lot of people think the fire's out -- they dump a little water on it and leave -- but unless you stir it up and douse it, it's going to char back up.\" </p><p>Watkins said his department was busy last spring with several brush fires, which he mostly attributed to the mild winter. </p><p>\"A lot of what we see is cigarettes flicked into mulch,\" said Logans Ferry Heights Fire Chief Stephen Marsh of Plum. \"A lot of landscaping and roadway material can ignite. We had one once in the summer where a semi-trailer's brakes were malfunctioning and throwing sparks, and it was dry enough that it ignited a brush fire.\" </p><p>In Allegheny County, West Deer VFC No. 3 Fire Chief Josh Wiegand doesn't see a lot of burn-related brush fires because of the county's stricter burn laws. His department's brush fire calls generally come as a result of downed power lines. </p><p>Special equipment </p><p>Many departments have specialized trucks that are better equipped to access the places brush fires can spread. </p><p>Lower Burrell VFC No. 3 outfitted one of its vehicles with a 300-gallon pump and 1,000 feet of forestry hose. </p><p>\"That allows us to get into places we can't reach with the fire engine,\" Sites said. Lower Burrell's hilly topography and sizable wooded acreage make it susceptible to brush fires in dry conditions. </p><p>\"Once it gets started, it can take off,\" Sites said. </p><p>Bradenville VFD No. 1 in Derry Township has a brush truck and a four-wheel-drive \"attack\" truck along with a utility terrain vehicle that holds 80 gallons of water. </p><p>\"We also use the county's ATV team, which is specialized with tanks on their vehicles and training through the forestry department,\" Bradenville Chief Mark Piantine said. </p><p>Youngwood Fire Chief Lloyd Crago said one of the most effective tools is a simple fire rake. </p><p>\"Those are really the best way to knock them down,\" he said. \"We use those to create a line break to stop the fire, in combination with our booster tanks. Fighting brush fires in the woods, or even along the fields and highways, definitely takes a physical toll on everyone.\" </p><p>Rough-terrain volunteers </p><p>Formed in 1999, the Westmoreland County Team 211 Rough Terrain Support Unit has about 40 member-owned all-terrain vehicles and other equipment it uses to respond to brush fires and search details in locations that firefighters on foot or in larger vehicles can't easily reach. </p><p>\"We don't get called to small brush fires,\" said Jason Frazier, chief of the all-volunteer unit of more than 50 members. \"We get called to the ones you can't walk, climb or get a fire truck to.

According to news originating from National University of Misiones by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This article presents a novel approach to wildfire risk assessment and behaviour prediction by leveraging open geospatial data and ontologies. The proposed methodology includes a spatially weighted index model and multicriteria analysis to represent the risk of forest fires in the affected area.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from National University of Misiones: \"It bridges gaps in theory and practice, offering a comprehensive solution for evaluating potential forest fire risk in near real time, predicting fire behaviour and elucidating the semantics of fire management. During dry and hot conditions, forest fires tend to escalate. Hence, we propose an algorithm that combines experts' empirical criteria and open-source data to identify dangerous fires in near real time, aiding authorities in directing attention to the riskiest areas. The objective is to predict forest fire behaviour, a complex and nonlinear system influenced by dynamic factors such as weather conditions, topography and land use. Our methodology enables real-time assessment of potential forest fire risks, complemented by predictive fire behaviour scenarios and a descriptive ontology of fire management semantics. We examine existing fire-related ontologies and propose a comprehensive one encompassing incident descriptions, firefighting resources, actor interrelations and knowledge for effective action. By classifying fire sources, our algorithm enables strategic decision-making to prevent uncontrolled fires. This solution significantly enhances data using semantic and spatial relationships among wildfire resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate how ontologies improve data integration and interoperability among diverse systems and organisations involved in forest fire risk management, fostering better coordination and faster responses to critical situations. To facilitate decision-making, we create decision-making scenarios linked to analysed hot spots, drawing from open hot spot data such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), OpenStreetMap (OSM), OpenWeatherMap (OWM) and OpenTopoData (OTD). We propose an ordinal and linguistic classification system (F1-F5) denoting risk levels as low, moderate, high, very high and extreme.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"These values are obtained through factor aggregation and fuzzy logic. A publicly accessible, interactive web map displays the results derived from this model. Overall, our contributions to wildfire risk management provide authorities with a valuable tool to make informed decisions and mitigate the damaging effects of wildfires.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Wildfire risk weighting and behaviour prediction using open geospatial data and ontologies.

The overall death toll has risen to 10 and authorities are warning the total may grow. Officials expanded evacuation orders on Thursday after a new fire broke out near the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now California's governor says he's sending 900 more firefighters to battle the new fire. Officials say intensifying winds and dry conditions will continue to complicate firefighting efforts into next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is facing criticism for being out of town when the flames erupted and over budget cuts that affected the city's fire department months ago.</p><p>Here's how she responded on Thursday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAREN BASS, (D) LOS ANGELES MAYOR: These fires are burning now. Our job is to make sure that people stay alive, that we save lives, that we save homes, that we save property. And I also said that when the fires are out, we will do a deep dive. We will look at what worked. We will look at what didn't work. And we will let you know.</p><p>Until then, my focus is on the TV screens behind you that are showing devastation that has continued. Thank you.</p><p>Answered it in the morning. Answered it now. Won't answer it again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FOSTER: CNN's Nick Watt gives us a closer look at the devastation across Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, there's the red plane swooping in to save us. NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sadly, a little too late for this fleeing family. This morning, we found what's left of their home. Nothing.</p><p>Thousands of homes have been lost across the county, plus businesses and more. Fifty billion dollars worth of damage. But the winds finally eased, so now they can attack these flames from the air.</p><p>All last night, we heard the planes, a reassuring sound in a fire. But winds will pick up again, blow through Friday night and get stronger again next week. More than 6,000 personnel now fighting the worst fires in the history of this great city.</p><p>MARK PESTRELLA, DIRECTOR, LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS: Sewer, water, your power system and the transportation system have all been significantly damaged.</p><p>[04:35:00]</p><p>WATT (voice-over): We know the depth of the devastation, we can see it, the death toll. Well, it's just too early to tell.</p><p>SHERIFF ROBERT LUNA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY: At one point, we'll be able to do a more thorough search of these impacted areas. Some of them look like a bomb was dropped in them, where we will be able to bring in canines and other things to help us hopefully not discover too many fatalities. That's our prayer.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): Forty-three acres burned in Hollywood last night. Hollywood, chaos in such a tight urban environment. In Santa Monica, a sunset-to-sunrise curfew kicked in last night as the Palisades fire threatens. So far across L.A., 20 alleged looters arrested, accused of preying on houses, left standing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): Here in Pacific Palisades, where entire neighborhoods are just gone, arson investigators are today on the ground. And the post-mortem is already underway. Did the L.A. mayor's cuts to the fire department budget hamper the effort?</p><p>KAREN BASS, (D) LOS ANGELES MAYOR: There were no reductions that were made that would have impacted the situation.</p><p>WATT (voice-over): And that loss of water in the hydrants here in the Palisades at the peak of the blaze, Governor Gavin Newsom visited again today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why was there no water in the hydrants, Governor?</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): It's off literally --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it going to be different next time?</p><p>NEWSOM: It has to be. WATT (voice-over): But for neighborhoods like this and the people who once lived here, now what?</p><p>WATT: Now, we've met people who have walked miles into the evacuation zone to see if their house is still standing. It's very seldom good news for these people. Most houses are just gone. I've also heard of kids charging people a few bucks to come in on their bicycles to check on houses. The money they're giving to a fund to help the victims of this fire.</p><p>Nick Watt, CNN, Pacific Palisades, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: Amid all the devastation, some are peddling false claims and conspiracy theories. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has been complaining about federal, state and local officials' response to the wildfires and about water shortages in some fire hydrants. And he made false claims that the California governor refused to sign the water restoration declaration. But there's no such document.</p><p>On Thursday, the U.S. president appeared to push back against Trump's comments and the spread of misinformation. Joe Biden explained that utility companies will sometimes shut down power to avoid causing more fires, which means water can't be pumped from hydrants without a generator.</p><p>Chad Hansen is the author of \"Smokescreen, Debunking Wildfire Myths to Save Our Forests and Our Climate.\" He's also a forest and fire ecologist with the John Muir Project. He spoke to my colleague Kim Brunhuber a short while ago about the circumstances that made the L.A. wildfires so dangerous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHAD HANSON, FOREST AND FIRE ECOLOGIST, JOHN MUIR PROJECT: We're seeing the upper end of extreme fire behavior. You know, these fires, the Palisades fire and the Eden fire in particular, we're seeing the result of a convergence of circumstances. A very, very dry fall and early winter, very little precipitation and Santa Ana winds, and not just any Santa Ana winds because they're always powerful, but an extreme version of the Santa Ana winds where we have not just the dry, dry winds with relative humidity in the single digits, but we have wind gusts of 60, 80, 100 miles per hour.</p><p>In conditions like this, these fires are going to spread. They're going to spread fast. They're going to move where the wind puts them and moves them, and it is not possible for firefighting forces to stop fires like this.</p><p>The only thing that they can do in that circumstance is try to get people and their animals out safely and help them evacuate, save homes, save lives. And that's what they prioritize. They prioritize saving lives, and that's what they could do. I don't think anything else could have been done in this circumstance. But, you know, in terms of the water policy, I don't see any evidence that this was about a lack of water. It's about an infrastructure that was designed to put out a fire in a single house with a fire hydrant, and it's perfectly adequate for that.</p><p>Maybe two houses, an apartment building, a commercial structure. The infrastructure with the fire hydrants, that's what it's designed for, you know, individual residential fires. It's not designed to address a situation where you have several hundred homes simultaneously engaged in flames in a fire that's rapidly moving.</p><p>The sky has turned dark because there's so much smoke ending down by the millions, and you've got wind gusts that could blow people off their feet.</p><p>[04:40:03]</p><p>You know, it's -- I don't think this is a time for finger pointing. I think this is a time to soberly consider the evidence of what works best in terms of saving lives and saving homes and how to best protect communities.</p><p>What we need to do, instead of, you know, political opportunism to, you know, promote logging policies from certain members of Congress who have been trying to do that for years. Again, we need to put the partisanship aside and come together and look, you know, carefully at the science and the science is clear. To protect communities, to save lives, it's about home hardening, it's about defensible space pruning, and it's about evacuation planning and assistance.</p><p>And it's about the funding necessary to do those things and provide the technical expertise to communities so they can do it effectively. If we do that, we will save thousands and thousands of homes and many lives.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: From the floods in Valencia to Hurricane Milton last year, climate change has had a heavy price tag attached to it. In fact, it's estimated the current California wildfires have incurred losses worth up to $50 billion. CNN's Anna Stewart has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Last year was very costly due to natural disasters, hurricanes, storms and floods all around the world. Munich Re, the world's biggest insurer, estimated total losses of $320 billion, with $140 billion covered by insurance, so less than half. Climate change is playing a big role, according to Munich Re's chief scientist.</p><p>TOBIAS GRIMM, HEAD OF CLIMATE ADVISORY: We saw a number of extreme weather events in many countries, including Canada, United Arab Emirates, Spain and Brazil. We all have the pictures in mind with the airport in Dubai knee-deep in water, with the city of Valencia where cars were swept away in mud like toys, with areas that were widespread flooded in Brazil, in Central and Eastern Europe, in China and in many other regions. Climate change is showing its claws.</p><p>STEWART: The two costliest, most destructive disasters of last year were both in the United States, hurricanes Helene and Milton. The aftermath led to losses of $56 billion and $38 billion, respectively. Now, the current wildfires in California aren't included in this report, given it's a new year, but JPMorgan Chase has estimated that already economic losses stand close to $50 billion.</p><p>Anna Stewart, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: For many homeowners in California, the devastation wrought by the fire will be compounded by the fact that they don't have insurance to cover the damage. That's because some insurance companies have dropped many customers in the state, because between 2020 and 2022, insurance companies declined to renew 2.8 million homeowner policies in California. That includes more than half a million in L.A County alone.</p><p>The state has set up a program aimed at making alternate insurance available, but it comes with higher premiums and lower coverage, forcing many homeowners to go without.</p><p>Now, 2024 has now officially become the hottest year on record, according to the latest data from Europe's climate monitoring agency, Copernicus. The milestone caps a decade of unprecedented heat, whilst also breaching a critical climate goal.</p><p>CNN's Chad Myers explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: I'm CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, and this is your Copernicus climate change update. For the year 2024, it was the warmest year on record, probably surprising no one. But what did surprise me, 1.6 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And a lot of that was in the oceans.</p><p>You see here for the warmest on this dark red here, warmest in the Indian Ocean, part of the Atlantic. Obviously, we had rapidly intensifying hurricanes, a number of them in the Atlantic, very rapidly intensifying typhoons, cyclones here in the Pacific and also in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>So it was a warm year. It started out very warm. It was much warmer even than 2023, the line that you see here.</p><p>Now, even though we transitioned to La Nina by the end of the year, we were still very, very close to that warm 2023. And so because we had so much area here above 2023, only a little bit of area here below 2023, this turns out to be the warmest year on record for planet Earth.</p><p>There you see the rankings, a little bit of cool water in the Pacific, but not very much. It's very hard to find a cool spot on this map. 1.6 degrees Celsius above what we're trying to hold, which is 1.5.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[04:45:00]</p><p>FOSTER: This just into CNN. Israel has identified the remains of another hostage recovered from Gaza. Military officials say 23-year- old Hamza al-Ziyadnah was found dead in a tunnel in the Rafah area. The announcement came just two days after the remains of his 53-year- old father Yousef also identified. He was found in the same part of Gaza as his son. Both father and son were kidnapped from an Israeli kibbutz where they worked during the Hamas attack on October the 7th, 2023. They belonged to a Muslim Bedouin community that lives in southern Israel.</p><p>Now, the scale of the fire damage in Los Angeles is being revealed as many people begin to return to their communities and the potential health hazards from the wildfires in southern California are serious, even for those far from the flames.

Firefighters are trying to race to control a series of major fires that are burning in Los Angeles as the strong gusty winds that fueled the flames continue to pick up again. At least 10 people have died, and officials are warning the total number could go higher.</p><p>Tens of thousands of homes, businesses, vehicles, they've been utterly destroyed by the flames, with the coastal Palisades fire now the most destructive ever to hit Los Angeles County.</p><p>Latest satellite images show the flames are mostly out in Altadena, but the Eaton fire is still raging there in the mountains.</p><p>The wildfires have pushed air quality to hazardous levels across Southern California. The excessive smoke and ash have led to air quality alerts in much of the region. The tracking site Worldwide Air Quality says the high levels in recent days surpassed even that of New Delhi, a city notorious for air pollution. And the threat to people's health extends far beyond the immediate area of the wildfires.</p><p>CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has advice on how to protect your health.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Just about anything you might imagine is going to be inside that smoke. But it is important to draw a little bit of a distinction between standard forest fire and what they call the wildland urban interface.</p><p>Think about that urban setting that you're looking at there. You're burning everything, plastics and metals. You're unearthing certain metals that are even in the soil, cars and electronics and carpets and drapes. All of that gets into the atmosphere.</p><p>[04:50:00]</p><p>These compounds, benzene and formaldehyde and toluene, all these types of things are in the air and people are breathing them in.</p><p>Now, initially, you may not have sort of classic symptoms of smoke inhalation injury. It may be more sort of burning eyes and scratchy throat, even vaguer symptoms like headaches, for example. But eventually, people may develop breathing difficulties and even chest pain. That's because of the toxicity of the smoke.</p><p>But it's also really small particle sizes as well. Something known as particulate matter 2.5. And what that means is basically particles as small as one twentieth the width of human hair. You breathe that in, that goes into your bronchioles, it goes into your lungs, it gets into your bloodstream and can eventually affect just about every organ in the body. So that's why there's so much concern there. That can cause sort of this systemic inflammation.</p><p>There are things you should do to protect yourself and keep in mind that these toxins in the smoke can travel. They can get miles into the air and they can travel miles with all the wind.</p><p>So even if you're not directly in the path of the smoke or the fires, you need to be careful here. Stay inside as much as possible. If you do need to go outside, think about wearing an N95 mask, a high quality mask.</p><p>Inside, portable indoor air cleaners. That can be really helpful to keep that indoor environment as clean as possible. Now is a good time to look at the filters on your HVAC system. Make sure they're up to date.</p><p>And also, if you're driving around, turn on the recirculation button on your car. You want to keep the air circulating inside without bringing outside air in.</p><p>It's a dangerous situation. Obviously, there's a lot of toxins in the air, but there are also ways to try and protect yourself.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FOSTER: Still ahead, the wildfires in L.A. are impacting the city's biggest sports teams as well. The NFL and NBA react to the disaster next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FOSTER: Fire officials in Los Angeles fear stronger winds and more dry conditions will continue for the next several days into the early part of next week. It'll further complicate efforts to fight the series of fires burning around the city. The crews are battling five major fires right now.</p><p>More than 5,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in Pacific Palisades alone, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.

According to news originating from Hanoi, Vietnam, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"This study's main objective is to propose a hybrid machine learning model based on a gradient boosting algorithm named LightGBM and an artificial ecosystem-based optimization to improve the accuracy of forest fire susceptibility assessment. Four hundred twenty-six historical forest fires from the NASA portal and thirteen conditional factors including elevation, aspect, slope, curvature, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, distance to residence, distance to road, distance to river, temperature, rain, humidity, and wind were used to train the model.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Vietnam National University, \"The model performance was evaluated and compared with other benchmark models using root mean square error, area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC), and overall accuracy. The results show that the proposed model (AUC = 0.9705) outperforms others, such as Random Forest (AUC = 0.958), AdaBoost (AUC = 0.905), Bagging (AUC = 0.945), and Random Subspace (AUC = 0.938), respectively. The final model was interpreted to better understand the most influential factors of forest fire hazards. Implications: This study's main objective is to propose a hybrid machine learning model based on a gradient boosting algorithm called LightGBM and an artificial ecosystem-based optimization to improve the accuracy of forest fire susceptibility assessment. The final model was interpreted using the Shapley (SHAP) values to understand how input factors are related to the fire susceptibility level.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"This study fills a gap in the research literature, searching for optimal algorithms to improve forest fire susceptibility mapping.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Fine-tuning Lightgbm Using an Artificial Ecosystem-based Optimizer for Forest Fire Analysis.

According to news reporting from Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"In satellite imagery, clouds obstruct the ground information, directly impacting various downstream applications. Thus, cloud annotation/cloud detection serves as the initial preprocessing step in remote sensing image analysis.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of Chin. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"Recently, deep learning methods have significantly improved in the field of cloud detection, but training these methods necessitates abundant annotated data, which requires experts with professional domain knowledge. Moreover, the influx of remote sensing data from new satellites has further led to an increase in the cost of cloud annotation. To address the dependence on labeled datasets and professional domain knowledge, this paper proposes an automatic cloud annotation method for satellite remote sensing images, CloudAUE. Unlike traditional approaches, CloudAUE does not rely on labeled training datasets and can be operated by users without domain expertise. To handle the irregular shapes of clouds, CloudAUE firstly employs a convex hull algorithm for selecting cloud and non-cloud regions by polygons. When selecting convex hulls, the cloud region is first selected, and points at the edges of the cloud region are sequentially selected as polygon vertices to form a polygon that includes the cloud region. Then, the same selection is performed on non-cloud regions. Subsequently, the fast KD-Tree algorithm is used for pixel classification. Finally, an uncertainty method is proposed to evaluate the quality of annotation. When the confidence value of the image exceeds a preset threshold, the annotation process terminates and achieves satisfactory results. When the value falls below the threshold, the image needs to undergo a subsequent round of annotation. Through experiments on two labeled datasets, HRC and Landsat 8, CloudAUE demonstrates comparable or superior accuracy to deep learning algorithms, and requires only one to two annotations to obtain ideal results.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"An unlabeled self-built Google Earth dataset is utilized to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of CloudAUE. To show the extension capabilities in various fields, CloudAUE also achieves desirable results on a forest fire dataset. Finally, some suggestions are provided to improve annotation performance and reduce the number of annotations.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Satellite Image Cloud Automatic Annotator with Uncertainty Estimation.

According to news reporting from Rostock, Germany, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Wild and forest fires pose a threat to forests and thereby, in extension, to wild life and humanity. Recent history shows an increase in devastating damages caused by fires.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include German Federal Ministry of Digitalization And Transport. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Rostock: \"Traditional fire detection systems, such as video surveillance, fail in the early stages of a rural forest fire. Such systems would see the fire only when the damage is immense. Novel low-power smoke detection units based on gas sensors can detect smoke fumes in the early development stages of fires. The required proximity is only achieved using a distributed network of sensors interconnected via 5G. In the context of battery-powered sensor nodes, energy efficiency becomes a key metric. Using AI classification combined with XAI enables improved confidence regarding measurements.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"In this work, we present both a low-power gas sensor for smoke detection and a system elaboration regarding energy-efficient communication schemes and XAI-based evaluation. We show that leveraging edge processing in a smart way combined with buffered data samples in a 5G communication network yields optimal energy efficiency and rating results.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: XplAInable: Explainable AI Smoke Detection at the Edge.

When asked what Donald Trump would do policy-wise to help Black Americans in a second term, Donalds gave an answer that was perfect but not how he thinks.</url></p><p>DONALDS: What Donald Trump was going to do is going to be actually quite similar to what he did in his first term.

Donalds decided to victim blame California rather than condemn a president willing to hurt a state for political reasons.</p><p>DONALDS: I think, when you look at Florida versus California, taking in hurricane-force winds and massive flooding is one thing. There's not much the state of Florida can do to prevent that. You compare that with California's environmental policy, a lot of their forest fires are mostly caused because the state of California blocks the management of their lands. They don't clear the underbrush. We do that here in Florida, which is why you don't have the major issues of massive forest fires raging through our state. But California doesn't do the simple work of clearing underbrush. []</p><p>Bash, for her part, tried to explain another clear reason why Florida gets less forest fires than California.</p><p>BASH: Well, the topography of California and Florida, as you know, are very different. []</p><p>Kinda hard for forest fires to occur when your (and this writer's former) state is mostly swamp and humidity. Donalds, who has to leave Florida in order to be in Congress, should know this. It's the same reason that California doesn't have an invasive  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/us/iguanas-florida-overpopulation-trnd/index.html\">iguana problem or why</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-humid-states\">they can have lovely patio furniture without it</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://shopatzing.com/blog/patio-materials-in-floridas-tropical-climate/\">turning into mold spore incubators. Not clearing moist underbrush won't raise the forest fire risks in Florida, Donalds.</url></p><p>But Donalds continued trying to make bad arguments until Bash changed the subject to the 2024 election. Bash asked Donalds if he would follow the new version of the Electoral Count Act, which was passed in the wake of January, and which insurrectionists Trump allies call 'unconstitutional.'</p><p>Donalds would not commit to obeying the law and certify an election if the Republicans lose.</p><p>DONALDS: As long as states and jurisdictions follow election procedures in their states, there will be no problem for me or anybody on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Donalds preceded to try to peddle the same election conspiracies he and Trump have for four years, and Bash debunked them while ending this idiotic segment.</p><p>Mike Johnson: Evangelical Weasel</p><p>The current speaker of the House appeared on NBC's 'Meet The Press' and CBS's 'Face The Nation,' bringing his trademark faux sincerity smugness.</p><p>After lying about and being  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wonkette.com/p/halfway-through-hurricane-season\">a feckless asshole about FEMA funding and disaster response, since he won't call the House back to vote for aid, Johnson then said similar lies to Donalds about the 2024 election on 'Meet The Press.'</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AIiTpBXg_qQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\">https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AIiTpBXg_qQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0</url></p><p>Johnson, who is a noted election denier, then tried to do some good ol' historical revision about January 6.</p><p>KRISTEN WELKER: Regardless of who wins you'll certify the results?</p><p>JOHNSON: Regardless, of course it - Yes, if the election is free and fair and legal, and we pray and hope that it is.

No, it - No, it shouldn't. [] Listen, Democrats have objected to slates of electors in every single election this century when a Republican president has won. Every single time.</p><p>WELKER: And yet, they all conceded. And yet they have conceded.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. And that's the point.</p><p>WELKER: Former President Trump has yet to concede in 2020.</p><p>JOHNSON: That's - no, the point is the process works. We have the peaceful transfer of power.

Oppressive child labor means, among other things, employing 16- and 17-year-olds in non-agricultural occupations that the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) deems hazardous. The FLSA also bars manufacturers from shipping (or delivering for shipment) any goods in commerce if oppressive child labor was used in the facility that produced the goods ('hot goods').</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, many states have child labor laws. Nothing in the FLSA excuses noncompliance with a state law that establishes a higher standard than that provided in the FLSA.</p><p>Restrictions on Hazardous Occupations for Minors Ages 16 and 17</p><p>The WHD has identified  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/43-child-labor-non-agriculture\">17 occupations too dangerous for minors who are 16 or 17, with limited exceptions. As a general rule, minors aged 16 and 17 may not work in the following occupations:</url></p><p>Manufacturing and storing of explosives or articles containing explosive components</p><p>Motor-vehicle driving and working as an outside helper on roads, mines, excavations, or near logging and sawmill operations</p><p>Coal mining</p><p>Occupations in forest fire fighting, forest fire prevention, timber tract operations, forestry service, logging, and sawmilling or other similar mills</p><p>Working with power-driven woodworking machines</p><p>Any occupations involving exposure to radioactive substances and ionizing radiations</p><p>Working with a power-driven hoisting apparatus, including forklifts</p><p>Working with power-driven, metal-forming, punching, and shearing machines</p><p>Any type of mining other than coal</p><p>Operating power-driven meat-processing equipment in retail and wholesale establishments and most occupations involving meat and poultry slaughtering, packing, processing, and rendering</p><p>Working with power-driven bakery machines</p><p>Working with power-driven balers, compactors, and paper processing machines</p><p>Manufacturing bricks, tile, and similar products</p><p>Working with power-driven saws and similar products</p><p>Wrecking, demolition, and shipbreaking operations</p><p>Roofing operations and any other work on or about a roof</p><p>Excavation operations</p><p>Under the FLSA, 16- and 17-year-olds may be employed for unlimited hours in any non-agricultural, non-hazardous position. Some states, however, are reacting to labor shortages by taking a closer look at hours of work and time schedule restrictions on youth employment, with some decreasing existing restrictions on work schedules and others increasing such restrictions. Also, some states require rest and meal break periods within the workday for minors.</p><p>Age Certificates</p><p>Employers who have a valid age certificate on file for a minor are protected from FLSA violations relating to that minor's age, so it may be a good idea to obtain certificates if there is any reason to believe a minor's stated age is inaccurate. Some states require employers to obtain work permits for minors they employ.</p><p>Minimum Wage and Recordkeeping</p><p>Minors are generally covered by the same FLSA wage and hour protections as adults. For example, minors have the same rights under the FLSA to minimum wage and overtime pay. However, under federal law, for the first 90 consecutive calendar days after hire, employers may pay employees under age 20 any wage rate that is at least $4.25 an hour instead of the federal minimum wage-unless prohibited by state law. Where a state requires payment of a youth minimum wage higher than $4.25 an hour, the higher standard would apply.</p><p>The recordkeeping requirements of the FLSA also apply to the employment of minors.</p><p>Consequences for Violations</p><p>Any person who willfully violates the FLSA's child labor law provisions restricting the use of oppressive child labor is subject to significant fines for each violation (especially if a minor employee is injured) and/or imprisonment for up to six months. Recent WHD enforcement actions have led to  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20240502\">penalties in the millions of dollars, as well as additional financial impacts resulting from stopping the flow of 'hot goods' into commerce.</url></p><p>Apprentice Exemption</p><p>Apprentices may be exempt from regulations restricting some hazardous non-agricultural occupations when the following conditions are met:</p><p>They are employed in a craft recognized as a trade that offers apprenticeships.</p><p>Any hazardous work they perform is incidental to their training; intermittent and for short periods of time; and under the direct and close supervision of a journeyman as a necessary part of the training.</p><p>They are registered by the DOL as employed under the agency's standards; registered by a state agency recognized by the DOL; or employed under a written apprenticeship agreement and under conditions that the DOL finds substantially conform with federal and state standards.</p><p>Student-Learner Exemption</p><p>Student-learners may be exempt from regulations restricting some hazardous non-agricultural occupations when they are enrolled in a course of study and training in a cooperative vocational training program under a recognized state or local educational authority or a substantially similar private school program. Each student-learner must be employed under a written agreement that provides the following:</p><p>That any hazardous work they perform is incidental to the student's training; intermittent and for short periods of time; and under the direct and close supervision of a qualified and experienced person.</p><p>Safety instructions to be given by the school and correlated by the employer with on-the-job training.</p><p>A schedule of organized and progressive work processes to be performed on the job.</p><p>Each written agreement must contain the name of the student-learner and be signed by the employer and the school coordinator or principal, both of whom must keep a copy of the document on file. High school graduates who have completed this training for an occupation may be employed in that occupation even if they are under 18.</p><p>OSHA Requirements</p><p>Finally, minor employees should be fully trained on applicable standards promulgated by the DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Not only may an injury to a minor employee result in an increased child labor penalty, but employers can also expect the WHD to report any perceived safety issues to OSHA.</p><p>Takeaway for Employers</p><p>The FLSA establishes general standards for employment of 16- and 17-year-olds across the U.S. in hazardous and non-hazardous occupations. Many states, however, impose or are considering additional restrictions or restrictions that are different from those currently in place. Employers will need to take a look at all states in which they operate to ensure compliance with applicable law on additional hazardous occupations, maximum hour and time-of-day restrictions, and recordkeeping requirements.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewerExternal.aspx?fid=65e3681f-bada-449b-9332-83de7d60301f\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXJD-JSUP10541151967753167325824700059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C94-N151-JCMN-Y18F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1175\"/><timeReceived>11:51 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

According to news reporting out of Nanjing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an efficient tool for monitoring forest fire due to its advantages, e.g., cost-saving, lightweight, flexible, etc. Semantic segmentation can provide a model aircraft to rapidly and accurately determine the location of a forest fire.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Joint Fund of Science &amp; Technology Department of Liaoning Province And State Key Laboratory of Robotics; National Natural Science Foundation of China. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Nanjing Forestry University: \"However, training a semantic segmentation model requires a large number of labeled images, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to generate. To address the lack of labeled images, we propose, in this paper, a semi-supervised learning-based segmentation network, SemiFSNet. By taking into account the unique characteristics of UAV-acquired imagery of forest fire, the proposed method first uses occlusion-aware data augmentation for labeled data to increase the robustness of the trained model. In SemiFSNet, a dynamic encoder network replaces the ordinary convolution with dynamic convolution, thus enabling the learned feature to better represent the fire feature with varying size and shape. To mitigate the impact of complex scene background, we also propose a feature refinement module by integrating an attention mechanism to highlight the salient feature information, thus improving the performance of the segmentation network. Additionally, consistency regularization is introduced to exploit the rich information that unlabeled data contain, thus aiding the semi-supervised learning.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on the Flame dataset and Corsican dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is competitive to its fully supervised learning counterpart.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Semi-Supervised Learning for Forest Fire Segmentation Using UAV Imagery.

According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, \"Forest fires have frequently occurred and caused great harm to people's lives. Many researchers use machine learning techniques to predict forest fires by considering spatio-temporal data features.\" </p><p><br/> Funders for this research include Beijing Municipal Science And Technology Project. <br/> The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: \"However, it is difficult to efficiently obtain the features from large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous data. There is a lack of a method that can effectively extract features required by machine learning-based forest fire predictions from multi-source spatio-temporal data. This paper proposes a forest fire prediction method that integrates spatio-temporal knowledge graphs and machine learning models. This method can fuse multi-source heterogeneous spatio-temporal forest fire data by constructing a forest fire semantic ontology and a knowledge graph-based spatio-temporal framework. This paper defines the domain expertise of forest fire analysis as the semantic rules of the knowledge graph. This paper proposes a rule-based reasoning method to obtain the corresponding data for the specific machine learning-based forest fire prediction methods, which are dedicated to tackling the problem with real-time prediction scenarios.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This paper performs experiments regarding forest fire predictions based on real-world data in the experimental areas Xichang and Yanyuan in Sichuan province. The results show that the proposed method is beneficial for the fusion of multi-source spatio-temporal data and highly improves the prediction performance in real forest fire prediction scenarios.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Based Forest Fire Prediction with Multi Source Heterogeneous Data.

The Hurricane Ridge Fire began burning Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 23. More than 85 firefighters were working the fire as of Tuesday.</p><p>The cause of the Hurricane Ridge Fire is under investigation. No structures were burned.</p><p>When the fire broke out, firefighters initially attempted to construct containment lines, but due to the steep terrain and difficulty accessing the fire's edge, they instead switched tactics to use gravel forest service roads as natural fire breaks.</p><p>Helicopters were used for water drops to reduce the intensity of the fire near the firelines, which included Cold Springs Road as a boundary to the north and Hurricane Creek Road as a boundary to the south.</p><p>Aided by rain on Sunday, firefighters on Monday were able to improve contingency firelines around the perimeter of the Hurricane Creek drainage. Then on Tuesday, firefighters conducted burn out operations to remove understory and downed wood between the active fire and the fireline. Burn out operations reduce the fuel load to lessen the fire's intensity, in hopes that the fire wouldn't jump the firelines once it reached them.</p><p>Meanwhile, several cabins were located inside the firelines. Crews protected the structures and successfully kept the fire off them.</p><p>Due to the proximity to Interstate 40, smoke impacted visibility for drivers, especially Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>The forest service thanked firefighters for their response and sacrifices over the Thanksgiving Holiday.</p><p>The public is asked to avoid the area as not to interfere with firefighting operations and to exercise caution in the area as conditions will remain dry and windy throughout the area over the next several days.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

The Bitterroot National Forest Fire Management team advises that people know what precautions to take during this level.</p><p>Very High fire danger means fires start easily from all causes, and immediately spread fast. Small fires can quickly become large fires and exhibit extreme fire intensity. These fires can be difficult to control and will often become much larger and longer-lasting fires.</p><p>Spring and early summer rains have resulted in a tall, thick crop of grasses that are now starting to dry and cure, increasing the likelihood of a larger, more intense fire. Even in the timbered stands, heavy fuels like standing dead trees and logs are already extremely dry.</p><p>It is imperative that residents and visitors alike exercise caution when recreating outdoors. Several unattended campfires have been discovered by forest personnel, especially around Lake Como Recreation Area and Lost Horse.</p><p>\"Just because there are no flames, doesn't mean the campfire is out,\" said Russell Buzzell, Fire Prevention Officer. Buzzell reminds people to drown a fire with water, stir it, and then touch the area to make sure it's cool to the touch. \"If it's too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave,\" he said.</p><p>Please follow these fire safety tips.</p><p>* Keep campfires small and completely extinguish them before leaving camp. Always add water, stir it, and make sure all embers are out. It is illegal to have unattended campfires.</p><p>* Smokers should light up only in areas cleared of all flammable debris. Cigarette butts should never be thrown from vehicle windows.</p><p>* Fireworks are illegal on public lands: every forest, every campsite, every day. Never light fireworks in the woods.</p><p>* Ensure your vehicle is properly maintained, with nothing dragging on the ground. A loose safety chain or dangling muffler can send a shower of sparks into dry vegetation.</p><p>* Keep vehicles off dry grass. The catalytic converter may contact the vegetation and start a fire.</p><p>* Recreational shooting? Take precautions! Never shoot into dry vegetation and always make sure you're shooting in a safe location, away from roads, trails, campsites, and occupied areas. Be aware that shooting exploding targets is prohibited on National Forest System lands.

Always check with your local Ranger Station prior to your trip to get the most up-to-date information on fire danger and fire restrictions for the area.

For fire crew safety, they plan to contain it primarily within existing roads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"After reviewing all the data, I believe this is the best approach to balance what Mother Nature has given us while keeping our crews and the public safe,\" said District Ranger Angie Krall, referring to the lightning that caused the fire. \"There's been plenty of rain, with a lot more forecasted, so I'll take what we can get to restore this small section of forest.\"</p><p>The strategy is called \"confine and contain.\" Crews will manage the fire within a predetermined area (confine) and use points to stop the fire's spread (contain). In this case, crews will conduct firing operations within a 600-acre area as early as July 13 and use roads as containment lines.</p><p>The Yeso Fire was first reported on July 9 by fire personnel in the Deadman Lookout on the Santa Fe National Forest. Carson National Forest crews have since monitored the fire, which has grown to 96 acres.</p><p>There are no current evacuations or closures associated with the fire, which is burning southeast of Canjilon and northeast of Ghost Ranch. Visitors and residents may observe smoke. Hikers on nearby trails (Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and Yeso Trail) or visitors on nearby Forest Service roads may see flames and encounter fire personnel.</p><p>The public can get updates on InciWeb (<url normalizedValue=\"https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/nmcaf-yeso-fire\">https://inciweb.wildfire.gov/incident-information/nmcaf-yeso-fire</url>) or by calling public information officers at 505-216-6793. Smoke sensitive residents can call to borrow a limited number of portable HEPA air filters.</p><p>An overview of the fire, including strategy, fire ecology and how it plays into larger initiatives is available online (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/fire/?cid=fseprd1188972\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/carson/fire/?cid=fseprd1188972</url>).</p><p>The Yeso Fire is primarily burning in a ponderosa pine forest, where fire was historically frequent and low severity. Fire managers expect to observe some moderate severity fire, in which single trees or stands are fully consumed. Such effects help return the forest to historic conditions, where stands are less dense with openings in the canopy. This, along with standing dead and down trees, are beneficial for wildlife.</p><p>The strategy for this fire is part of larger initiatives to benefit residents and downstream cities.</p><p>Since 2011, Forest Service staff and partners have invested over $10 million in the Canjilon Wildland Urban Interface Project immediately to the north of the Yeso Fire. Many adjacent private landowners, with the assistance of the state, are contributing by thinning and applying prescribed fire on their own properties.</p><p>The fire is also within the expansive two-state Rio Chama Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/features/common-ground-rio-chama\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/features/common-ground-rio-chama</url>), where governments and partners are coming together to address forest and watershed health that is critical to local communities and downstream urban areas.</p><p>Nationally, the Forest Service is implementing the Wildfire Crisis Strategy (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis</url>) to increase the pace and scale of work to reduce risk from wildfire.

Evacuation orders have been downgraded to evacuation warnings for more than 14,000 people.</p><p>Families are dealing with the aftermath.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>ELISE PRESTON (voiceover): In unimaginable loss, the ferocious Mountain Fire in Camarillo, California, sparing little in its 32-mile path.</p><p>Janice Lindsey (sp?) is one of the many homeowners who lost everything to the inferno, including her two cats.</p><p>JANICE LINDSEY (Homeowner): We had our hands on both of them at one point, and they broke free. I`m certain they didn`t get out.</p><p>ELISE PRESTON: While residents assessed the damage, nearly 3,000 firefighters are mopping up hot spots. More than 20,000 acres still burn with 26 percent containment.</p><p>In the East, wildfires have ignited in several states. In New York, a tragic loss, 18-year-old Dariel Vasquez, a State Parks employee died battling the Jennings Creek Fire.</p><p>The fire is also raging in New Jersey. Over 2,500 acres torched, zero percent containment. Dry conditions have made the Garden State a tinder box.

Some areas got more than 30 inches. Thousands lost power. New Mexico was also pummeled.</p><p>These cattle, as you can see there, weathered it together. Seven more inches of snow fell after this video was shot.</p><p>As for what`s ahead, let`s check back in with CBS News meteorologist, Andrew Kozak.</p><p>ANDREW KOZAK: Yes, Jericka, good evening.</p><p>Good news for the people and for the cows in this area. Not only are we going to be looking at sunshine to start the week off, 40s, 50s and 60s for these areas that received several feet of snow, that`s going to lead to some good melting.</p><p>Now to California. I`ve highlighted Ventura County. In the morning, it is not going to be as bad. In fact, this will help the firefighters with those fires out there, but then by the afternoon, we`re going to be looking at a wind advisory with winds gusting over 25 to 35 miles per hour.</p><p>It`s going to push a lot of that smoke inland, but it also could help spread the fire, so we`re not done yet.</p><p>Now we are done with the dry streak in the Northeast. So nice to finally see areas like New York and Philadelphia get a soaking rain into Monday morning. It`s not everything we need, but it certainly helps.</p><p>Looking at Monday at a glance, Pacific Northwest, we have rain and snow for the higher elevations. Nice, sunny and comfortable in the Midwest, and after that soaking rain in the northeast, up and down 95, we`re looking at a dry and sunny start to the week -- Jericka.</p><p>JERICKA DUNCAN: Andrew Kozak, thank you so much.</p><p>Tonight, an arrest in Tuskegee, Alabama where at least one person is dead and several injured after a shooting at the university`s 100th homecoming.</p><p>CBS` Jason Allen is there for us tonight with the details.

That`s left Democrats soul searching about their losses from allies to a former Biden primary challenger.</p><p>REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D-MN): We`ve used condemnation of Donald Trump versus invitation to Donald Trump supporters.</p><p>REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans.</p><p>NATALIE BRAND: Republicans are eager to enact their agenda.</p><p>SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN): I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven`t seen, as you mentioned in 36 years.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>NATALIE BRAND: Now tonight, \"The Washington Post\" reports that Trump talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin late last week and told him not to escalate the war in Ukraine.</p><p>A spokesman for Trump says he will not comment on private conversations between Trump and world leaders.

According to California-based Khan Academy, the stone statues \"were probably carved to commemorate important ancestors and were made from around 1000 C.E. until the second half of the seventeenth century. Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 moai.

There is no money to prevent fires on Easter Island in the more than 32,000 archaeological sites.

Another person died in Grayvoron city in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p><p>Razvozhayev said 151 people were wounded in Sevastopol. Falling rocket fragments caused a forest fire of over 150 square meters and set a residential building alight, RIA Novosti said, noting that a fifth missile had exploded over the city.</p><p>Russia's Defense Ministry said both Ukraine and the U.S. bore \"responsibility for a deliberate missile strike on civilians.\" It said that U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles were used in the Ukrainian attack.</p><p>Razvozhayev declared today a day of mourning in Sevastopol, with public events canceled.</p><p>Air defenses overnight shot down 33 Ukrainian drones over Russia's western Bryansk, Smolensk, Lipetsk and Tula regions, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Sunday. No casualties or damage were reported.</p><p>A fresh attack on Kharkiv killed at least one person and wounded 11 on Sunday, according to local officials. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the city was attacked by a guided bomb and that around half of Kharkiv was without electricity because of the strike.</p><p>Sunday's attacks came after Russia struck Kharkiv on Saturday afternoon with four aerial bombs, hitting a five-story residential building and killing three people. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said that 41 people were still being treated for injuries on Sunday.</p><p>In a video address following the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's partners to bolster its air defenses.</p><p>\"Modern air defense systems for Ukraine - such as Patriots, accelerated training of our pilots for F-16s, and most importantly, sufficient range for our weapons - are truly necessary,\" he said.</p><p>Two people were wounded by falling debris when two Russian missiles were shot down over the Kyiv region overnight, Ukraine's air force commander Mykola Oleschuk said.</p><p>Regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin of Ukraine's partly occupied Donetsk region said that Russian attacks on Saturday killed two people and wounded four.</p><p>In other developments, the Ukrainian Navy released photos Sunday that it says confirm the destruction of a warehouse in Russia's southern Krasnodar region used to launch and store Iranian-designed Shahed drones.</p><p>Navy officials said training instructors and cadets were killed in the attack on Friday night. Moscow has not yet commented on the reports, but officials said that air defenses shot down a number of drones in the region overnight on Friday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELHLD-7747551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELHLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CB9-TCD1-JCDM-J08N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156396</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Woodward Communications, Inc.

Officials have essentially curtailed the supply of water available to LA firefighters, even as they have drastically increased the supply of combustible kindling and vegetation which feeds these wildfires. The latter, in turn, are being amplified by the seasonal Santa Ana winds, which have visited the California coast since time immemorial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The kindling at issue stems from forest management policies that prevent the removal of excess fuel via controlled burns, which are fires intentionally set by forest managers to reduce the buildup of hazardous fuels. As we amplify below, red tape and bureaucratic obstacles have frequently delayed or prevented these controlled burns, allowing brush, dead trees, and other flammable materials to accumulate excessively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this case, state and Federal politicians have simultaneously curtailed the supply of water available to Los Angeles firefighters in order to protect so-called endangered species. Specifically, southern California is being held hostage by sharp curtailment of the water pumping rates from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in order to protect the Delta Smelt and Chinook Salmon.</p><p>These former are shiny but tiny little buggers, as suggested by the handful of Smelt in the first picture below. But apparently, if they are protected, fished, and then fried up, they make for a certain kind of delicacy.</p><p>Needless to say, California is entitled to stew in the foolishness of its own policies-if that's what its voters really want. But its self-imposed misery should not be an occasion for more howling in favor of Washington policies to fight climate change.</p><p>At least with respect to the latter, the Donald has his head screwed on right. And he does not hesitate to opine on the matter, which is all to the good of balancing what has otherwise been a wholly one-sided and utterly misleading Climate Crisis narrative. Naturally, the latter has been promulgated and peddled by statists because it provides yet one more big, scary, and urgent reason for an \"all of government\" campaign of more spending, borrowing, regulating, and the curtailing of free market enterprise and personal liberty.</p><p>So let us once again review the bogus case for AGW or what is known as Anthropogenic Global Warming. And perforce it must start with the geological and paleontological evidence, which overwhelmingly says that today's average global temperature of about 15 degrees C and CO2 concentrations of 420 ppm are nothing to fret about. And even if they rise to about 17-18 degrees C and 500-600 ppms, respectively, by the end of the century owing mainly to a natural warming cycle that has been underway since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in 1850, it may well on balance improve the lot of mankind.</p><p>After all, bursts of civilization during the last 10,000 years uniformly occurred during the warmer red portion of the graph below. The great civilizations of the Yellow, Indus, Nile, and Tigris/Euphrates river valleys, the Minoan era, the Greco-Roman civilization, the Medieval flowering, and the industrial and technological revolutions of the present era all were enabled by periods of elevated temperatures. At the same time, the several lapses into \"dark ages\" happened when the climate turned colder (blue).</p><p>And that's only logical. When it's warmer and wetter, growing seasons are longer and crop yields are better-regardless of the agricultural technology and practices of the moment. And it's better for human and community health, too-most of the deadly plagues of history have occurred under colder climes, such as the Black Death of 1344-1350.</p><p>Yet the Climate Crisis narrative deep-sixes this massive body of \"the science\" by means of two deceptive devices. Without them, the entire AGW story doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.</p><p>First, it ignores the entirety of the planet's pre-Holocene (last 10,000 years) history, even though the science shows that more than 90% of the time in the last 600 million years global temperatures (blue line) and CO2 levels (black line) have been higher than at present; and that 50% of the time they were much higher-with temperatures in the range of 22 degrees C or 50% higher than current levels.</p><p>That's far beyond anything projected by the most unhinged climate models today. But, crucially, the planetary climate systems did not go into a doomsday loop of ever increasing temperatures ending in a scorching meltdown. To the contrary, warming epochs were always checked and reversed by powerful countervailing forces.</p><p>Even the history the alarmists do acknowledge has been grotesquely falsified. As we have demonstrated elsewhere, the so-called \"hockey stick\" of the most recent 1,000 years in which temperatures were allegedly flat until 1850 and are now rising to supposedly dangerous levels is a complete crock. It was fraudulently manufactured by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to \"cancel\" the fact that temperatures in the pre-industrial world of the Medieval Warm Period (1000-1200 AD) were actually significantly higher than at present.</p><p>Secondly, it is falsely claimed that global warming is a one-way street in which rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and especially CO2 is causing the earth's heat balance to continuously increase. The truth, however, is that higher CO2 concentrations are a consequence and byproduct, not a driver and cause, of the current naturally rising (and falling) global temperature cycles.</p><p>Again, the now \"canceled\" history of Planet Earth knocks the CO2-forcing proposition into a cocked hat. During the Cretaceous Period between 145 and 66 million years (third orange panel) ago a natural experiment provided complete absolution for the vilified CO2 molecule. During that period, global temperatures rose dramatically from 17 degrees C to 25 degrees C-a level far above anything today's Climate Howlers have ever projected.</p><p>Alas, CO2 wasn't the culprit. According to the science, ambient CO2 concentrations actually tumbled during the 80 million years expanse of the Cretaceous, dropping from 2,000 ppm to 900 ppm on the eve of the Extinction Event 66 million years ago. So temperature and CO2 concentrations actually moved in the opposite directions. Big time.</p><p>You would think that this powerful countervailing fact would give the CO2 witch-hunters pause, but that would be to ignore what the whole climate change brouhaha is actually about. That is, it's not about science, human health, and well-being, or the survival of Planet Earth; it's about politics and the ceaseless search of politicians and statists for control of modern economic and social life. The resulting aggrandizement of state power, in turn, is mightily assisted by the Beltway political class and the apparatchiks and racketeers who gain power and pelf from the anti-fossil fuels campaign.</p><p>Indeed, the Climate Crisis narrative is the kind of ritualized policy mantra that has been concocted over and again by the political class and the permanent nomenklatura of the modern state-professors, think-tankers, lobbyists, career apparatchiks, officialdom-in order to gather and exercise state power.</p><p>To paraphrase the great Randolph Bourne, inventing purported failings of capitalism-such as a propensity to burn too much hydrocarbon-is the health of the state. Indeed, fabrication of false problems and threats that purportedly can only be solved by heavy-handed state intervention has become the modus operandi of a political class that has usurped near complete control of modern democracy.</p><p>So doing, however, the career political class and associated ruling elites have gotten used to such unimpeded success that they have become sloppy, superficial, careless, and dishonest. For instance, the minute we get a summer heat wave or an event like the current LA fires these natural weather events are jammed into the global warming narrative with nary a second thought by the lip-syncing journalists of the MSM.</p><p>Yet there is absolutely no scientific basis for all this tom-tom beating. For instance, on the related issue of heat waves and dry period wildfires, NOAA publishes a heat wave index. The latter is based on extended temperature spikes which last more than 4 days and which would be expected to occur only once every ten years based on the historical data.</p><p>As is evident from the chart below, the only true heat wave spikes we have had in the last 125 years were during the Dust Bowl heat waves of the 1930s. The frequency of mini-heat wave spikes since 1960 is actually no greater than it was during the 1895-1935 period.</p><p>Likewise, all it takes is a good Cat 3 hurricane and they are off to the races, gumming loudly about AGW. Of course, this ignores entirely NOAA's own data as summarized in what is known as the ACE (accumulated cyclone energy) index.</p><p>This index was first developed by the renowned hurricane expert and Colorado State University professor, William Gray. It uses a calculation of a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds every six hours. The latter is then multiplied by itself to get the index value and accumulated for all storms for all regions to get an index value for the entire year. That's shown below for the past 170 years (the blue line is the seven-year rolling average).</p><p>Your editor has an especially high regard for Professor Gray-not the least because he was roundly vilified by the very inexpert, Al Gore. But back in our private equity days, we invested in a Property-Cat company, which was in the super-hazardous business of insuring against the extreme layers of damage caused by very bad hurricanes and earthquakes. So setting the premiums correctly was no trifling business and it was the analytics, long-term databases, and current-year forecasts of Professor Gray upon which our underwriters crucially depended.</p><p>That is to say, hundreds of billions of insurance cover was then and still is being written with the ACE index as a crucial input. Yet if you examine the 7-year rolling average (blue line) in the chart, it is evident that ACE was as high (or higher) in the 1950s and 1960s as it is today, and that the same was true of the late 1930s and the 1880-1900 periods.</p><p>To be sure, the blue line is not flat as a board because there are natural short-term cycles, as amplified below, which drive the fluctuations shown in the chart. But there is no \"science\" extractable from the chart that supports the alleged linkage between the current natural warming cycle and worsening hurricanes.</p><p>The above is an aggregate index of all storms and is therefore as comprehensive a measure as exists. But for want of doubt, the next three panels look at hurricane data at the individual storm count level. The pink portion of the bars represent the number of big, dangerous Cat 3-5 storms, while the red portion reflects the number of lesser Cat 1-2 storms and the blue area the number of tropical storms that did not reach Cat 1 intensity.</p><p>The bars accumulate the number of storms in 5-year intervals and reflect recorded activity back to 1851. The reason we present three panels-for the Eastern Caribbean, Western Caribbean, and Bahamas/Turks and Caicos, respectively, is that the trends in these three sub-regions clearly diverge. And that's actually the smoking gun.</p><p>If global warming was generating more hurricanes as the MSM constantly maintains, the increase would be uniform across all of these sub-regions, but it's clearly not. Since the year 2000, for example,</p><p>- The Eastern Caribbean has had a modest increase in both tropical storms and higher rated Cats relative to most of the past 170 years;<br/>- The Western Caribbean has not been unusual at all, and, in fact, has been well below the higher counts during the 1880-1920 period;<br/>- The Bahamas/Turks and Caicos region since 2000 has actually been well weaker than during 1930-1960 and 1880-1900.</p><p>The actual truth of the matter is that Atlantic hurricane activity is generated by atmospheric and ocean temperature conditions in the eastern Atlantic and North Africa. Those forces, in turn, are heavily influenced by the presence of an El Nino or La Nina in the Pacific Ocean. El Ni\u00f1o events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less favorable environment for hurricane formation and decreasing tropical storm activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Ni\u00f1a causes an increase in hurricane activity due to a decrease in wind shear.</p><p>These Pacific Ocean events, of course, have never been correlated with the low level of natural global warming now underway.</p><p>The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may also undergo a 50-70-year cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Again, these cycles are unrelated to global warming trends since 1850.</p><p>Still, scientists have reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century (@1700) and found five periods with elevated hurricane activity averaging 3-5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40-60 years each; and six other more quiescent periods averaging 1.5-2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10-20 years each. These periods are associated with a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance, which is responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1-2 per year, and clearly not a product of AGW.</p><p>Moreover, like in so many other cases the very long-term records of storm activity also rule out AGW because there was none for most of the time during the last 3,000 years, for instance. Yet according to a proxy record for that period from coastal lake sediments on Cape Cod, hurricane activity has increased significantly during the last 500-1,000 years versus earlier periods-but even that increase happened long before temperatures and carbon concentrations reached 20th-century levels.</p><p>In short, there is no reason to believe that these well understood precursor conditions and longer-term hurricane trends have been impacted by the modest increase in average global temperatures since the LIA ended in 1850.</p><p>As it happens, the same story is true with respect to wildfires like the current LA inferno. This has been the third category of natural disaster that the Climate Howlers have glommed onto. But in this case it's the aforementioned bad forestry management, not man-made global warming, which has turned much of California into a dry wood fuel dump.</p><p>And don't take our word for it. This quotation below comes from the George Soros-funded Pro Publica, which is not exactly a right-wing tin foil hat outfit. It points out that environmentalists have so shackled Federal and state forest management agencies that today's tiny \"controlled burns\" are but an infinitesimal fraction of what Mother Nature herself accomplished before the helping hand of today's purportedly enlightened political authorities arrived on the scene:</p><p>Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California's agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change.</p><p>We live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres - an area about the size of Maine - to restabilize in terms of fire.</p><p>In short, if you don't clear and burn out the deadwood, you build up nature-defying tinderboxes that then require only a lightning strike, a spark from an unrepaired power line, or human carelessness to ignite into a raging inferno. As one 40-year conservationist and expert summarized,</p><p>...There's only one solution, the one we know yet still avoid. \"We need to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load.\"</p><p>The failure to do just such controlled burns is exactly what is behind the LA wildfire today. That is, a dramatically larger human footprint in the fire-prone shrublands and chaparral (dwarf trees) areas along the coasts has increased the risk residents will start fires, accidentally or otherwise. California's population doubled from 1970 to 2020, from about 20 million people to nearly 40 million people, and nearly all of the gain was in the coastal areas.</p><p>Under those conditions, California's strong, naturally-occurring winds, which crest periodically, as is occurring at the moment, are the main culprit which fuels and spreads the human-set blazes in the shrublands. The Diablo winds in the north of the state and the Santa Ana winds in the south can actually reach hurricane force, as has also been the case this week. As the winds move West over California mountains and down toward the coast, they compress, warm, and intensify.</p><p>These winds, in turn, blow flames and carry embers, spreading the fires quickly before they can be contained. And on top of that, the Santa Ana winds also function as Mother Nature's blow dryer. As they come down the mountains toward the sea, the hot winds dry the surface vegetation and deadwood rapidly and powerfully, paving the way for the blowing embers to fuel the spread of wildfires down the slopes.</p><p>Among other proofs that industrialization and fossil fuels aren't the culprit is the fact that researchers have shown that when California was occupied by indigenous communities, wildfires would burn up some 4.5 million acres a year. That's nearly 6X the level experienced during the 2010-2019 period, when wildfires burned an average of just 775,000 acres annually in California.</p><p>Beyond the untoward clash of all of these natural forces of climate and ecology with misguided government forest and shrubland husbandry policies, there is actually an even more dispositive smoking gun, as it were.</p><p>To wit, the Climate Howlers have at least not yet embraced the patent absurdity that the planet's purportedly rising temperatures have targeted the Blue State of California for special punishment. Yet when we look at the data for forest fires we find, alas, that unlike California and Oregon, the US as a whole experienced the weakest fire years in 2020 since 2010.</p><p>That's right. As of August 24 each year, the 10-year average burn had been 5.114 million acres across the US, but in 2020 it was 28% lower at 3.714 million acres.</p><p>Indeed, what the above chart shows is that on a national basis there has been no worsening trend at all during the decade ending in 2020, just huge oscillations year-to-year driven not by some grand planetary heat vector but by changing local weather and ecological conditions.</p><p>You just can't go from 2.7 million burned acres in 2010 to 7.2 million acres in 2012, back to 2.7 million acres in 2014, then to 6.7 million acres in 2017, followed by just 3.7 million acres in 2020-and still argue along with the Climate Howlers that the planet is angry.</p><p>To the contrary, the only real trend evident is that on a decadal basis during recent times there is just one place where the average forest fire acreage has been slowly rising-California!</p><p>But that's owing to the above described dismal failure of government forest management policies. Even then, California's mildly rising average fire acreage trend since 1950 is a rounding error compared to the annual averages from prehistoric times, which were nearly 6X greater than during the most recent decade.</p><p>Furthermore, the gently rising trend since 1950, as shown below, should not be confused with the Climate Howlers' bogus claim that California's fires have \"grown more apocalyptic every year,\" as the New York Times reported.</p><p>In fact, the NYT was comparing the above average burn during 2020 versus that of 2019, which saw an unusually small amount of acreage burned. That is, just 280,000 acres in 2019 compared to 1.3 million and 1.6 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 775,000 on average over the last decade.</p><p>Nor is this lack of correlation with global warming just a California and US phenomena. As shown in the chart below, the global extent of fire-causing drought, measured by five levels of severity with dark brown being the most extreme, has shown no worsening trend at all during the past 40 years.</p><p>This brings us to the gravamen of the case. To wit, there is no angry weather signal of impending climate crisis whatsoever. But the AGW hoax has so thoroughly contaminated the mainstream narrative and the policy apparatus in Washington and capitals all around the world that contemporary society was fixing to commit economic Hara Kari-well, until Donald Trump came along vowing to pull the entire Team America off the playing field of global green nonsense.</p><p>And for damn good reason. In contradistinction to the phony case that the rise of fossil fuel use after 1850 has caused the planetary climate system to become unglued, there has been a sharp acceleration of global economic growth and human well-being. And one essential element behind that salutary development has been the massive increase in the use of cheap fossil fuels to power economic life.</p><p>The chart below could not be more dispositive. During the pre-industrial era between 1500 and 1870, global real GDP crawled along at just 0.41% per annum. By contrast, during the past 150 years of the fossil fuel age global GDP growth accelerated to 2.82% per annum-or nearly 7 times faster.</p><p>This higher growth, of course, in part resulted from a larger and far healthier global population made possible by rising living standards. Yet it wasn't human muscle alone that caused the GDP level to go parabolic as per the chart below.</p><p>It was also due to the fantastic mobilization of intellectual capital and technology. And one of the most important vectors of the latter was the ingenuity of the fossil fuel industry in unlocking the massive trove of stored work that Mother Nature extracted, condensed, and salted away from the incoming solar energy over the long warmer and wetter eons of the past 600 million years.</p><p>Needless to say, the curve of world energy consumption tightly matches the rise of global GDP shown above. Thus, in 1860 global energy consumption amounted to 30 exajoules per year and virtually 100% of that was represented by the blue layer labeled \"bio-fuels,\" which is just a polite name for firewood and the decimation of the forests which it entailed.</p><p>Since then, annual energy consumption has increased 18-fold to 550 exajoules (@100 billion barrels of oil equivalent), but 90% of that gain was due to natural gas, coal, and petroleum. The modern world and today's prosperous global economy would simply not exist absent the massive increase in the use of these efficient fuels, meaning that per capita income and living standards would otherwise be only a small fraction of current levels.</p><p>Yes, that dramatic increase in prosperity-generating fossil fuel consumption has given rise to a commensurate increase in CO2 emissions. But as we have indicated, and contrary to the Climate Crisis narrative, CO2 is not a pollutant!</p><p>As we have seen, the correlated increase in CO2 concentrations-from about 290 ppm to 415 ppm since 1850-amounts to a rounding error in both the long trend of history and in terms of atmospheric loadings from natural sources.</p><p>As to the former, CO2 concentrations of less than 1000 ppm are only recent developments of the last ice age, while during prior geologic ages concentrations reached as high as 2400 ppm.</p><p>Likewise, the oceans contain an estimated 37,400 billion tons of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2,000-3,000 billion tons, and the atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 or 20X more than current fossil emissions shown below. Of course, the opposite side of the equation is that oceans, land, and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously so the incremental loadings from human sources is very small.</p><p>More importantly, even a small shift in the balance between oceans and the atmosphere would cause a much more severe rise/fall in CO2 concentrations than anything attributable to human activity. But since the Climate Howlers falsely postulate that the pre-industrial level of 290 parts per million was extant since the Big Bang and that the modest rise since 1850 is a one-way ticket to boiling the planet alive, they obsess over the \"sources versus sinks\" balance in the carbon cycle for no valid reason whatsoever.</p><p>Actually, the continuously shifting carbon balance of the planet over any reasonable period of time is a big, so what!</p><p> - This article appeared at <url normalizedValue=\"https://brownstone.org/articles/wildfires-and-the-hoary-hoax-of-a-burning-planet/\">Brownstone Institute</url> and reposted from Stockman's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.davidstockmanscontracorner.com/wildfires-fried-smelt-and-the-hoary-hoax-of-a-burning-planet/\">personal service</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-469683033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DW7-SBV3-S24J-P48D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 12, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Bismarck this weekend is expected to see temperatures in the mid-90s. That's about 10 degrees warmer than normal for this time of year, but not likely to approach records that are in the triple digits.</p><p>A heat dome that has been baking the West with record temperatures will be shifting eastward. Elevated dew points also could make it humid, according to Megan Jones, a meteorologist in the weather service\u2019s Bismarck office who specializes in climate matters.</p><p>\"Definitely a change from the weather we've been seeing the past couple of weeks,\" she said, noting that people who aren't used to the heat should take precautions. The Weather Service advises people who will be outdoors to wear light, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, apply sunscreen, drink plenty of water and take regular breaks in the shade.</p><p>North Dakota is on the periphery of the Western heat dome and the warmth will be \"nothing too crazy,\" Jones said, though she added that \"It's not out of the question that we could see some highs around 100 in the southwest on Saturday.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, wildfire smoke from Canada is once again moving southward.</p><p>\"It's just based on the upper air pattern -- you've got a flow that's really connecting us to northwest Alberta, where there are a lot of wildfires going on right now,\" Jones said.</p><p>The wildfires in Canada haven't been as extreme as they were last summer, when blazes\u00a0scorched about 45 million acres -- an area about the size of North Dakota.\u00a0The fires that stretched from the western provinces east to Quebec sent smoke south on a regular basis over the summer of 2023, leading to unhealthy air on many occasions.</p><p>Wildfires so far this summer have burned fewer than 3 million acres north of the border,\u00a0according to the\u00a0Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p><p>Much of the smoke expected in North Dakota this week is likely to remain high above the ground, meaning there will be hazy skies, a smoke smell and bright red-orange sunrises and sunsets, but no widespread ground-level health dangers.</p><p>\"Certainly not near as bad as some of the days we had last summer,\" Jones said.</p><p>Air quality in most of the state including Bismarck-Mandan on Tuesday was rated \"moderate,\" though areas in north central North Dakota and just across the U.S.-Canada border were rated \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" according to\u00a0AirNow, a partnership of federal and state agencies including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>Wildfire smoke is particularly dangerous because it contains tiny particulate matter, the tiniest of pollutants. When inhaled, it can move deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. It comes from sources including the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. Such smoke has been linked to several health complications including asthma, heart disease and other respiratory illnesses.</p><p>Information on wildfires and air quality is on the state Department of Environmental Quality website, at\u00a0bit.ly/3OhrD7E.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-10913094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFK-VW81-F039-F0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000057</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX581</classCode><className>BISMARCK, ND, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS150</classCode><className>NORTH DAKOTA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GS167</classCode><className>ALBERTA, CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GS176</classCode><className>QUEBEC, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Over a few hundred years the inhabitants of this remote island quarried, carved and erected around 887 moai.

According to news reporting out of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, by NewsRx editors, research stated, \"Recently, a decrease in insect abundance and diversity has been described, as well as an alteration of the forest fire regime. Due to the sensitivity of butterflies to environmental changes, we studied the richness of butterflies in 2 forests, one affected by fire and the other without signs of fire.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Autonomous University Nuevo Leon, \"By means of transect sampling and butterfly trapping during the 4 seasons of the year, the floristic and butterfly diversity was determined. The analysis of the data obtained showed that the forest with fire had a greater diversity of flowers and butterflies than the control area. Comparing the 2 forests, a dissimilarity of 27% and 41% was confirmed between the species richness of flowers and butterflies, respectively. In addition, a significant variation in the presence of flowers and butterflies was observed throughout the year in the burned area, which was not significant in the control area.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Therefore, it is important to study the effect of forest fires on plant and animal diversity, and to consider their results in forest management plans.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Post-fire Butterfly Diversity In a Pine-oak Forest In Northeast Mexico.

After surviving against the odds and being nursed back to health, the bear was brought to the Smithsonian Museum, where he was given a permanent home. Here, he became the real life Smokey Bear and the nation fell in love with him ever since.</p><p>To help celebrate Smokey's birthday, the Lakeview library is hosting a \"Smokey Bear Summer Reading Challenge,\" where students will be challenged with reading books related to wildfires and learning about forest safety and fire prevention.</p><p>The challenge can be found on the libraries Beanstack app, or at its website, lakeviewarealibrary.org. The challenge will have readers read specific books or complete simple activities. Once all activities are complete, the reader can earn a prize.</p><p>The event kicks off on July 23 with Goddard State Park educator Megan McDowell and, of course, Smokey Bear, coming to help teach kids about wildfire safety.</p><p>McDowell will begin the day with a short educational lesson, and a fire engine from Sandy Lake will be brought in for the kids to see. After that, the kids will participate in a water bucket relay race to put out a fire. Then Smokey will make his appearance riding on a brush truck while kids sing Happy Birthday for him.</p><p>Kids will hear a Smokey Bear book reading and have a photo time with Smokey. Afterward, children will receive a certificate with their name and a goodie bag filled with a comic book, fidget toy, balloon, pins, pens and other information things.</p><p>\"It's important for kids to understand how quickly a brush fire is able to start and spread. Kids often do things because it's fun without thinking of the next step,\" Katelyn Struthers, library director, said. \"Last year, Sandy Lake had a fire start and got pretty big because someone tried to burn cardboard. We want to help kids see the next step.\"</p><p>The challenge will run until Nov. 1 to give kids time to finish after their usual summer reading. Prizes for finishing the challenge have yet to be set, though Struthers, a firefighter with Jackson Center Volunteer Fire Company, said she is hoping to keep the prizes on theme.</p><p>She suggested, though she didn't make a final decision, fire alarms, fire retardant blankets, at home fire extinguishers and a Smokey Bear book as well as gift cards and other small prizes.</p><p>\"This started as just a little program, but we have quickly turned this into something I think kids can be really excited for and have fun,\" Struthers said. \"I hope to keep this energy and fun with our reading challenges and other projects.\"</p><p>Ty Kohler can be contacted at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tkohler@alliednews.com\">tkohler@alliednews.com</email></p><p>___ (c)2024 the Allied News (Grove City, Pa.)

According to news originating from Madhya Pradesh, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"The evolution of drone-based communication has given rise to the Internet of Drones (IoD) paradigm. Drones are currently employed for data collection in diverse monitoring applications such as border security, forest fire management, smart farming, etc.\" </p><p><br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Amity University, \"However, the sharing of data between drones-to-ground stations (D2GS) encounters significant challenges of authentication and confidentiality. To address these issues, various authentication and key-agreement schemes have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, these schemes lack support for aggregate verification of authenticity, leading to increased computational resource consumption at the receiver end. To tackle these challenges, this article contributes a secure and lightweight signcryption scheme with aggregate verification. Subsequently, leveraging this scheme, the article introduces the first efficient and secure data aggregation scheme for IoD-based D2GS communication. This novel approach ensures authentication and confidentiality in a single logical step while supporting aggregate verification of authenticity, thereby minimizing computational resource consumption at the receiver end.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"A comprehensive discussion on security and performance analysis validates the efficiency and suitability of the proposed design for IoD-based D2GS communication.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Efficient and Secure Signcryption-based Data Aggregation for Internet of Drone-based Drone-to-ground Station Communication.
