The university had NSF research expenditures totaling more than $144 million, topping other institutions such as the University of Washington, Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Michigan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The NSF funds bold ideas across multiple disciplines, laying the foundation for future breakthroughs that will impact society. Producing that kind of impact is what inspires and motivates everything we do,\" said UT Austin President Jay Hartzell. \"I'm especially proud of our research teams and research support staff whose incredible work enable us to leverage NSF funds so effectively.\"</p><p>Examples of NSF funding abound on the UT Austin campus. The NSF designated UT Austin as a National Artificial Intelligence Institute in fiscal 2020, competitively awarding professors Adam Klivans, Alex Dimakis and their colleagues in computer science and computer engineering a cooperative agreement to establish the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning. Now a hub for interdisciplinary research, the institute brings together mathematicians, roboticists, data scientists and ethicists to create new classes of algorithms that can lead to more sophisticated and beneficial AI technologies.</p><p>In the Jackson School of Geosciences, Assistant Professor Ashley Matheny won an NSF CAREER grant to support her work studying the lateral transport of water within trees -something that, to date, has been poorly understood. To do this, she's designing sensors that can measure water content at different depths when inserted directly into trees. This information will give scientists a more complete picture of how plants use water, which, in turn, could improve drought and forest fire predictions.</p><p>Moody College of Communication graduate student Anastazja Harris received a doctoral dissertation grant from the NSF to study the role that AI literacy plays in hiring managers' acceptance of artificial intelligence-based screening and interview recommendations. Specifically, she wants to know whether a person's AI understanding - or lack thereof - affects whether that person follows the technology's suggestions or dismisses them. \"It's an important distinction,\" Harris said.</p><p>And NSF awards have also enabled scientists at UT's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) todeployFrontera, the fastest supercomputer at any university in the world. Each year, thousands of researchers and students from across the country use TACC's systems to power data-heavy projects in everything from astronomy and engineering to medicine and manufacturing. Recently, Frontera has made possible leading epidemiological and molecular COVID-19 models in addition to producing real-time emergency storm surge forecasts along the Gulf Coast.</p><p>\"Our leading position in expenditures of NSF funds allows our tremendously accomplished and broad-based cadre of investigators to make major contributions to basic and applied science,\" said Daniel Jaffe, UT's vice president for research. \"These funds, distributed among nearly 600 project teams and campus facilities, enable curiosity-driven, groundbreaking research - the benefits of which will continue to be realized far beyond our lifetimes.\"</p><p>UT Austin also ranked No. 5 in the country in research financed by the Department of Defense and No. 8 in research financed by the Department of Energy.</p><p>The HERD Survey is the primary source of information on research and development expenditures at U.S. colleges and universities and is administered by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.

Indonesia, an archipelagic nation of approximately 17,000 islands with a population of approximately 276 million, is the world's fourth most populous nation. According to Climate Watch, Indonesia is among the world's top emitters of GHGs, ranking fourth in 2019 after China, the United States, and India. Indonesia's government has expressed concern about the effects of climate change on its development, biodiversity, population, and national security. For example, Indonesia's environment minister opened the 2022 G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministers' Meeting by stating that climate change \"would not only wipe out all development progress that has been achieved over the past decades, particularly in emerging economies, but it would also propel us over an environmental tipping point into uncharted territory where no future will be sustainable.\" Congress has expressed interest in Indonesia's commitment and actions to address climate change, which are largely tied to Indonesia's GHG emissions from land and energy use. Congress also may be called upon by some to appropriate funds and conduct oversight of several new U.S. initiatives aimed at supporting Indonesia's efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure 1. Indonesia CO2e Emissions 1990-2019</p><p>Source: Congressional Research Service (CRS) using data from World Resources Institute, Climate Watch Data, Indonesia Profile; and the Indonesian Government's Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 2022.</p><p>Note: MtCO2e represents million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, which represents the number of metric tons of CO2 emissions with the same global warming potential as 1 metric ton of another greenhouse gas. The unconditional NDC target is the emissions reduction goal Indonesia has committed to reach regardless of outside assistance. The conditional NDC target is the emission reduction goal Indonesia has committed to reach upon receipt of foreign aid. NDC targets include LULUCF (see text) in their CO2e emissions values.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</p><p>According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), GHG emissions from energy production and land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) comprise approximately 82% of Indonesia's total emissions (Figure 1). Emissions from energy largely stem from fuel use (approximately 75%, much of which is from coal-generated energy).</p><p>The LULUCF contribution to GHG emissions in Indonesia is tied to deforestation. Indonesia lost approximately 28.6 million hectares (mha) of forest cover from 2001 to 2021, of which 95% is expected to be permanent, according to some scientists. (One hectare equals about 2.5 acres.) The primary driver of forest loss is commodity-driven deforestation derived from large-scale timber and oil palm plantations, according to the WRI. The annual rate of forest cover loss in Indonesia decreased from approximately 2.4 mha in 2016 to 0.84 mha in 2021 (Figure 2). Scientists attribute the lower deforestation rate in part to government policies to prevent deforestation and fires.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Figure 2. Indonesia Tree Cover Loss 2001-2021</p><p>Source: CRS. Data from World Resources Institute, 2022.</p><p>Note: Dotted line is a three-year moving average.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Projected Effects of Climate Change</p><p>According to a February 2022 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Indonesia is likely to experience increasing temperatures, increasing frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events, and increasing duration of heat waves by the 2050s. Other projected conditions in Indonesia include rising sea levels relative to subsiding land, increased salinization of coastal aquifers, increased incidence of waterborne disease, decreased marine fish yields, and increased risk of forest fire. Indonesia has the longest coastline in the world, and many of Indonesia's small, low-lying (less than 10 meters above sea level) islands are threatened with land loss from sea level rise and subsidence by mid-century. Its coastal population is one of the highest in the world, and coastal communities are at increased exposure to flooding events, according to the IPCC. Climate change also may affect food production; a 1 degrees Celsius increase in temperature could significantly reduce rice production and fish stocks in Indonesia.</p><p>Selected Indonesian Policies on Climate Change</p><p>Indonesia is planning and implementing actions to address climate change. In the energy sector, roughly 60% of Indonesia's electricity comes from coal. In 2021, Indonesia pledged not to construct new coal plants; this promise does not affect coal plants already under construction (an estimated additional 13.8 gigawatts of capacity). President Widodo pledged to shut all coal plants by 2056; his second and final term in office is scheduled to end in early 2024.</p><p>At the 2022 G20 Summit, Indonesia, the United States, and several other countries formed a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). The JETP includes a financing package to help Indonesia transition away from coal, increase renewable energy production, and commit to net-zero emissions in its power sector by 2050. Net-zero means Indonesia would emit no more GHG into the atmosphere than it removes. The JETP is expected to invest an initial $20 billion over the next three to five years to accelerate Indonesia's energy transition. An October 2022 Planning Ministry study estimates Indonesia would need between $150 billion and $200 billion per year over the next nine years to reach net-zero emissions by 2060. Under JETP, Indonesia is to reach its peak emissions and increase its renewable energy target to 34% of all power generation by 2030. As part of the partnership, Indonesia pledged to cap carbon dioxide emissions from its power sector at 290 MtCO2e by 2030, down from a baseline of 357 MtCO2e.</p><p>Indonesia also signed an agreement with Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo to preserve the three countries' forests (approximately half of the world's tropical forests). The agreement calls for a funding mechanism to provide payments to reduce deforestation.</p><p>Nationally Determined Contribution</p><p>In September 2022, Indonesia submitted an Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This NDC communicates the country's emission reduction targets and other actions intended to contribute to meeting the collective goals of the Paris Agreement. In its NDC, Indonesia commits to reducing GHG emissions by 31.9% (unconditionally) relative to its business-as-usual (BAU) scenario by 2030 and, conditional upon the receipt of foreign aid, commits to reducing GHG emissions by 43.2% relative to BAU. Figure 1 illustrates these targets compared with Indonesia's historical GHG emissions. (The percentage reductions for unconditional and conditional actions are based on the estimated BAU in 2030.)</p><p>Indonesia's NDC identifies LULUCF - including peat fires - and energy as the two main sectors contributing to its GHG emissions. The NDC specifies a target of restoring 2 mha of peatland and rehabilitating 12 mha of degraded land by 2030 in an effort to reduce emissions. Indonesia plans to continue to implement Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategies to achieve its emission reduction targets. The NDC further identifies specific mitigation efforts in the energy sector.</p><p>Cooperation with the United States</p><p>The United States provides development assistance to Indonesia that focuses in part on promoting sustainable livelihoods, conserving terrestrial and marine resources, and reducing emissions from LULUCF. All of these initiatives address climate change concerns directly or indirectly. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports the Sustainable Environmental Governance Across Regions program, which aims to improve environmental governance and land use practices. In Indonesia by 2026, USAID aims to bring 7 mha of tropical forest and peatland under improved management, reduce 55 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, and mobilize up to $45 million in public and private investments.</p><p>In addition, USAID is planning a new climate partnership with Indonesia to support carbon sequestration in forests and the conservation of biodiversity, including orangutans, elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Other countries also are addressing land-use issues in Indonesia; for example, Norway has agreed to pay Indonesia for keeping selected forests intact.</p><p>In the energy sector, the United States and Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to support Indonesia's plan for low-emissions development. The MOU would allow USAID to share information and exchange knowledge, develop and implement projects, and collaborate on research and activities with Indonesia. (The United States also contributed to the finance deal under the JETP.) In a public-private partnership, ExxonMobil and Indonesian state-owned energy company Pertamina signed a $2.5 billion agreement to develop a carbon capture and sequestration hub in Indonesia.</p><p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC; a U.S. agency that provides grants to countries to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and strengthen institutions) concluded talks with Indonesia in 2021 to launch a $698 million MCC compact with $649 million from the United States and the rest from Indonesia. The MCC implemented an earlier $500 million compact with Indonesia from 2013 to 2018, with over $300 million allocated for efforts to promote green growth - simultaneously fostering economic development and preserving natural resources. The new compact aims to support climate-conscious transportation infrastructure in five provinces, help mobilize international capital in support of Indonesia's development goals, support coal plant decommissioning as part of the JETP, and increase access to finance for Indonesia's women-owned businesses.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The white paper is posted at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12300\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12300</url></p><p>[Category: CRSCRS]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8038475 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8038475</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6789-7BJ1-JC11-10GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1800\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 7, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In Pennsylvania, 99 percent of all wildfires are caused by people.</p><p>\"We encourage people to be mindful when building a bonfire, burning trash, smoking or doing any activity outdoors that could potentially spark a devastating wildfire,\" said Mike Kern, chief of the Division of Forest Fire Protection within DCNR's Bureau of Forestry. \"Please exercise common sense to help limit the threat of wildfires and help ease the burden for the volunteer firefighters who respond to these emergencies.\"</p><p>Certain conditions are necessary for a wildfire to occur:</p><p>An available fuel source, such as dried grass or leaves</p><p>Dry conditions, including low relative humidity</p><p>An ignition source -- some way for the fire to start</p><p>\"With 16.6 million acres of forestland, Pennsylvania has the most abundant hardwood forest in the nation and leads the nation in the production and export of hardwood lumber,\" said Department of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Fred Strathmeyer, Jr. \"Forest products like cabinetry and wood flooring feed $39.1 billion into our state economy annually and support 168,600 jobs across Pennsylvania. A carelessly started wildfire threatens not only a precious natural resource, but our economy and our jobs.\"</p><p>Debris burning, equipment use, power lines, and campfires, are some of the most common causes of wildfires in Pennsylvania. Before building a campfire, utilizing a firepit, or burning debris, residents should consult the local government to learn about any restrictions or ordinances regarding fires.</p><p>Wildfire prevention is a message brought to people across the country by the well-known figure, Smokey Bear.

I understand the necessity of controlled burns in helping mitigate forest fire catastrophes. But despite brutally dry conditions, low humidity and wind advisory/red flag warnings issued the entire week and worse conditions predicted for the coming week, it still was determined to initiate the burn. Soon after the fire was lit, winds swirled and hot embers jumped the fire line and started an uncontained wildfire now threatening several mountain communities - with a potential catastrophic impact on the water supply to Las Vegas.Given the conditions, none of the residents in Gallinas Canyon and the surrounding areas can believe that a controlled burn was authorized. We are now all readying for evacuation, as are the communities of Las Dispensas, Penderies and San Ignacio. </p><p>Another wildfire burning in Southern New Mexico started as a controlled burn. My question to Forest Service officials is this: What kind of guidelines would ever make you think it was OK to start a controlled burn under such conditions during the windiest time of year? Tell us how you evaluate the risk of people losing their homes, livestock and potentially ruining a watershed area that serves as the only source of water to the city of Las Vegas.</p><p>Charlie Paynter</p><p>Montezuma</p><p>Explain, please</p><p>Not interested in personal attacks or specific blaming, but it would be of great interest to know the actual real and true specifics of how a controlled burn is initiated. What criteria are involved? What background and experience in the natural and scientific world are involved? Many questions can lead to a process that is multifaceted, in touch with all aspects of such an important decision, not a bureaucratic tangle or a simple bungle resulting in a shrug. We deserve clarity on this subject.</p><p>Thor Sigstedt</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Beware of thieves</p><p>People in Santa Fe need to know that an organized crime group is stealing exhaust systems off cars throughout the city. Catalytic converters on cars and trucks contain unusual metals that can be sold for money to scrap dealers willing to buy from criminals.</p><p>Car repair shops, car dealers and private parties across Santa Fe have had exhaust systems removed by these criminals. They come with battery-powered reciprocating saws, quickly cut the exhaust pipes and leave. I caught a group of young men cutting the exhaust off my van. They fled in an older brown Chevy Tahoe with no muffler. They did just under $8,000 damage to my van. While we wait for law enforcement to catch the thieves and their metal buyers, everyone needs to keep a close eye on your vehicles. Let's work together to catch these thieves.</p><p>Tom Ribe</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Nation of laws</p><p>Sometimes I'm sorry we're a nation of laws (\"Man accused of raping 6 children, giving them STDs,\" April 10). If we were some rogue country, we could just air-drop this miscreant into some jungle. But we're not. We're a nation of laws. Which doesn't stop me from being resentful that some of my tax dollars go to feeding this guy three meals a day. That's assuming he stays in jail - this is New Mexico after all. So we're a nation of laws, but apparently not of common sense.</p><p>Patricia Emerson</p><p>Santa Fe</p><p>Low-priority education</p><p>As a former teacher, I am utterly dismayed by the news (\"SFPS nixes plans for extended school year,\" April 9) that Santa Fe Public Schools parents and teachers are turning down supplemental school days, a prepaid state offering. Find another way to \"move the academic needle?\" There is no better way to get New Mexico off the low-performing list of states than beefing up curriculum, spending more time on educational tasks and enriching educational experiences for children.

But fire officials reported a successful battle overnight, announcing that crews had contained about 12% of the inferno.</p><p>Fire officials announced at about 6 p.m. Friday that containment had increased to 56%. The burn area remained at 5,208 acres.</p><p>At a mid-morning briefing Thursday, officials said evacuation orders that were issued Wednesday afternoon for the Paradise Ranch Mobile Home park in Gorman were being lifted.</p><p>And early Thursday afternoon, the evacuations of homes along Ridge Route Road were also lifted, while Old Ridge Route Road was reopened between Templin Highway and Northlake Hills Elementary School for \"residential traffic only,\" the sheriff's department reported. Residents were advised to have their identification ready to show officials.</p><p>Seven firefighters suffered heat-related injuries Wednesday while battling the flames in triple-digit heat, but authorities said all seven were released from the hospital and \"doing well.\"</p><p>One home along Ridge Route was destroyed overnight, and a separate outbuilding in a different location was damaged, Angeles National Forest Fire Chief Robert Garcia said. There were no reports of any other injuries.</p><p>\"There was a lot of opportunity with this fire behavior yesterday (Wednesday) for this to go far worse than it did,\" Garcia said. \"So thanks to our partners for keeping the public and our firefighters safe.</p><p>\"The headline for us on the Angeles National Forest is going to be the conditions we're in now,\" he told reporters Thursday morning. \"The fire behavior and what you saw yesterday should be a wake-up call to us all about the potential that we're in and we're entering into over the next few days in terms of the fire conditions. Very rapid fire growth and very, very explosive fire behavior.</p><p>\"And so the message from the Angeles National Forest ... is that the days ahead are going to be very challenging,\" he said. \"So we ask for full cooperation for our public that's visiting the national forest and those that live in and around the national forest, that based on those conditions we please ask you to heed the warnings of our conditions, our fire danger level, and our fire restrictions and of course closures and evacuations should a fire emerge in your area.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, evacuations were ordered north of Northlake Hills Elementary School, south of Templin Highway, east of the Golden State Freeway and west of Castaic Lagoon. The elementary school was evacuated Wednesday, with no injuries to any students or staff.</p><p>Nearby Castaic High School was unaffected, and that campus remained open Thursday.</p><p>Evacuees were advised to head north to escape the fire zone. Frazier Mountain High School in Lebec and West Ranch High School in Santa Clarita were being used as evacuation centers. A Red Cross official said about 40 people took advantage of the centers Wednesday.</p><p>The Castaic Animal Care Shelter was being open to assist evacuees with animals.</p><p>Firefighters in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft worked into the night to take advantage of slightly lower temperatures to begin getting an upper hand against the blaze.</p><p>\"We were very successful in putting a lot of retardant on parts of the fire where we had some challenges,\" Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Tom Ewald said. \"Ground resources were able to get hose lines and hand crews in to re-establish and strengthen some of the lines that were being threatened earlier in the fire.\"</p><p>The aerial attack got a major upgrade Thursday morning with the addition of two Super Scooper aircraft, which arrived in the Southland earlier this week from Canada under an annual contract that puts them in service locally during fire season.</p><p>That contract went into effect Thursday, and the bright yellow Super Scooper aircraft were deployed about 6:30 a.m. Thursday, fire officials said.</p><p>Nine \"heavy lift\" helicopters also were deployed Thursday in the firefighting effort, officials said.</p><p>\"Excessive heat, low humidity and steep terrain will continue to pose the biggest challenge for firefighters today (Thursday),\" fire officials said in an incident update statement. \"This combination has the potential for large plume growth, uphill runs and short-range spotting.\"</p><p>Fire officials said they would be working to keep the fire west of Castaic Lake, east of Palumas Canyon, south of Fall Creek and north of Lake Hughes Road.</p><p>Temperatures in the area were again in the triple-digits, thanks to a heat wave that is expected to continue through the Labor Day weekend and into early next week.</p><p>Shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, the northbound Golden State Freeway was closed at Parker Road, just south of the fire scene, according to the California Highway Patrol. A short time later, flames jumped the northbound freeway lanes and began creeping toward the southbound lanes, prompting a closure of traffic in that direction as well.</p><p>On the northbound Golden State Freeway, two left lanes opened Friday morning north of Lake Hughes Road. Southbound, all lanes were open from Templin Highway to Lake Hughes Road.</p><p>The Castaic Regional Sports Complex was closed Thursday because of the fire. The sports complex could remain closed for the weekend.</p><p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the area, hailed the \"Herculean\" efforts of fire crews braving the heat and difficult terrain to beat back the flames.</p><p>\"Their labor is also a reminder for us all to practice responsible and safe recreation as the Labor Day holiday approaches,\" Barger said in a statement. \"Most wildfires are caused by human carelessness. Campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, playing with fireworks -- all can trigger a blaze. We all need to do our part to keep our communities safe.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-CASTAICBRUSHEREVACUATIONSLIFTASCREWSMAKEPROGRESSAGAINST5208ACRECASTAICBRUSHFIRE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:669D-38S1-DYTF-R0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1071\"/><timeReceived>6:18 PM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 City News Service, Inc.

A Red Cross official said about 40 people took advantage of the centers Wednesday.</p><p>The Castaic Animal Care Shelter was being open to assist evacuees with animals.</p><p>Firefighters in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft worked into the night to take advantage of slightly lower temperatures to begin getting an upper hand against the blaze.</p><p>\"We were very successful in putting a lot of retardant on parts of the fire where we had some challenges,\" Los Angeles County Fire Department Deputy Chief Tom Ewald said. \"Ground resources were able to get hose lines and hand crews in to re-establish and strengthen some of the lines that were being threatened earlier in the fire.\"</p><p>The aerial attack got a major upgrade Thursday morning with the addition of two Super Scooper aircraft, which arrived in the Southland earlier this week from Canada under an annual contract that puts them in service locally during fire season.</p><p>That contract went into effect Thursday, and the bright yellow Super Scooper aircraft were deployed about 6:30 a.m. Thursday, fire officials said.</p><p>Nine \"heavy lift\" helicopters also were deployed Thursday in the firefighting effort, officials said.</p><p>\"Excessive heat, low humidity and steep terrain will continue to pose the biggest challenge for firefighters today (Thursday),\" fire officials said in an incident update statement. \"This combination has the potential for large plume growth, uphill runs and short-range spotting.\"</p><p>Fire officials said they would be working to keep the fire west of Castaic Lake, east of Palumas Canyon, south of Fall Creek and north of Lake Hughes Road.</p><p>Temperatures in the area were again in the triple-digits, thanks to a heat wave that is expected to continue through the weekend.</p><p>Shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, the northbound Golden State Freeway was closed at Parker Road, just south of the fire scene, according to the California Highway Patrol. A short time later, flames jumped the northbound freeway lanes and began creeping toward the southbound lanes, prompting a closure of traffic in that direction as well.</p><p>All lanes of the northbound Golden State Freeway were reopened at 1:30 a.m. Thursday, but by later Thursday morning, only one lane was accessible. According to the CHP, Caltrans crews were assessing the structural integrity of one stretch of the northbound freeway, so the roadway was reduced to one lane.</p><p>On the southbound freeway, only two lanes were open Thursday morning.</p><p>The Castaic Regional Sports Complex was closed Thursday because of the fire. The sports complex could remain closed for the weekend.</p><p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the area, hailed the \"Herculean\" efforts of fire crews braving the heat and difficult terrain to beat back the flames.</p><p>\"Their labor is also a reminder for us all to practice responsible and safe recreation as the Labor Day holiday approaches,\" Barger said in a statement. \"Most wildfires are caused by human carelessness. Campfires, discarding lit cigarettes, playing with fireworks -- all can trigger a blaze. We all need to do our part to keep our communities safe.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNS-CASTAICBRUSHEREVACUATIONSLIFTASCREWSMAKEPROGRESSAGAINST5208ACRECASTAICBRUSHFIRE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6696-42T1-JCBD-1065-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><timeReceived>9:57 PM PST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 City News Service, Inc.

Our mission is to make electricity networks greener. TS achieves that through a combination of energy efficiency and faster and cheaper renewable integration,\" said Dr. Jason Huang, CEO at TS Conductor Corp.</p><p>While the electricity generation segment of the energy industry has progressed to cleaner and more efficient solutions, the overhead conductor technology used by transmission and distribution grid operators has not materially changed since the emergence of Aluminum Core Steel Reinforced (ACSR) cables in 1908. ACSR still today represents over 95 percent of the utility cables deployed across the world.</p><p>\"Transmission is fundamentally important to our climate mission, yet it has seen limited innovation over the years. It is rare to find a transmission technology like TS Conductor with as much potential in terms of deployability, cost and efficiency,\" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. \"TS Conductor will be a major enabler of increasing electricity demand and increasing penetration of renewables in a critical time. We are delighted to lead this round with a stand-out team and an outstanding technology.\"</p><p>\"National Grid has committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 90 percent by 2040 and to net zero by 2050, and to accelerating the incorporation of wind, solar and battery storage in our grids in the UK and North America,\" said Lisa Lambert, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of National Grid and the President and Founder of National Grid Partners. \"There are few solutions enabling grid operators to reduce their electricity consumption, and TS Conductor is the most impressive solution I have encountered so far to decarbonize electricity grids. Their product, when combined with a top-notch management team, positions TS Conductor to be a leader in the market.\"</p><p>TS Conductor was founded in 2018 by Rulong Chen, James Huang and Jason Huang, based on James Huang's patented conductor design. This new class of conductors is based on a unique combination of carbon composite and aluminum encapsulation of the composite core. The conductors can be installed with the same tools and operating procedures as ACSR cables. And they are compatible with industry standard field practice and can be used for:</p><p>-Line reconductoring, allowing for the doubling of capacity of an existing line without having to change or retrofit any structures.</p><p>-Energy efficiency upgrades, reducing technical line losses by half without having to change or retrofit any structures.</p><p>-Insulation upgrades of distribution networks, reducing forest fire risks without having to change the poles or towers.</p><p>-Building new lines with lower structure costs and/or better characteristics (in capacity, efficiency, insulation).</p><p>More Information:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tsconductor.com\">http://www.tsconductor.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.breakthroughenergy.org\">http://www.breakthroughenergy.org</url></p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCCLPM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:644W-9NW1-F06S-P1HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Close-Up Media, Inc.

The VFA Program, which is administered by the Department of Conservation and Recreation, is a competitive grant program offered to non-profit rural call, or volunteer fire departments that serve a community with a population of 10,000 or less. The VFA grants are designed to assist municipalities that are home to community volunteer fire departments to respond to wildfires safely and effectively. The funding provided by these grants assist fire departments in training and prevention efforts, as well as the purchasing of necessary supplies and new equipment that enhance their ability to protect forest resources across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program provides valuable funding that aids the Commonwealth's local call and volunteer fire departments throughout Massachusetts,\" said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Beth Card. \"The Baker-Polito Administration is committed to supporting our local public safety crews and understands how important this support is, especially in small, rural areas where resources can serve as a lifeline by enabling training opportunities and the purchasing of necessary emergency fire equipment. \"</p><p>The VFA Program is authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and administered by DCR on a 50 percent reimbursement basis (reimbursement amounts provide a maximum of $3,000 per community). As the largest landowner in Massachusetts, it is DCR's mission to partner with municipalities to protect the state's forests and open spaces.</p><p>\"The Department of Conservation and Recreation relies on partnerships with municipalities to protect our state's forests and open spaces and keep residents and visitors safe,\" said DCR Acting Commissioner Stephanie Cooper. \"The VFA Program grants are a great way to demonstrate our appreciation of our local fire departments as they work to prevent and management fires, as well as safeguarding the public, important infrastructure, and our natural resources.\"</p><p>To be considered for a VFA grant fire departments must be made up of at least 80 percent call or volunteer firefighters, be a state recognized fire department, and must be National Incident Management System (NIMS) compliant. Eligible projects include firefighter safety, technology transfer, and rural fire defense. Priority is given to projects where at least 25 percent of funding will be used for training. Communities considered for a VFA grant in Massachusetts include high-risk towns adjacent to federal lands, those working in partnership with federal firefighting agencies to respond to wildfires, and those in high-risk areas not associated with federal lands.</p><p>\"Local call and volunteer fire departments are critical to the efforts to respond to fire incidents quickly and effectively, and to protect citizens and stop fires from spreading through forests and open spaces,\" said DCR Chief Fire Warden Dave Celino. \"I want to commend town chiefs and forest wardens for their invaluable commitment to their communities, and we are proud to support them in this small way.\"</p><p>\"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program grants will give the brave volunteers at fire departments the resources they need to protect our communities and preserve our forests and open spaces,\" said Senator Eric P. Lesser (D-Longmeadow). \"The efforts of these volunteers are crucial for the well-being of communities throughout the Commonwealth, such as Hampden. I am honored to support them and their important work with these grants.\"</p><p>\"Our local volunteer fire departments are always there when we need them,\" said Representative Todd Smola (R-Warren). \"These grants demonstrate how grateful we are for their dedicated service.\"</p><p>\"Living in a small town means relying on neighbors to volunteer their time to keep our communities functioning smoothly. These dedicated volunteers are often scrambling for the funding and equipment they need,\" said Representative Paul W. Mark (D-Peru). \"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Grant program was set up to help steer resources where they are most needed and I am glad to see so many grants being awarded to towns throughout rural WesternMassachusetts.\"</p><p>\"As many of our less populated towns have so much forest, these grants will help tremendously in protecting property and more importantly life,\" said Representative Susannah Whipps (I-Athol). \"I'm grateful to the US Forest Service and the Baker Administration for this assistance.\"</p><p>\"These grants will provide our volunteer fire departments with additional funding to update their equipment and specialized training for wildfire response and containment,\" said Representative John Barrett III (D-North Adams).</p><p>To learn more about the Volunteer Fire Assistance Program, please visit DCR's Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry webpage (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/service-details/volunteer-fire-assistance-vfa-program\">https://www.mass.gov/service-details/volunteer-fire-assistance-vfa-program</url>) regarding the program.</p><p>* * *</p><p>View table here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-awards-90k-in-grants-to-rural-and-volunteer-fire-departments-across-the-state\">https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-awards-90k-in-grants-to-rural-and-volunteer-fire-departments-across-the-state</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-awards-90k-in-grants-to-rural-and-volunteer-fire-departments-across-the-state\">https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-awards-90k-in-grants-to-rural-and-volunteer-fire-departments-across-the-state</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7865101 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7865101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PJ-WH31-JC11-14V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 16, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The so-called zero-bail schedule has been a controversial issue around the country, with criminal justice reform advocates arguing that pretrial releases should be based on an individual's criminal history not on an arbitrary dollar amount.</p><p>Under the new schedule, almost all defendants accused of nonviolent felonies or misdemeanors in L.A.

'As we believe that freedom of speech as a universal human right and liberty is under threat in Slovenia today, the Council for the Protection of Freedom of Speech is hereby established,' the Council said at the time of its establishment. Jo\u017ee Bi\u0161cak, deputy editor of Demokracija magazine, became the Council's chairman.</p><p>The Slovenian Council for the Protection of Freedom of Speech believes that the current government is increasingly restricting freedom of speech. The latest case, where the government's Agency for Communications Networks and Services (AKOS) demanded the withdrawal of a programme on TV3 under threat of force and fines because a guest on the programme criticised the Speaker of the National Assembly, who is a member of the ruling coalition, shows that the centre-left government is not tolerant of dissenting opinions and criticism. That is why the main task of the Slovenian Council for the Protection of Freedom of Speech will be to work to protect freedom of speech \u2014 so that everyone can express their views publicly without suffering negative consequences, such as the threat of violence or imprisonment, for the things they say. The Council will respond to violations of freedom of speech as a fundamental human right and liberty.</p><p>The Slovenian Council for the Protection of Freedom of Speech will be an open group that expects its supporters and members to work for freedom of speech and never to restrict the freedom of speech of others because of their different views.</p><p>The President Jo\u017ee Bi\u0161cak stated: ' I never imagined that under the current left-wing government, times would be so bad for freedom of speech. The imprisonment for satire (glosses), the numerous denunciations and interrogations for what was said or written, the persecution and harassment of journalists and editors, the state ordering Nova24TV and TV3 to cut out a part of a TV report, the threats of Prime Minister Robert Golob to close down some media \u2014 all this is heading towards dictatorship. It does not bode well for freedom of speech in the future either. Although it is a constitutionally protected right, it needs to be further protected against abuses by the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. That is why the Council for the Protection of Freedom of Speech has been established.

He derided her using the terms 'fat lesbian' and criticized her journalistic efforts, insinuating her advocacy in the LGBTQ+ community made her 'unhinged,' as reported by the Swiss broadcaster RTS.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2023/10/03/uk-to-ban-transgender-biological-men-from-female-hospital-wards-and-prevent-sex-offenders-from-changing-gender/\">UK to Ban Trans Biological Males From Female Hospital Wards and Prevent Sex Offenders From Changing Gender</url></p><p>The British government will reportedly ban transgender individuals from female hospital wards and prevent convicted sex offenders from changing their gender as the struggling Conservative Party looks to throw some red meat to the base before the next general election.</p><p>The Tory Party conference in Manchester will reportedly see top members of Rishi Sunak's government announce crackdowns on the excesses of the transgenderism movement, as the government continues to fail on the two main issues concerning the voter base, cutting the seven-decade-high tax rate and cutting both legal and illegal immigration.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thepostmillennial.com/womens-rights-talk-cancelled-by-british-columbia-community-centre-for-promoting-discrimination-contempt-or-hatred-against-trans-people\">Women's Rights Talk Cancelled by British Columbia Community Centre for 'Promoting Discrimination, Contempt, or Hatred' Against Trans People</url></p><p>Women's rights activist Meghan Murphy was slated to hold an event at the Cowichan Community Centre in Duncan, British Columbia on Wednesday. But after pressure from far-left trans activists, the venue cancelled the event, claiming the purpose of the talk was in 'promoting discrimination, contempt, or hatred' against people who identify as transgender.</p><p>Murphy, whose event in Ladysmith on Sunday sold out, slammed the CCC over its decision, accusing administrators of discriminating against her and those who stand up for the rights of women in Canada. Murphy is an outspoken Canadian woman who stands up for the rights of women and girls to have sex-segregated spaces. She also speaks against the inclusion of males who claim to be women among natural born women. Her account was banned from Twitter in 2018 after she identified a trans-identified male who demanded that female aestheticians wax his testicles as 'him.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXGV-GATE100988169639301135925876100034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">100988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699V-0981-JCMN-Y4F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484246</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"10683\"/><timeReceived>4:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Gates of Vienna</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 4, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

When high winds came into contact with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.</p><p>The fire has burned at least 31 square miles (80 square kilometers) and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated portions of Plumas, Lassen and Sierra County, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.</p><p>Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures.</p><p>At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTE-3b4b774ca68c231cddddb521efa62a6020200816</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KY-J4M1-JC5B-G03Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><timeReceived>10:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The VFA Program, which is administered by the Department of Conservation and Recreation, is a competitive grant program offered to non-profit rural call, or volunteer fire departments that serve a community with a population of 10,000 or less. The VFA grants are designed to assist municipalities that are home to community volunteer fire departments to respond to wildfires safely and effectively. The funding provided by these grants assist fire departments in training and prevention efforts, as well as the purchasing of necessary supplies and new equipment that enhance their ability to protect forest resources across the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program provides valuable funding that aids the Commonwealth's local call and volunteer fire departments throughout Massachusetts,\" said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Beth Card. \"The Baker-Polito Administration is committed to supporting our local public safety crews and understands how important this support is, especially in small, rural areas where resources can serve as a lifeline by enabling training opportunities and the purchasing of necessary emergency fire equipment. \"</p><p>The VFA Program is authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and administered by DCR on a 50 percent reimbursement basis (reimbursement amounts provide a maximum of $3,000 per community). As the largest landowner in Massachusetts, it is DCR's mission to partner with municipalities to protect the state's forests and open spaces.</p><p>\"The Department of Conservation and Recreation relies on partnerships with municipalities to protect our state's forests and open spaces and keep residents and visitors safe,\" said DCR Acting Commissioner Stephanie Cooper. \"The VFA Program grants are a great way to demonstrate our appreciation of our local fire departments as they work to prevent and management fires, as well as safeguarding the public, important infrastructure, and our natural resources.\"</p><p>To be considered for a VFA grant fire departments must be made up of at least 80 percent call or volunteer firefighters, be a state recognized fire department, and must be National Incident Management System (NIMS) compliant. Eligible projects include firefighter safety, technology transfer, and rural fire defense. Priority is given to projects where at least 25 percent of funding will be used for training. Communities considered for a VFA grant in Massachusetts include high-risk towns adjacent to federal lands, those working in partnership with federal firefighting agencies to respond to wildfires, and those in high-risk areas not associated with federal lands.</p><p>\"Local call and volunteer fire departments are critical to the efforts to respond to fire incidents quickly and effectively, and to protect citizens and stop fires from spreading through forests and open spaces,\" said DCR Chief Fire Warden Dave Celino. \"I want to commend town chiefs and forest wardens for their invaluable commitment to their communities, and we are proud to support them in this small way.\"</p><p>Towns that received an award from this year's program are:</p><p>Scroll left</p><p>Scroll right</p><p>TownAward AmountTownAmount</p><p>Adams$1,124Otis$3,000</p><p>Barre$3,000Peru$3,000</p><p>Berkley$3,000Plainfield$2,750</p><p>Boxford$2,832Rutland$3,000</p><p>Brimfield$2,985Shelburne$3,000</p><p>Brookfield$1,440South Deerfield$2,872</p><p>Clarksburg$3,000Sunderland$2,994</p><p>Conway$3,000Sutton$3,000</p><p>Dalton$3,000Tisbury$3,000</p><p>Dunstable$2,488Upton$3,000</p><p>Edgartown$3,000Wales$2,913</p><p>Erving$2,962West Barnstable$2,914</p><p>Hampden$680Westhampton$2,525</p><p>Hawley$1,130Whatley$2,877</p><p>Lee$2,651Williamsburg$3,000</p><p>Montgomery$1,015Williamstown$2,789</p><p>New Braintree$3,000Windsor$1,700</p><p>North Brookfield$1,035</p><p>\"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program grants will give the brave volunteers at fire departments the resources they need to protect our communities and preserve our forests and open spaces,\" said Senator Eric P. Lesser (D-Longmeadow). \"The efforts of these volunteers are crucial for the well-being of communities throughout the Commonwealth, such as Hampden. I am honored to support them and their important work with these grants.\"</p><p>\"Our local volunteer fire departments are always there when we need them,\" said Representative Todd Smola (R-Warren). \"These grants demonstrate how grateful we are for their dedicated service.\"</p><p>\"Living in a small town means relying on neighbors to volunteer their time to keep our communities functioning smoothly. These dedicated volunteers are often scrambling for the funding and equipment they need,\" said Representative Paul W. Mark (D-Peru). \"The Volunteer Fire Assistance Grant program was set up to help steer resources where they are most needed and I am glad to see so many grants being awarded to towns throughout rural WesternMassachusetts.\"</p><p>\"As many of our less populated towns have so much forest, these grants will help tremendously in protecting property and more importantly life,\" said Representative Susannah Whipps (I-Athol). \"I'm grateful to the US Forest Service and the Baker Administration for this assistance.\"</p><p>\"These grants will provide our volunteer fire departments with additional funding to update their equipment and specialized training for wildfire response and containment,\" said Representative John Barrett III (D-North Adams).</p><p>To learn more about the Volunteer Fire Assistance Program, please visit DCR's Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry webpage regarding the program.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1125279099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65PH-D6W1-DYTH-G29S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 15, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Of the seven charges filed by the petitioners, Roberts initially dismissed six, but allowed one to go forward \"more narrowly than alleged.\"</p><p>Durkan asked Roberts to reconsider. Roberts declined.</p><p>Now Durkan is asking the state's highest court to weigh in. Her notice of appeal, filed Wednesday, contains no new arguments. It only asks the Supreme Court to reconsider Roberts' decision.</p><p>Roberts' role is to assume the charges, as filed against Durkan, are true, and to determine whether they're both specific and serious enough to allow the petition to proceed. The charge she allowed to go forward alleges Durkan failed to implement new policing policies after tear gas and other chemical agents were used on protesters. It accuses her of \"misfeasance, malfeasance and violation of the oath of office.\"</p><p>Durkan has argued that it's the chief of police's job to dictate Seattle Police Department policies and, that even if it was her job, changing police policies without court approval would violate the city's longstanding consent decree.</p><p>Fire crew isolated after member's positive test</p><p>BOISE - A wildland firefighter who was working with about 270 other people on a small fire in Idaho has tested positive for coronavirus, officials said Wednesday.</p><p>The Idaho Department of Lands said in a news release that the person who tested positive and those who were working with the individual were isolated and returned to their home unit without interacting with other fire crews or nearby communities.

State and federal agencies are working on suppressing the blaze, which was started by lightning on Aug. 6.</p><p>State and federal wildland firefighting agencies have taken several steps in hopes of reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, including having crews camp separately, using air drops to deliver meals and having staffers wear masks when they can't maintain social distancing.</p><p>So far, more than 25,500 people in Idaho have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. But that number is likely an undercount because not everyone is tested.

Lincoln officials announced the move to the higher rating Monday, as weather forecasters said more hot, dry weather was on tap for the region this week. Forest officials say despite it being late October, multiple fires larger than 1.5 square miles have cropped up in the past week, including the Luna Fire in northern New Mexico and the Horse Fire south of Prescott, Ariz. \"We are seeing similar trends to what we saw in 2011 when we had several fires over the winter,\" Lincoln National Forest Fire Staff Officer David Bales said in a statement. \"To be moving into a very high fire danger rating so late in the year is atypical but based on the low fuel moisture levels and activity in the region, it's warranted.\" While there are no fire restrictions on the Lincoln forest, officials are asking the public to be careful and to not burn on red flag days. Data from the Agriculture Department's statistics service shows there were no reports of precipitation during the past week in New Mexico, and average high temperatures in the state remained 6 to 12 degrees above average for this time of year. -- Associated Press</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61B1-F3D1-F0YC-P35N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"218\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Environment and Energy Publishing, LLC</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 21, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Already unbearably hot, the stretch from August to October is typically known as California's burning season; however, the deadly combination of dry air and extreme heat have caused the current unprecedented forest fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are a certain amount of preventative fires done by professional firefighters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, there is also a rich history of ceremonial burnings done by indigenous people during this season that have been outlawed. The general action plan with forest fires is to prevent and contain them, which has proven difficult in the ongoing current waves of fires. Since the heat waves in late August of this year, over 3.7 million acres of land have been burned, with 26\u00a0 civilian casualties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the California Fire department, a large portion of this fire is located in Santa Rosa, which includes areas of California's wine country that the months of dry weather have morphed into acres of tinder. The fires have increased the humidity in the surrounding areas by approximately 10 degrees.</p><p>The rest of California is still experiencing temperatures as high as 114 degrees, as well as the increasing air pollution and the orange tint of the sky. With a population of nearly 40 million people living in California, a quarter of the population lives in Los Angeles, which has experienced some of the worst wealth disparities in our country, leaving the homeless fighting for shade to escape the scalding heat.</p><p>In southern California, the beautiful beaches of Malibu are burning while the tenement districts in Westlake are lined with melting concrete and ruined housing. These fires are disproportionately affecting the lower-class residents of California, who are effectively dismissed and outcast by the celebrities who are able to afford the residences and better able to escape the scorching heat and oncoming fires. Yet there have always been fires in these areas, and Malibu is the recurrent forest fire capital of the United States. In addition, climate change has exacerbated these blazes; not to mention the constantly growing population in California. This region is prone to naturally occurring forest fires that prolonged heat and dry climates quickly ignite into flames. Californians have long withstood and have witnessed many recorded burnings over time and are emblematic in U.S. history. However, in the last 100 years, these burnings have increased exponentially with rampant air pollution and the increasing population of the state.</p><p>The Washington Post found that \"California's frequency of fall days with extreme fire-weather conditions has already more than doubled since the 1980s.\"\u00a0 While this year's rainfall in California was 50 percent lower than previous years leading to average fire-safe areas, the damp and cooler regions have yet to witness an increase in charred bark and small spontaneous fires.</p><p>Nevertheless, there have been benefits to having billionaires owning land in Malibu, spending thousands of dollars on taxes and insurance policies while the urban poor residents face bad housing standards and landlords who are \"too cheap\" to apply proper safety protocols for low-income residents.</p><p>Mike Davis' \"The Case For Letting Malibu Burn\" dives into detail about the disparities of Californian populations and makes a connection to the frequent burnings and the potential dangers in the region. Davis also denotes the new nature of these fires and how they are separate from California's natural fires. Davis is among many others who have studied the Californian forest fires epidemic and prioritizes the indigenous people of the area and how they had protected themselves throughout California's early history. The Karuk, an indigenous group, have a rich history of preventative ceremonial fires which have been outlawed by the National Forest System during the 1850s when the Karuk were being actively persecuted until the 1930s. Although the NFS was acting in the pursuit of fire suppression, they unknowingly prevented a fire and dismissed the indigenous preventative measures of forest fires. The Karuk tribe has had sovereign land in California (not reservation land, but their own tribal land) where they have been continuing their traditional burnings. Most importantly, the Karuk have addressed their concerns to the NFS that today, most environmentalists accept as a dire need and a natural method for preventative fires before peak season.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Karuk continue to be hard-pressed by the \"proper clearance\" of forests and the insufficient number of firefighters to oversee the overwhelming burnings-these are smaller-scale fires, used to clear bushes and dead plants which are bound to spark during California's dry season each year.</p><p>Presently, the Karuk are unsettled by the hurdles they have to face daily from the federal government when they are working to prevent millions of dollars worth of damages and avoid preventable deaths in the first place. Other indigenous groups facing similar hurdles include the Yurok, Karuk, Hupa, Miwok, and Chumash, who are among hundreds of indigenous groups across California. Ultimately, these indigenous groups understand the medicinal need for fire for intentional burns that do wonders for regrowth and sustainability in the regions with controlled burns and have proven to prevent large scale and uncontrolled fires.</p><p>The most illuminating aspect of the current forest fires plaguing California is that these fires and the continuing sparks are completely preventable. In El Dorado, a family set off a \"pyrotechnic\" device as a means to reveal the gender of their unborn baby. This caused over 7,000 acres to burn in the city and was only added recently to the current fires being fought. The family has not yet been charged, as the extent of the damages are still unknown (beyond the fact that it took approximately 600 firefighters to fight this fire with at least one residential structure completely destroyed). Even so, this was not the first gender reveal party to end in millions of dollars worth of property damage, and it is unlikely that this will be the last considering how climate change has been increasingly affecting California.</p><p>Comedian Drew Gooden concludes the cause of the El Dorado fire by saying, \"Only you care about the gender of your baby, please put down the explosive device!\".</p><p>QR Code for Davis' Essay \"The Case for Letting Malibu Burn\"</p><p>Editor's Note</p><p>As you read this article, there is an important distinction between \"wildfire(s)\" and \"forest fire(s).\" Apparently, the term \"forest fire(s)\" was eventually replaced with \"wildfire(s)\" by \"professional firefighters\" in the United States. This could indicate a type of erasure in other cultures, specifically indigenous groups and their connection to nature and the Californian forests. The Scarlet wants to maintain this connection and acknowledges the traditions of the past from indeginous groups that have worked hard and have been marginalized, people who continue to work to provide a pre-existing solution to the plaguing fires. Let this story inform these issues and raise awareness to the blatant disregard for others and their voices.</p><p>Luis Santos, News Editor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4770727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-HP61-DY7P-T00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Scarlet: Clark University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Worcester</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>MA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

One was a woman in a red baseball cap, the front crown emblazoned with a declarative sentence: \"Trump won.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No, he didn't. Only those who have abandoned all critical thinking continue attacking Biden as a vote thief and portraying former President Donald Trump as the victim of a political coup.</p><p>Trump, bitter loser that he is, tried to persuade election officials in Georgia to switch almost 12,000 votes in his favor, a felony scheme if ever one existed. And it was Trump who sat idly for hours as his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol in hopes of toppling democracy.</p><p>Biden, 79, is accustomed to receiving bizarre criticisms after 50 years in professional politics. But another sign of protest outside the state Capitol provided a juxtaposition that might have jarred the president if he had seen it.</p><p>Only 50 paces from the woman in the red cap was a mobile billboard paid for by three environmental groups. They ripped Biden for failing to keep his word, and for being too tight with the oil and gas industry.</p><p>\"No more drilling on federal lands. Biden keep your promise,\" read flashing images on the billboard. It was affixed to the side of a truck that looped around the Capitol.</p><p>Taylor McKinnon, of the Center for Biological Diversity, traveled from Flagstaff, Ariz., to Santa Fe to express his displeasure with Biden.</p><p>\"On the campaign trail, he promised to end federal oil and gas leasing onshore and offshore,\" McKinnon said as he stood near the billboard. \"Biden issued more permits to drill in his first year than Trump did. While the fires are still burning in New Mexico, the Biden administration will issue more leases that worsen the climate situation.\"</p><p>Biden is sensitive to those criticisms. His press office in early spring produced what it called a fact sheet to counter jabs from environmental groups disappointed in Biden's performance.</p><p>\"President Biden has prioritized expanding clean energy technologies as part of his historic efforts to tackle the climate crisis - all while helping American families lower their energy costs and creating good-paying, union jobs,\" it said.</p><p>With gasoline prices hitting record highs, Biden's administration last month announced it would cancel three sales of oil and gas leases scheduled in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska.</p><p>Millions of acres no longer are candidates for drilling. But Biden's pullback was based on supply and demand. It didn't mollify conservation groups that feel betrayed.</p><p>Along with the Center for Biological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians and Friends of the Earth created the mobile billboard blasting Biden as a flip-flopper.</p><p>On most days, those groups agree on nothing with the conservative crowd that milled on the Capitol lawn, some waving American flags, many complaining about state and federal government regulations.</p><p>The common denominator Saturday was both wings of the political spectrum were unhappy with Biden.</p><p>Other demonstrators from Indigenous organizations gathered across town, near an emergency center where Biden would be briefed on wildfires in New Mexico. The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for much of the destruction.</p><p>Prescribed burns by the agency were supposed to lessen the risk of forest fire. Driven by fierce winds, the fires instead raced out of control. They have burned some 500 square miles and caused untold human suffering through evacuations and destruction of homes.</p><p>Six weeks of relentless fire was just one reason the Indigenous demonstrators mobilized for Biden's stop in New Mexico.</p><p>\"There's climate catastrophe happening,\" said Julia Bernal, executive director of Albuquerque-based Pueblo Action Alliance, another one of the groups unhappy with Biden. \"Not holding the oil and gas industries accountable for greenhouse gas emissions is contributing to the climate crisis.\"</p><p>Biden's can't seem to win, except he did win when the Democratic Party faced the possibility of Trump being reelected.</p><p>To date, Biden's greatest accomplishment is saving a nation from another four years of Trump, who somehow maintained a political base after kowtowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>That sad part for America and for Biden is that he didn't run for president in 2016. He would have trounced Trump in that election. In turn, Trump's corruption would have been restricted to his business deals.</p><p>The Democrats, bound to blind faith and political dynasties, nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016. She had just as many negatives as Trump.</p><p>Clinton was the wrong choice for the Democratic Party but the right matchup for Trump.</p><p>Clinton became the first Democratic presidential nominee to lose Michigan and Pennsylvania since 1988. Those two states were key in providing Trump with his victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote, which became a meaningless statistic.</p><p>Biden probably became president four years too late to do his best work. He's not as quick or convincing as he once was.</p><p>He's also not Trump. That's reason for hope in a fiery season of discontent.</p><p>Ringside Seat is an opinion column about people, politics and news.

State coach Wes Moore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A season ago, she was an All-Big Ten selection at Rutgers. Now, she\u2019s coming off the bench for No. 5 N.C. State.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nice when you can bring Diamond Johnson in to give you a spark,\u201d he said. \u201cShe can give you more than a spark \u2014 she gives you a forest fire out there.\u201d</p><p>Johnson scored 16 points and had six rebounds for N.C. State, which led wire-to-wire in a commanding 100-52 victory over Towson on Monday night.</p><p>Johnson also had three assists and two steals. Four other players for the Wolfpack (3-1) scored in double digits: Elissa Cunane with 15 points, Raina Perez with 13 points, Jakia Brown-Turner with 11 and Camille Hobby with 12.</p><p>Madison Hayes, a transfer from Mississippi State, had career highs in rebounds (12) and assists (6) for N.C. State.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really active,\u201d Hobby said. \u201cShe works really hard. So, when you work hard and you have a great attitude, and you crash the boards really hard, you\u2019re going to get rebounds. That\u2019s what she does.\u201d</p><p>The Wolfpack were dominant in nearly all facets of the game. They shot 55.9% from the floor, 50% from behind the arc and 73.7% from the charity stripe.</p><p>Aleah Nelson paced the Tigers (3-1) with 17 points.</p><p>Towson struggled mightily from 3-point range, making just 3-of-31 shots from deep. The Tigers also had 13 turnovers to just three assists.</p><p>BIG PICTURE</p><p>N.C. State: Johnson was the prized addition this offseason. After struggling in the season-opener against No. 1 South Carolina, the former All-Big Ten selection shined against Towson, showing she could be a real difference-maker.

That's the theme of recent reports linking inflation to state-level tax rebates and other payments to households. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, at least 20 states have sent money to their residents or will do so soon, typically billing the checks as economic stimulus or, more recently, relief for rising energy and food costs. Some knee-jerk critics say that's inflationary, but is it really?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, probably not significantly, for two reasons. One reason comes from better understanding what actually causes inflation; the other is a simple logical analysis of the facts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are three basic causes of inflation, which is an increase in the general price level, not just the price of a single good or service. Inflation can result from an increase in the money supply without economic growth, which is \"monetary\" inflation. Or it can come from total demand for goods and services exceeding supply, which is either \"cost-push\" or \"demand-pull\" inflation: too much money chasing too few goods or too few goods to meet demand without prices increasing.</p><p>Taking them one at a time: (1) States do not print currency or control the money supply. (2) All that supply chain talk you hear is about the cost-push dimension of today's inflation, and that has almost nothing to do with these state payouts. The government services that states provide to their economies are usually priced at zero except for user fees, which are incidental and immaterial in the big picture. There is no inflation when the price is zero. (3) So it's only the demand-pull kind of inflation that state disbursements could ever possibly impact. Otherwise this issue is just political and ideological posturing.</p><p>Dollars In, Dollars Out</p><p>As to the facts, all of the states except for one (Vermont) operate under some kind of balanced-budget requirement. They can't and don't borrow money to fund handouts. Every dollar going out for spending must have a dollar coming in from revenues. The states are typically incapable of increasing what's called aggregate demand, the sum of all money spent in the economy by consumers, governments and businesses. In short, states simply shuffle money around; they don't create it.</p><p>Although in some special cases the injection of cash from state capitols to households could have the ultimate effect of stimulating aggregate demand by consumers, most of that money would have found its way into the local and national economies anyway through government spending by the same states. Only the states' cash payments that would otherwise have gone into rainy-day reserve funds, bond prepayments and supplemental retirement fund contributions would actually be inflationary on a macroeconomic level. None of these states have funded their check-writing by borrowing money that's created out of thin air by the central bank \u2014 as does the federal government \u2014 so the political argument here is about apples and oranges at the very outset. But that cold water of reality didn't stop the recent chatter about state-induced inflation as elections approached.</p><p>Then there is the matter of timing. Some of these payment programs were initiated during the pandemic period as economic lifelines to their citizenry, similar to the first round of federal checks back during the Trump presidency. Those payments were clearly counter-cyclical stimulus payments that largely offset household income losses when the economy had shrunk, as businesses were shuttered by lockdowns and people were staying home rather than spending locally or traveling. Although some of that pandemic-relief cash was saved until this year and not spent before inflation kicked up, most of it was long gone by last Thanksgiving and had almost nothing to do with the alarming price increases we've seen in the past 12 months.</p><p>Next, there are the distributions of cash that went from state treasuries to taxpayers because their laws put a cap on tax revenues and require a rebate. Those dollars are almost by definition non-inflationary, because it's simply squaring out the books in the national income accounts. Again, it's money that the states themselves have shuffled, not spent. Although some can rightfully argue that these rebates were essentially a reduction in tax collections (which is stimulative, hence injecting aggregate demand), they were not a tax cut but a tax cap. That's a distinction with a difference. Those states have all collected \u2014 and kept \u2014 more dollars in taxes than they had the year before. Ultimately, their tax-cap rebate money simply moved the leftovers from taxpayers' left pockets to their right pockets. So it's hard to get too excited about tax-cap distributions being inflationary.</p><p>A close cousin of the tax rebates and tax caps is the handful of states that cut their gas taxes to provide their residents with financial relief at the pump. Think about it: Cutting the cash-register cost of a product at the consumer level is hardly inflationary. Gas-tax holidays are arguably a short-sighted transportation funding policy, but they are clearly not causing inflation.</p><p>Robin Hood Income Transfer</p><p>That brings us to the last category: economic- and inflation-relief payments. Let's just call them \"stagflation relief.\" Today, California is the biggest of these, with a new program underway to offset household inflation. Although it's officially labeled a middle-class tax refund, its proponents have gone out of their way to tout it as blue-state relief to household budgets to counter rising prices in the face of slowed economic growth. The payments are scaled inversely to household income \u2014 with descending payments at higher incomes that shrivel to zero at the highest end \u2014 so it's hardly a \"rebate.\" In reality, it's a progressives' Robin Hood income-transfer scheme on both the tax and spending sides.</p><p>Meanwhile, California is already seeing a fall-off in income-tax revenues because of stock market losses that have shriveled its typically huge revenue source of capital-gains taxes, so I'd say it's a dubious fiscal policy to be refunding taxes from an eroding base when the state's rainy-day fund may soon need infusions for the next fiscal year. But this was election season, after all. And we all remember the grandstanding Trump stimulus check signatures in 2020, so both political parties play this game.</p><p>At the end of the day, the California payments are clearly a macroeconomic injection of cash at a time when the economy is running at full employment, which undoubtedly adds fuel to the inflation fire locally, at least in theory. However, the real-world problem for inflation-hawk critics and political spin doctors is that it's really only a single drop of diesel on a forest fire: The total of these one-time payments is about $10 billion in a $3 trillion statewide economy. By the time that money gets to the grocery stores, it's a rounding error in the Golden State's total consumption. Even if every dollar of this largesse went to price increases and not the base costs of goods and services, it would contribute one-third of 1 percent to inflation in California, and just 0.03 percent to the national consumer price index.</p><p>When you add up all of the new state-level stimulus programs getting underway across the country, totaling about $31 billion, you get a national inflation impact of just a fraction of one-tenth of 1 percent. Bottom line: The inflation-kvetching about these states' fiscal palliatives for households is overblown.</p><p>Governing's opinion columns reflect the views of their authors and not necessarily those of Governing's editors or management.</p><p>___ (c)2022 Governing Visit Governing at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.governing.com\">www.governing.com</url> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCTRN-202211081GVStateStimulusChecksAreInflationaryNotParticu11081GV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Governing KR</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TH-YJ71-DY8S-B11H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">474203</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Governing</copyright><bodyText><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency</p></bodyText><publicationName>Governing</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Credit: Imran Alsous et al.  </p><p><br/>Clonal dominance is a phenomenon that occurs when descendants (i.e., clones) of one or more founder cells in an organism contribute disproportionally to the system's final structure as the tissue grows. This phenomenon is associated with numerous biological processes, including bacterial growth and the genesis of tumors. While numerous studies have investigated clonal dominance, its origin is still is poorly understood. <br/><br/> Researchers from Princeton University, the Flatiron Institute in New York, and Jo\u017eef Stefan Institue in Slovenia have recently carried out a study investigating clonal dominance in the egg chamber of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a biological system in which the collective growth dynamics of cells[1] can be easily reconstructed. Their paper[2], published in Nature Physics, suggests that clonal dominance can emerge spontaneously in excitable cell networks. <br/> The fruit fly egg chamber is a multicellular system made up of a cluster of 16 germ cells, encased by a layer of epithelial cells. The cells in both these types of tissues are connected by ring canals, stabilized intercellular bridges that connect the two daughter cells arising from a division. Therefore, scientists can reconstruct cell lineage trees simply by tracing the ring canal connections between cells. <br/> Lineage tracing techniques, a set of tools used to identify and track cell populations in vivo, have advanced significantly over the past few years. These are particularly promising for studies examining complex, 3D and heterogeneous tissues, containing 10s or 100s of thousands of cells. The egg chamber epithelium, which has fewer cells that form a single layer, is much simpler and is therefore well suited for lineage tracing.  <br/> \"In the egg chamber epithelium, descendants remain, for the most part, connected to each other through ring canals, making cell lineage tracing more straightforward,\" Jasmin Imran Alsous and Jan Rozman, two of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"In addition, this system has a relatively clear start and end points for cell divisions: starting with ~50 cells and ending with ~1,000.\" <br/> A series of past studies led by Lynn Cooley at Yale Medical School and Alan Spradling at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, identified the various ring canal proteins, as well as the number and location of founding stem cells that give rise to the epithelium, respectively. The recent work by Imran Alsous, Rozman and their colleagues built on these previous findings. <br/><br/>\"In our previous work[3], we focused almost exclusively on the cluster of 16 germ cells where ring canals are quite large, growing from ~1 micron to ~10 microns in the larger egg chambers, and allowing passage of most RNAs, proteins and organelles,\" Imran Alsous said. \"Using 3D imaging, image processing and theory, we showed that as these cells grow, they do so unequally and that the resulting differential growth pattern could be rationalized by accounting for polarized transport through the ring canals.\" <br/> In a subsequent paper[4], Imran Alsous and her colleagues also investigated how these germ cells pack within an enclosure, given the topological constraints they uncovered. In the summer of 2018, they received a vial of fruit flies from another researcher, in which a protein that localizes to the ring canals was labeled, so that ring canals could be seen through fluorescence microscopy. They thus decided to investigate the extent of cell connections in the epithelium. <br/> \"In the germ cells, ring canals have been shown to be important for synchronizing the divisions that give rise to the 16-cell cluster\u2014going from 1 cell to a 2-, 4-, 8-, and eventually a -16 cell cluster,\" Imran Alsous explained. \"Previous studies had already shown that ring canals in the epithelium are actually smaller than those connecting the germ cells, on the order of ~300 nm, but are nonetheless large enough to allow protein equilibration between connected cells through diffusion.\" <br/> Using the sample they received from their colleagues, the researchers decided to trace cell connections in the epithelium in egg chambers at various stages of development, where epithelia had anywhere between ~50 cells and ~1000 cells. Their study was conducted largely out of curiosity.  <br/> \"When we first started this project, in the summer of 2018, I was set to leave Princeton relatively soon,\" Imran Alsous said. \"My co-author, Jan, was on a summer internship at Princeton.\" <br/> When they first started tracing cell connections in their sample, the researchers quickly realized that connected cells formed clusters that varied greatly in size. While some of these clusters contained a few or a dozen cells, others could contain hundreds of cells. The team expected to find a certain degree of variation in the size of cell clusters, however the differences they observed were far more pronounced than they anticipated. Their observations suggest that while some cells divided often, others rarely did. <br/> After they observed large clusters of cells, Imran Alsous, Rozman and their colleagues set out to explain the origin of these clusters. Previous studies gathered valuable insight that informed their efforts, specifically delineating two facts about the fruit fly egg chamber epithelium. Firstly, studies found that in this system, the ring canals connecting cells are large enough for proteins to move through them and cross between cells. Secondly, researchers observed cell divisions in adjacent cells more often than one would expect to observe if cell division was randomly initiated.  <br/> \"Combining these facts, we came upon the hypothesis that dominance could emerge because cell divisions are coupled in the epithelium (i.e., when a cell starts to divide, mitosis promoting factors could diffuse through ring canals into adjacent cells, inducing them to also divide),\" Imran Alsous and Rozman said. \"To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model[5] for the growing egg chamber epithelium, based on an older model that notionally represented the spread of forest fires.\" <br/> The original version of the 'forest fire' model adapted by Imran Alsous, Rozman and their colleagues shows spaces on a grid that can either be filled by a normal tree, a burning tree or nothing (i.e., they previously contained a tree that burned down). The trees could catch fire either spontaneously (representing, e.g., a lightning strike) or from an adjacent burning tree. Empty spaces in the grid, on the other hand, could potentially host a newly grown tree. <br/> In the adapted version of the model devised by the researchers, the tree grid was replaced by a network of cells connected by ring canals. Trees corresponded to a cell that can divide, burning trees to cells that were in the process of dividing, and empty spaces to daughter cells[6] that resulted from a cell division, which are in turn not yet capable of dividing. <br/> \"Cells could divide either spontaneously or be induced to divide by a linked dividing cell, reminiscent of a fire jumping between trees,\" Imran Alsous and Rozman said. \"Unlike a traditional 'forest fire' model, each new division also added a new node (i.e., the new cell emerging from the division), thereby growing the network. Using this representation of the growing epithelium, we showed that coupling of cell divisions could indeed lead to the sizes of dominant clones observed in the egg chamber, capturing their statistics and dynamics of their emergence.\" <br/> The study offers new insight about clonal dominance in the fruit fly egg chamber epithelium. Most notably, it outlines a possible explanation for the emergence of dominant clones resulting from cell division coupling.  <br/> In addition, the findings offer additional evidence for the excitable nature of cell cycle and gene regulatory processes. The excitable nature of these processes, already highlighted by past studies, was also previously confirmed by both genetic and biochemical experiments.  <br/> \"Our opinion is that the study almost opens as many questions as it answers,\" Imran Alsous and Rozman said. \"For example, while it shows a possible means for the emergence of dominant clones, it is not clear if and how clonal dominance and division coupling confers an advantage to the developing system. Speculatively, it could result in faster growth or play a role in tissue scale coordination such as cell divisions stopping at ~1,000 total cells.\"  <br/> In their next studies, the authors also plan to explore how topological links (i.e., the ring canals) affect the tiling of surfaces and tissue-scale dynamics, as they have previously done in a study[7]focused on the packing of the 16 germ cells[8]. <br/> \"The 'forest fire' model in the paper is topological in nature and it doesn't account for the spatial constraints of the tissue and how growing clusters can interact or affect each other's' growth,\" Imran Alsous and Rozman added. \"Therefore, a much more extensive model and experimental measurements would be required to understand this.\" Explore further <br/> Oocyte growth relies on physical phenomena that drive smaller cells to dump their contents into a larger cell[9] More information: Jasmin Imran Alsous et al, Clonal Dominance in Excitable Cell Networks, Nature Physics (2021).

More disturbing is the fact that the same report noted that only 14% of those small businesses are prepared to defend themselves. The fact is all businesses operate within a digital ecosystem in which the security weaknesses of one can impact many others. Agents and their small business clients must first understand and then tackle their cybersecurity weaknesses before they are crippled by them.</p><p>MYTH 2: Cybersecurity Is an 'IT' Issue</p><p>Cybersecurity has become a core business survival challenge, not just an \"IT\" issue for all businesses, regardless of size. Every member of an agency's staff or those of its clients play a critical role in fending off phishing attacks and mastering other essential practices of cyber hygiene. While it is unfair to paint all IT professionals with the same brush, not all IT firms are equipped to manage today's cybersecurity challenges, which unfortunately are metastasizing rapidly. The IT mission emphasizes functionality, i.e., keeping everything running smoothly, while the security function focuses on detection and mitigation of data breaches. Cybersecurity requires different skill sets and special certification. Some larger insurance agencies now acknowledge the differences and have split the two functions into separate departments.</p><p>MYTH 3: Strong Firewalls Provide Sufficient Protection</p><p>Too many agents insist that because they have deployed strong firewalls and immediately apply security patches when announced, they maintain adequate protection. Cybercriminals are always on the hunt for weaknesses wherever possible. Over reliance on a firewall is risky in the same way medieval lords relied exclusively on high castle walls. Once breached, attackers could move at will inside the castle to wreak havoc. Better to have a moat, high walls and two or three sets of gates to thwart attacks. Similarly, cybersecurity professionals say a defense-in-depth model delivers strong protection in which multiple layers of security are deployed, i.e., not just one roadblock but three or four roadblocks so if one fails, three more stand in the way. That's why the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is growing quickly though it is only one of many important tools.</p><p>MYTH 4: Prevention and Recovery - Two Sides Of Cybersecurity</p><p>Even the best cybersecurity systems can be compromised - no system is perfect and never will be. At the same time, the cost of a data breach can skyrocket the longer it remains undetected in much the same way as a forest fire can spread out of control if action to contain it is delayed. The average time to detect and contain a data breach is 287 days, according to the Cost of a Data Breach Report, conducted by Ponemon Institute and analyzed by IBM Security. The answer is 24/7 early warning detection that searches for known threats and out-of-the-ordinary behavior whatever the source so threats can be removed or contained quickly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLINJN-ij641754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLINJN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6434-3W91-DY07-D17V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465774</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2021 Wells Media Group, Inc.

Appearing on America's Newsroom Thursday, conservative financial talk radio host Dave Ramsey blasted the idea of $1,400 stimulus checks by arguing that recipients' financial difficulties are not related directly to the pandemic. 'I don't believe in a stimulus check,' Ramsey said flatly. 'Because if $600 or $1400 changes your life, you were pretty much screwed already. You've got other issues going on. You have a career problem, you have a debt problem, you have a relationship problem, or a mental health problem. Something else is going on if $600 changes your life.' Ramsey added that the checks amounted to 'peeing on a forest fire.' On his website, Ramsey advocates[2] having an emergency fund of at least $1,000 (with a goal of eventually saving 3-6 months of income). A CBS News survey found that only 39 percent of Americans[3] could cover a $1,000 emergency without borrowing the money.

Suburban fire departments that are part of the Mutual Aid Box Alarm System joined the CFD in the drill, which featured training props, manikins as simulated victims and live fire conditions. In the background, streams are attacking a fire in a plane prop.</p><p>1. ROCHESTER, NY, APRIL 29-Members of the Rochester Fire Department were dispatched for a report of a house fire. Upon arrival, Engine 5 reported heavy smoke showing from the second floor and attic of a two-and-a-half-story wood-frame dwelling. Companies quickly stretched lines to the fire floors and worked to knock down the heavy fire while other crews stretched a line to protect an exposure on the Bravo side. Firefighters were able to contain the fire and hold it from spreading. Extensive overhaul was necessary to chase some stubborn hot spots in the structure.</p><p>Photo by Jon Tenca</p><p>2. BALTIMORE, MAY 16-At 7:52 a.m., Baltimore City Fire Department 9-1-1 operators began taking calls for reports of a house on fire, with people trapped inside, in Southwest Baltimore, which triggered a one-alarm assignment at 7:53 a.m. Engine 14 arrived to find fire showing from a two-story, middle-of-the-group row house. Firefighters began an aggressive interior attack. One civilian was found after that individual jumped from the second-floor window of the burning home. Battalion 3 arrived and transmitted a working fire with a special call for an additional EMS unit to tend to the injured civilian. When units arrived in the rear, they reported extension to both adjoining houses. A second alarm was transmitted at 7:59 a.m. Firefighters brought the fire under control at 8:48 a.m.</p><p>Photo courtesy of Baltimore Firefighters Union IAFF L-734</p><p>3. WEST TUCKERTON, NJ, MAY 13-The West Tuckerton Fire Company arrived at the site of a reported structure fire to find heavy fire through the roof of a three-story apartment building. Mutual aid was requested from the Barnegat Fire Company, the Mystic Island Volunteer Fire Company, the New Gretna Volunteer Fire Department, the Parkertown Volunteer Fire Company, the Stafford Township Fire Prevention Bureau and the Tuckerton Fire Department. Because the fire spread to the woods, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service was called, too. Crews knocked down the fire within one hour.</p><p>Photo by Roman Isaryk Jr.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FIREHS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FIREHS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63BM-Y1G1-DYPC-31XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293676</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"413\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Endeavor Business Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FIREHOUSE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29128\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 46</volume><issueNumber>No. 7</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 2021</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001544</classCode><className>SECURITY &amp; ALARM SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DO4Y</classCode><className>TOWNHOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001544</classCode><className>SECURITY &amp; ALARM SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N115300CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GX550</classCode><className>ROCHESTER, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And yet the impact on the economy at large is likely to be so tiny that it will be hard to measure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biden <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/student-loans-joe-biden-white-house/index.html\">announced</url> Wednesday that his administration will forgive $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year. Low-income borrowers who went to college on Pell Grants will receive up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This debt relief will give <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html\">tens of millions of borrowers some breathing room </url>at a time when the cost of living has skyrocketed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critically, the cancellation of student debt is being paired with a plan to lift the freeze on federal student debt<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>payments, beginning in January 2023. That means many Americans who haven't had to pay down student loans since March 2020 will have to begin doing so, eating into their cash flows.</p><p>Despite fears that Biden's student debt relief will fuel already-crippling inflation, economists say the combined impact will be minimal on the economy at large.</p><p>\"The end of the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while the debt forgiveness will support growth and inflation,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN. \"The net of these cross-currents is largely a wash.\"</p><p>Moody's estimates that the combined impact will reduce real GDP in 2023 by 0.05 percentage points, drive down unemployment by 0.02 percentage points and cut inflation by 0.03 percentage points. In other words, a very tiny effect.</p><p>\"We're not talking about raising or lowering inflation by a percentage point or even a half a percentage point. We're talking about a really small impact,\" Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN in a phone interview. \"But for individuals this makes a big difference. It wipes out more than half the debt for more than half the borrowers. That's a big deal.\"</p><p>Tens of millions of borrowers impacted</p><p>The typical undergraduate student with loans graduates with nearly $25,000 in debt, according to a Department of Education analysis cited by the White House.</p><p>Up to 43 million borrowers will receive relief from Biden's student debt plan, including eliminating the full remaining balance for about 20 million borrowers, according to the White House.</p><p>The inflationary impact would have been larger if Biden did not impose an income threshold on the debt relief or if he heeded calls from some progressives to wipe out $50,000 in student debt.</p><p>Baker praised Biden's plan as a \"good compromise\" that avoided going to extremes.</p><p>\"It's helping people out, but not giving away the store,\" he said.</p><p>Some groups, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/perspectives/student-loan-debt-biden-naacp/index.html\">including the NAACP</url>, argue Biden's debt relief doesn't go far enough given the mountain of student debt in America.</p><p>\"Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" NAACP leaders wrote in a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/perspectives/student-loan-debt-biden-naacp/index.html\">CNN Business opinion piece</url>.</p><p>A $300 billion price tag</p><p>Of course, there is a cost to canceling student debt. And that cost will be picked up by taxpayers just when deficit reduction had suddenly become a bipartisan trend in Washington.</p><p>A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning less than $125,000 will cost the government approximately $300 billion, according to an estimate this week from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. (The Penn Wharton model did not include the cost of wiping out up to $20,000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients).</p><p>Although $300 billion isn't massive for a $25 trillion economy, the cost of the student debt forgiveness would cancel out the projected federal budget deficit savings from the just-passed Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>\"All the deficit reduction will be wiped out,\" Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN's Poppy Harlow.</p><p>Note that the White House has hailed the deficit reduction aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act as an important inflation-fighting measure. And this marked a significant shift after years of both parties adding to America's mountain of debt to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Even Jason Furman, head of the Council of Economic Advisers for former President Barack Obama, has doubts about Biden's plan.</p><p>\"Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1562503985529233410\">Furman tweeted</url>. \"Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.\"</p><p>Still, said Zandi of Moody's, this is a \"big positive deal for probably close to 40 million, mostly lower and middle income, Americans, but [a] small negative deal for all American taxpayers.\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></p><p>'Sends the wrong message'</p><p>Beyond the economic impact, Biden's plan has sparked questions about fairness because it only helps people who were fortunate enough to go to college.</p><p>Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Senate Democratic nominee, said Biden's decision on student debt \"sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet.\"</p><p>\"Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans,\" Ryan said.</p><p>Citing a Department of Education analysis, the White House said nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000.</p><p>The student debt forgiveness comes too late for borrowers who worked for years to pay off their loans, only to now see others have their debt wiped away.</p><p>\"I take that very seriously,\" Baker said of the fairness concerns. \"We're relieving $10,000, not $50,000 or $100,000. That's why $10,000 is a good number.\"</p><p>The real problem continues</p><p>No matter the amount, wiping out student loan debt doesn't address the underlying problem: College tuition is way too expensive.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2021, the cost of college tuition increased at more than twice the pace of overall inflation, according to Moody's Analytics. That's despite a slowdown in tuition hikes during Covid.</p><p>The basket of goods measured in the Consumer Price Index cost 57% more in 2021 than it did in 2000, while the cost of college tuition soared by 167%, Moody's said.</p><p>It's hard to see how eliminating a chunk of student debt solves that issue. And some, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have warned debt relief could<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>also help raise tuitions.</p><p>\"Costs are out of control. It's absurd people have to borrow large amounts and then struggle to pay it back,\" said Baker. \"That problem is unsolved.\"         </p><p>             By Matt Egan, CNN Business         </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They've flirted with it in doomed bills that would have reauthorized the Higher Education Act-which is typically renewed every five to 10 years but has not received an update since 2008. Meanwhile, the U.S. government's student-debt portfolio has steadily grown to more than $1.5 trillion.</p><p><br/>Today, calls for relief were answered when President Joe Biden announced that his administration would be canceling up to $10,000 in student loans for those with federal debt, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. As long as a borrower makes less than $125,000 a year, or makes less than $250,000 alongside a spouse, they would be eligible for cancellation. The president will also extend the current loan-repayment pause-originally enacted by then-President Donald Trump in March 2020 as a pandemic-relief measure-until December 31.<br/>The debt relief-which by one estimate could cost a total of <url normalizedValue=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/8/23/forgiving-student-loans\">$300 billion</url>-is a massive benefit for Americans who have struggled to repay loans they accrued attending college, whether they completed a degree or not. But equally as important as addressing the damage that student loans have caused is ensuring that Americans aren't saddled with overwhelming debt again. And the underlying issue of college affordability can be addressed only if America once again views higher education as a public good. Belatedly canceling some student debt is what a country does when it refuses to support students up front.<br/>According to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/\">White House fact sheet</url>, 90 percent of Biden's debt relief will go to those who earn less than $75,000 a year-and the administration estimates that 20 million people will have their debt completely canceled.  \"An entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt, at least, for a college degree,\" Biden said at a White House event. \"The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.\" That Democrats arrived at this point at all, though, is a testament to how grim the student-loan crisis has become. A decade and a half ago, Democrats were advocating for small increases in the federal grant program to help low-income students afford college. Over successive presidential campaigns, Democratic hopefuls, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/05/elizabeth-warren-interview-student-loan-forgiveness/629917/?utm_source=feed\">Senator Elizabeth Warren</url> of Massachusetts, have called for canceling most, or all, student debt issued by the government-effectively hitting reset on a broken system. And now the party is announcing one of the largest federal investments in higher education in recent memory.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/06/democrats-debt-cancellation-free-college/591043/?utm_source=feed\">Read: How the Democrats got radical on student debt</url>]<br/>When he was running for president in 2007, Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-release-biden-make-college-affordable\">advocated</url> for a tax credit for college students and a marginal increase in the size of individual Pell Grant awards-tinkering around the edges of solving a brewing mess as America lurched toward a deep recession. From 2006 to 2011, college enrollment grew by 3 million, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/postsecondary.html\">U.S. Census Bureau</url>; at the same time, states began to cut back on their higher-education spending. On average, by 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-higher-education-funding-cuts-have-pushed-costs-to-students\">states were spending</url> 13 percent less per student than they were in 2008.<br/>Historically, when states look to cut their budgets, higher education is one of the first sectors to feel the blade. Polling shows that the majority of Americans agree that a college degree <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/reports/varying-degrees-2022/findings\">pays off</url>. But college, unlike K\"12 schooling, is not universal, and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/26/1113816868/more-americans-are-questioning-whether-college-has-a-positive-impact\">majority of Republicans believe</url> that investment in higher education benefits graduates more than anyone else. So lawmakers have been willing to make students shoulder a greater share of the burden. But this shift leaves those with the fewest resources to pay for college-and those whose families earn a little too much to qualify for Pell Grants-taking on significant debt.<br/>The shift flies in the face of the Framers' view of higher education, though. \"There is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science and literature,\" George Washington, an early proponent of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/09/founders-national-university/571003/?utm_source=feed\">idea of a national university</url>, said in his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/first-annual-address-congress-0\">first address</url> before Congress, in 1790. \"Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.\" Washington, James Madison, Benjamin Rush, and others believed that colleges might be a place where Americans could build a national identity-a place where they could, for lack of better words, become good citizens.<br/>In that spirit, the federal government provided massive investments in the nation's colleges, albeit inequitably-through the Morrill Act, which formed the backbone of state higher-education systems as we know them; the GI Bill; and the Pell Grant program, which directly subsidize students' expenses. But in the past half century, radical investments in higher-education access have dried up. Now a political divide has opened up: Conservative lawmakers-whose voters are more likely not to have attended college-have grown not only suspicious of but in some cases openly hostile toward the enterprise.<br/>[<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/education-gap-explains-american-politics/575113/?utm_source=feed\">Read: America is divided by education</url>]<br/>Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democrats believe that the government should subsidize college education. \"We want our young people to realize that they can have a good future,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.yahoo.com/video/schumer-student-loan-repayment-pause-224925647.html\">Senator Chuck Schumer</url> said in April. \"One of the best, very best, top-of-the-list ways to do it is by canceling student debt.\" He wanted the president to be ambitious and called for giving borrowers $50,000 in relief-\"even going higher after that.\" A month into his administration, though, Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-biden/index.html\">shot down the idea of $50,000</url>, to the chagrin of relief advocates. \"Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,\" the NAACP's Derrick Johnson and Wisdom Cole <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/perspectives/student-loan-debt-biden-naacp/index.html\">argued</url> today. \"It hardly achieves anything-only making a mere dent in the problem.\"<br/>The administration is coupling its announcement with a redesign of payment plans that allows borrowers to cap their monthly loan payments at 5 percent of their discretionary income. But the basic problem remains: Young Americans of modest means can no longer afford to attend their state university by getting a part-time job and taking out a small loan. For millions of students, borrowing thousands of dollars has become the key to paying for an undergraduate degree. Biden's plan will give graduates-and those who have taken out loans but not finished school-some relief, but the need to overhaul a system reliant on debt remains as urgent as ever.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-studentdebtreliefbidenloanforgiveness671223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667G-DNW1-DYY9-J2PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Wildfires pose a serious threat to public safety, property and our natural resources. People cause over 98% of all wildfires in Wisconsin.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 Safer at Home order, we are taking proactive measures by suspending all Department of Natural Resources burning permits until further notice to protect the health and safety of Wisconsinites.</p><p>All burning of debris in barrels, burning of debris piles on the ground, grass or wooded areas is prohibited at this time.</p><p>Most debris fires occur in the spring after the snow-cover melts and before vegetation greening. Spring is when people are outside doing yard clean-up and then choosing to burn leaves, brush and pine needles.</p><p>Burning permits are required by the Wisconsin DNR in many parts of the state to conduct legal and responsible burning in the outdoors. Burning permits are also required by the Wisconsin DNR in DNR forest fire protection areas to conduct burning of legal materials when the ground is not completely snow-covered.</p><p>DNR burning permits do not apply within incorporated cities and villages. These municipalities oftentimes can and do create their own burning permit requirements. In addition, some townships may choose to be much more restrictive than state law and may not allow burning at any time.</p><p>Regardless of where you burn, it is up to you to check with your local municipality for their regulations, even if you have obtained a DNR burning permit. Not sure if your burn location falls within DNR forest fire protection? For a more detailed look, zoom-in to your location on the burning restrictions map.</p><p>Emergency responders and firefighters have an increased need to take pandemic precautions, so they remain available to continue to protect the public from wildfires and reduce the spread of COVID-19. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Remember to report wildfires by dialing 911 immediately.</p><p>Distance is key during this public health emergency. Under the Safer at Home order, we must do all that we can to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Staying home as much as possible and limiting travel to your community is the best way to lower COVID-19 infection rates.</p><p>The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources continues to receive the most up-to-date information and will adjust operations as conditions change. We will also continue to monitor on-the-ground circumstances each day to determine if park closures become necessary.</p><p>Steps To Prevent And Avoid Exposure</p><p>Avoid social gatherings with people of all ages (including playdates and sleepovers, parties, large family dinners, visitors in your home, non-essential workers in your house)</p><p>Frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water</p><p>Cover coughs and sneezes</p><p>Avoid touching your face</p><p>Stay home when able</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123580936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHK-2N01-DYTH-G24K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"500\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 26, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Scorching temperatures, high winds and tinder dry conditions have forced rescues by sea and land, with thousands of people fleeing for their lives with just the clothes on their backs.</p><p>In southern Turkey eight people have died and scores are injured. Hundreds of animals have been killed and countless homes lost in the worst hit areas of Antalya and Bodrum. More than 2,000 TurkishRed Crescent staff and volunteers are on the ground.</p><p>Shafiquzzaman Rabbani, Acting Head of Turkey delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said:</p><p>\"We are very concerned at this week's weather forecast, with temperatures tipped to reach as high as 40 degrees Celsius in Antalya today. Teams of TurkishRed Crescent volunteers and staff are doing everything they can to assist those affected.\"</p><p>TurkishRed Crescent is providing food through its mobile kitchens, distributing water and hygiene kits, and providing shelter and psychosocial support to firefighters and affected communities.</p><p>In Greece, Hellenic Red Cross rescuers and lifeguards have been evacuating trapped people by boat from the settlements of Kamares, Longos and Platiri. Earlier in the week they were helping the fire brigade quell a fire in Patras. Extreme temperatures forecast for this week have teams on high alert.</p><p>ItalianRed Cross has been assisting with evacuations in Sardinia and distributing water and food. They have delivered animal feed to farmers as fires continued over the weekend. More than 800 flare-ups were recorded this weekend, mainly in the south, and firefighters continue to flight blazes in Sicily.</p><p>SpanishRed Cross volunteers have also been busy this weekend assisting at a fire at San Juan reservoir, 70km from Madrid, and 25 RussianRed Cross volunteers are still at the scene of a fire in Karelia, distributing food, water, bedding, hygiene kits and personal protective equipment to people affected.</p><p>IFRC Europe's acting head of Disaster, Climate and Crises Antoine Belair said the increasing number of wildfires year on year across the Mediterranean is linked to climate change causing more extreme weather conditions, including lower rainfall and higher temperatures.</p><p>\"Extreme weather conditions exacerbate risks of these events. Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies remain on high alert, providing support to affected populations, in close coordination with national authorities and firefighter teams,\" he said.</p><p>Footnote: Advice on how to prepare for a forest fire can be viewed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bNLtjHG9dM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bNLtjHG9dM</url></p><p>[Category: Sociological]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7560252 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7560252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6390-FGD1-DYG2-R48B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"480\"/><timeReceived>9:10 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 3, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Joe Biden</url> told the COP26 summit that in Russia \"literally, the tundra is burning\" and that despite his country's \"serious climate problems\" Putin is \"mum on willingness to do anything.\"</p><p>Greenpeace said Russia endured its worst forest fires in modern history this summer.</p><p>Biden's comments prompted the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to respond, \"let's not forget that forests are burning in California.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, after Obama's remark, Zakharova took a similar approach, telling reporters: \"Those baseless accusations raise eyebrows, at the very least.\"</p><p>\"We call upon the United States, the world's second largest greenhouse gas emitter, to refrain from baseless attacks on anyone,\" she said, according to news agency Tass.</p><p>She said the U.S. should \"work jointly on international platforms in order to efficiently tackle negative consequences of climate change.\"</p><p>She said that Russia was developing its low-carbon power generation sector which exceeds 40 percent of energy needs.</p><p>This consists of nuclear, hydroelectric, wind and solar generation and with the addition of natural gas, \"the share will increase to 86 percent, which is among the world's best.\"</p><p>She added that other green measures would be taken as part of Russia's program over the next 15 years to \"conserve energy and raise the economy's energy efficiency.\"</p><p>Critics had pointed to the in-person

Global Methane Pledge at COP26</url> to cut methane emissions 30 percent by 2030.</p><p>However, Russia did join over 100 countries at COP26 in promising to end deforestation by 2030.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Putin's video address, he pledged a carbon-neutral economy by 2060, although this is 10 years later than 2050 net-zero targets that were talked about by many leaders at the summit.</p><p>In his address, he also said that Russia would rely on forest ecosystems to meet its climate goals, telling delegates, \"after all, our country accounts for around 20 percent of the world's

He had been convicted in July 2021 of multiple counts of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber and attempting to traffic in unlawfully harvested timber.</p><p>Between April and August in 2018, Wilke, Shawn Edward Williams, 50, and Lucas Chapman conducted illegal logging operations in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, according to court documents.</p><p>Wilke and accomplices illegally harvested and sold a type of maple tree that is predominately used in the building of musical instruments, documents said.</p><p>This is the first trial where DNA evidence from the maple trees was used to determine the outcome of the investigation, authorities said.</p><p>\"The DNA analysis was so precise that it found the probability of the match being coincidental was approximately one in one undecillion (one followed by 36 zeroes),\" according to the research geneticist Dr. Richard Conn, who was present at the trial.\"</p><p>The DNA evidence proved that the wood Wilke sold was indeed stolen and that Wilke had unlawfully harvested and sold wood from at least seven additional maple trees, although their locations have not been determined, authorities said.</p><p>In August 2018, Wilke and his accomplices attempted to remove a wasp nest from a maple tree they wanted to cut down, using various pesticides and gasoline, and then lit it on fire, according to court documents.</p><p>That fire eventually burned 3,300 acres of land and cost $4.2 million in firefighting resources.</p><p>Wilke's accomplices testified it was Wilke who lit the fire, saying he was last seen standing next to the nest when it was lit.</p><p>Wilke testified it was Williams who had \"attempted a hasty and clumsy harvest of the tree.\"</p><p>According to court documents, Wilke also placed the blame on another person, Michael Parker, whom investigators said wasn't involved at all.</p><p>Prosecutors recommended a 36-month sentence, saying Wilke was the leader of the tree-poaching ring and had started the fire, based on trial testimony.</p><p>The prosecution also alleged Wilke had continued to use methamphetamine and had contact with his girlfriend whom he had \"gone on the run\" with after the fire started.</p><p>They said Wilke had shown no remorse for his actions and did not believe he should pay restitution.</p><p>At sentencing, Judge Benjamin H. Settle concluded the evidence was clear and convincing that Wilke was present when the fire was set, that a member of Wilke's poaching crew set the fire, and that Wilke more likely than not personally set or directed one of his crew to set the fire, even though the jury did not convict Wilke of the two federal counts related to the forest fire.</p><p>But he also said Wilke had made \"positive strides\" while on pretrial release and noted the prison system has become increasingly more complicated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Wilke was ordered to forfeit all of his proceeds from illegal trafficking and will be required to pay restitution to the United States Forest Service. An exact amount has yet to be determined.</p><p>________</p><p>Reporter Ken Park can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kpark@peninsuladailynews.com\">kpark@peninsuladailynews.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2021 Peninsula Daily News</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PEDANW-news20211110PXW4239448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PEDANW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6427-C8C1-F0HF-80YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Black Press Inc.

The agency's foray into cutting-edge drone technology will help improve response to a variety of crisis \u2014 from floods and forest fires to search and rescue operations.</p><p>\"It has everything on our wishlist and will be used in lifesaving missions, as well as for emergency management tasks such as mapping and damage assessment,\" Haywood County Emergency Manager Zack Koonce said. \"We see this new tool as a huge benefit, not only to our department but to the county and to its citizens.\"</p><p>The drone would have proved invaluable during the floods that struck Cruso last August \u2014 when high water, washed-out bridges and massive debris fields rendered areas inaccessible during the early rescue stages.</p><p>\"We could use it for damage assessment and for situational awareness to get a look at what's going on,\" said Richmond.</p><p>The thermal imaging capabilities could also be used to scout for victims. The drone is weather-proof, capable of withstanding rain, dust, dirt and a wide range of temperatures.</p><p>\"The ability to fly in bad weather is something not all drones can do,\" Richmond said. \"We can get up even while it's still raining to start looking for people.\"</p><p>Bells and whistles</p><p>The $15,000 drone is equipped with four cameras: a wide-angle, first-person, zoom and thermal imaging lenses.</p><p>\"Those tools will really help us when we are out in the field saving lives,\" Richmond said.</p><p>The thermal-imaging technology can detect body heat when looking for lost hikers, for example. It doesn't work as well through thick tree canopies during summer, but could prove invaluable during winter months.</p><p>\"The time frame we have to bring somebody back safely changes in the winter. It's more critical to find somebody in a hurry,\" Richmond said.</p><p>The drone can also be mounted with a speaker allowing for real-time communication with responders on the ground.</p><p>\"Say we had a hiker stick on a ledge who couldn't get up or down. We could fly up to them and speak to them through the speaker system and give them some comfort and direction and let them know that help is coming,\" Richmond said.</p><p>It can also be outfitted with a spotlight for reconnaissance during night operations. Meanwhile, the zoom lens has a magnification power of 200x.</p><p>Richmond stressed the drone is purely intended for emergency operations.</p><p>\"It's not there to spy on people or violate their privacy rights. We are only going to fly as needed,\" Richmond said.</p><p>The powerful battery pack has a whopper of a flight time at 40 minutes.</p><p>\"Once I land it, I can take one battery out, put a fresh one in and go right back out,\" Richmond said.</p><p>The forest fire that ripped across Sheepback Mountain in Maggie Valley this spring is another example of the drone's potential applications. A designated air boss is in charge of directing choppers and planes dropping water, but before air support got to the scene, the drone could scout the fire's trajectory.</p><p>\"We could go up and look for the fire line to inform firefighters exactly what's going on and give them a better idea where to start working,\" Richmond said.</p><p>Aside from large-scale emergencies like floods, forest fires and landslides, the drone would be a handy tool for run-of-the-mill structure fires as well.</p><p>\"You can get up above the roof to see where the most intense heat is and provide that situational awareness,\" Richmond said.</p><p>Pioneering new technology</p><p>Until now, emergency services relied on volunteer drone pilots willing to assist in operations with their own personal drones.</p><p>\"Having our own drone gives us the ability to deploy it much faster. We can get started right away. As soon as we get to a scene, we can be in the air within a couple minutes,\" said Richmond.</p><p>While Richmond's official title is public information officer for emergency services, she's also a certified drone pilot \u2014 making her a natural fit to spearhead the new drone program for the agency.</p><p>Along with Richmond, emergency services currently has one other certified drone pilot on staff, and two more in the process of completing their training. Among them is Benny Pullman, who spent 30 years as a flight paramedic with MAMMA, Mission Health's medical helicopter, and is looking forward to flying again, albeit without leaving the ground.</p><p>The drone will also be available to deploy for other departments and agencies through mutual aid agreements.</p><p>In the past, the price tag of an in-house drone with high-tech capabilities was out of reach. The department had been exploring a $30,000 model, when a newer model with all the necessary bells-and-whistles came on the market in March for half the cost.</p><p>\"As technology improves and prices come down, we anticipate tools like drone-mounted thermal cameras will be essential to emergency response,\" said Koonce.</p><p>For now, however, Haywood County is one of the first emergency services agencies in the region to launch its own in-house drone program.</p><p>\"It is a high end tool we are happy to have, but it's a little fun, too,\" Richmond said.</p><p>___ (c)2022 The Mountaineer (Waynesville, N.C.)

Soon, cases were found in other rural counties \u2014 Nye, Lyon, and Elko \u2014 posing another hurdle for public health systems that have been worn thin by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts say the response to the monkeypox virus in rural America may be affected by the patchy resources and bitter politics that are a legacy of the pandemic, challenges that some worry could allow sporadic infections to gain a foothold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cYour embers turn into a forest fire really quickly,\u201d said Brian Castrucci, president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a national nonprofit focused on public health policy. \u201cThe challenge is: Do we have the infrastructure in place in rural America for an adequate response to monkeypox, to COVID, to whatever is next on the horizon?\u201d</p><p>In Humboldt County, local officials galvanized quickly after monkeypox was reported. The local health board issued a news release encouraging residents to be cautious about physical contact and outlining what symptoms to look for \u2014 painful or itchy rashes, fever, and headache, among others.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something we should be afraid of,\u201d Dr. Charles Stringham, the county\u2019s health officer, said in the news release, \u201cbut instead something that each of us can avoid by taking a few relatively simple precautions.\u201d</p><p>Local health officials are in a \u201cprimary prevention role,\u201d Stringham said during an interview. It\u2019s a role that includes educating the community about the virus, monitoring the person who tested positive, and checking in with local physicians.</p><p>State and local public health officials in Nevada said the response in Humboldt County, where nearly 18,000 people live, and similar efforts in other rural communities follow guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. State and local health leaders meet monthly to discuss public health issues, which of late have included the monkeypox virus. They said they\u2019re confident in local responses.</p><p>Still, some residents of rural Nevada said they have been confused about where to find vaccines or whether vaccines were available in their county.</p><p>Stevie Noyes, a resident of Winnemucca, Humboldt County\u2019s largest city, who identifies as pansexual, said she wouldn\u2019t know where to go to get a vaccine for monkeypox. She called a local retail pharmacy, where her family usually gets vaccines, in early September and was told the pharmacy didn\u2019t have monkeypox vaccines. The pharmacist didn\u2019t know where she could find one in town.</p><p>Noyes, a 34-year-old hairdresser, said she\u2019s not urgently concerned about monkeypox because no other cases have been detected in the county. Should the virus begin to spread, however, she said, members of the local LGBTQ+ community would lean on one another, rather than local county or health officials.</p><p>County and health officials \u201ctake a lot of heat from the town\u201d on the politics of responding to public health issues, Noyes said. \u201cWhat I see a lot is that political influence to where it does curb what\u2019s released and it does curb the steps that are taken.\u201d</p><p>Despite the venomous discourse Noyes has witnessed, Stringham said that in his experience, the monkeypox virus has not been difficult to respond to politically, especially compared with COVID.</p><p>CDC data shows that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic men who have sex with other men are overrepresented in infections across the country. LGBTQ+ advocates have said they\u2019re concerned that the government response wasn\u2019t reaching their communities even though they are disproportionately affected.</p><p>In larger cities, such as Las Vegas, officials have partnered with LGBTQ+ community centers to promote awareness and to distribute educational materials and vaccines. But there is no similar center in Humboldt County, where 57% of voters opposed a ballot question in 2020 that reversed a provision in the state\u2019s constitution that banned same-sex marriage. Statewide, the ballot measure was approved by 62% of voters.</p><p>Noyes said she\u2019s more concerned about prejudice than the virus and fears that because the virus has been linked to men who have sex with men, it could spark retribution against people who identify as LGBTQ+ in Humboldt County. \u201cA lot of these people, the more you interact with them, the more emboldened and, I mean, eventually dangerous they become,\u201d she said.</p><p>Some people in Winnemucca have been outspoken about calling monkeypox a \u201cgay virus\u201d and making jokes on Facebook, she said.</p><p>In late September, Noyes helped host Winnemucca\u2019s second Pride festival. Immunize Nevada, a nonprofit organization focused on providing vaccines across the state, was there to provide information about COVID-19 and monkeypox.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to combat it that way,\u201d Noyes said.</p><p>Kristy Zigenis, program manager for the state\u2019s immunization program, said responding to the monkeypox virus in rural places requires nuance. \u201cIf we were to hold a clinic in, say, a rural area, not all of those people might be ready to share with the world that they have participated in this behavior,\u201d Zigenis said.</p><p>She added that public health officials have encountered affected people in Clark County, the home of Las Vegas, who weren\u2019t prepared to share their sexual partners\u2019 names during contact tracing or couldn\u2019t identify their partners. \u201cI think that probably crosses a bit into the rurals as far as what\u2019s going on with the case count,\u201d she said.</p><p>As of Oct. 26, there were 28,087 confirmed cases of the monkeypox virus nationwide, according to the CDC, and 298 in Nevada, putting the state in the second-highest tier for transmission. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Clark County, where more than two-thirds of the state\u2019s residents live, but cases have been reported in four rural counties.</p><p>Because it\u2019s unclear whether monkeypox has spread beyond the one detected case in Humboldt County, Stringham said he\u2019s trying to provide enough messaging to keep residents informed, but not too much to cause burnout.</p><p>He said he thinks resources would be better directed toward prevention of COVID, adding that the situation could change.</p><p>To make matters more difficult, the community health nurse, who is responsible for distributing the vaccine from a state-run clinic in Winnemucca, retired months ago, and her replacement, a nurse from Carson City, didn\u2019t arrive until October.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re working in a bit of a deficit in that respect,\u201d Stringham said.</p><p>During the interim, Zigenis said, Humboldt County residents who met the eligibility requirements to receive a monkeypox vaccine needed to see an administrative assistant in the Winnemucca Community Health Nursing Services office, where 100 doses of the Jynneos vaccine were available. The state agency would then dispatch someone to Humboldt County to administer the vaccine.</p><p>Experts say that gap is emblematic of the kinds of difficulties that officials in rural communities across the country face when responding to public health issues.</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is there may be people who aren\u2019t seeking primary care, so cases aren\u2019t getting picked up,\u201d Castrucci said. He added that the focus of resources on COVID or monkeypox can cause other health issues to fall through the cracks, especially considering the lack of investment in local public health departments in rural America compared with departments in larger cities.</p><p>___ (KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

Some live in nations embroiled in turmoil from war. The only conflict in the area near the campus was that between firefighters and flames, but it's been unnerving for some students. When the school was first ordered to evacuate, Esther Mbandeka of Namibia said the scene was unforgettable.</p><p>\"It was just gray, and everyone felt like it was an apocalypse,\" she said.</p><p>As the tension grew, Mbandeka and Nathan said students tried to stay calm by telling jokes and singing songs. During their first night, Nathan said students slept on cots in an auditorium at New Mexico Highlands, warmed by wool blankets.</p><p>The lessons from the fire have been obvious to many at the school: United World College President Victoria Mora said this year's fire has brought her students face-to-face with the effects of climate change and the tragedy it has caused.</p><p>\"Our mission is to make education a force for peace and a sustainable future. And so, any student who comes to us already is thinking about those issues,\" Mora said. \"This fire, for better or for worse, is an amazing tutorial into climate change, and they're seeing it firsthand. They're seeing people displaced.\"</p><p>Student Ruby Mahoney of Maine said she had never dealt with a wildfire until she came to New Mexico for school.</p><p>\"Our experience and the experience of so many people in New Mexico right now is proof of the climate catastrophe. And it's going to get worse if nothing's done,\" said Mahoney, 18. \"Those that have power need to step up and meet the challenge of climate change, before it's too late.\"</p><p>Mahoney said the anxiety mounted as the school learned the fire was creeping closer to campus.</p><p>\"Everyone was obviously really scared of the school burning down because there was a fire last year,\" Mahoney said.</p><p>Nathan said she was used to hearing about wildfires while growing up in Santa Fe but never anything this early in the year.</p><p>\"I have some grief around the wildfires that are caused by climate change,\" Nathan said. \"In school, it's kind of like a cerebral thing where we're talking about environmental systems in class and we're taking tests on it. Now, we're living it and seeing what it actually looks like.\"</p><p>Mbandeka said she wants to learn more about the people in Northern New Mexico who lost their homes in the fires.</p><p>\"I feel like we have to be more understanding and send our prayers out to them. Because I literally cannot even imagine what that has to feel like to have to start over once again,\" Mbandeka said.</p><p>Even before the evacuation order, students already were dealing with the stress of preparing for upcoming exams. Mora said students are scheduled to begin taking International Baccalaureate exams Wednesday. She said second-year students are under additional pressure since they need to pass their exams to graduate.</p><p>As first-year students like Nathan and Mbandeka hung out with friends and played volleyball, some of their peers were hard at work studying on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>\"I feel like a lot of us are just trying to pretend that nothing is happening. Like we don't have school. We don't have exams,\" Mbandek said. \"I feel like it will hit us tomorrow at 9 a.m. when we are actually in class.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWMEX-15665753</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWMEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65C4-6111-DY7H-R001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Santa Fe New Mexican All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Fe New Mexican</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 2, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XAN</classCode><className>DISPLACED PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N923110CC</classCode><className>EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009ERP</classCode><className>UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX578</classCode><className>SANTA FE, NM, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GS147</classCode><className>NEW MEXICO, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC377</classCode><className>NAMIBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
